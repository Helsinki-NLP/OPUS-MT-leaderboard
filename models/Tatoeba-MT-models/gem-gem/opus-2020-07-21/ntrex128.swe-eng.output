AM in Wales is worried to "come as puckon"
Some AM, members of the National Assembly of Wales, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, according to plans, change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
ON the entire political spectrum is concerned about being spotted.
A AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it's rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
For readers that can't walesic: Twp means stupid in walesic and pwp means bajs.
A AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "displeased" and has proposed other options.
A conservative walesar said that his group is "open" for the change of name, but noted that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is spoken in Walesian like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
Assembly Commission, currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is so clear to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Wallic congregation the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the result of a public consultation on the proposals, which found a strong support for calling the House of Wales Parliament.
The current title of the AM proposed the Commission Welsh Parliament's members (the members of Wales parliament) or the WMP, but MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM clearly suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to the functioning of the congregation, including rules for discwalification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to be called when debating legislation.
Macedonia shall carry out a referendum amending the country’s name
On Sunday, the electors shall vote if they are to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to conclude a dispute that has been taking place for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov contradicts the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the result.
However, the people's adherents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they need to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem face problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither nor."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are being associated in other ways now," he said.
"Bars aren't like the living room of the area anymore, your people go on a regular basis."
He is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient as far as the leaders are waiting for and that "before or later they will end on the box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closing of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation who had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a bojkott of shops at 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or transport black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, called the proud music game for "the poor's clocks".
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "a transversible historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the bigger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
In recent months, the events at St. Martin's are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some of the church's plays, others of the episcopal Foundation.
The church official – the congregation's governing body composed of players – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed anxiety that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church council, even though the church council had not been involved when the foundation employed architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Haj hurts 13-year-old dyes after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy who showed up for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and swallowed there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bited!"
"I've been bited!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole key leg had been broken up.
"I cried to all to get up from the water." "It's a hail in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It's unclear what hajart it was.
The Bath Guardian Larry Giles told mass media that a hail had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous hajar.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 hajards in the area, but most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's take off Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a product-house-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK's beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the rapid purchase attempts to fill the shelves previously taken up by TV, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The shop chain also restarts its boutique trademark so that most of the products are veganic – as more and more young customers require.
In addition, the parfum seller Fragrance Shop will test the stand in two Sainsbury shops – the first position opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that fast buying needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more and more like shops in an attempt to fight against cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos status in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The former attempt of the quick purchase to give the beauty and pharmaceutical departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots sales in the fast purchases would be distributed.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million for three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended offer of luxurious skin care products, including the marks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said, "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with a attractive environment in smooth places we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "awesome" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal of £11 million
Dragons Den Star Peter Jones is "awesome" about the fact that the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle mark to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not reach with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones angry by pulling out of their luxurious lifestyle mark in the last minute – to focus on its new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "rassing" at an excited meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite announced that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly at Instagram, Jones fled to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly the priority of Holly.
It would be her long-term future for the next decades.
Her decision to leave shocked all those involved.
No one could think it happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that The Morning presenter's decision to withdraw may cost several millions due to significant investment in everything from coats and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
The threeborn mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as President of March.
The couple holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production companies.
Willoughby is to be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said yesterday night, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard talk, and we got dear.
He was joking that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would regard as "invalid a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "new prosecutor voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump sheltered their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been fixed.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho said to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar response" from the United States after the first disarmament stage of North Korea.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues penalties intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people should have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rocket stars, freed the hostage and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10 000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds of people die
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombox population had lost their homes, an exemption permit was not expressed, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have been very clear that they don't ask for international assistance, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saved children gather a team to go to Palu, but it's still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, speaker of the natural disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared on nature’s anger.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastal lines.
The lack of a tsunami warning surgeon in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's exhausted infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and train rods.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr Jokos' administration before the next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also pressed by conservative sekterist tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs struggled on the streets with maketes, arrowbows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge quit the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his law was left with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick to the outside chair.
The attempt fled high above the target area to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended on the network.
"I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach and didn't think so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half of the game after a goal for 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker healed a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned by close to the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's page.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defence and got the ball on the net at the outside chair with a left-foot kick along Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool struggles with Napoli at the Champions League's group stage at San Paolo Stadium in Naapel, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Death number for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death figure for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sundays.
Many people were reported to have fastened in the wastes of buildings racing in the earthquake of 7.5 which struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six feet, said the Agency’s speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with bread from buildings that were racing.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after the woman is killed
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews at John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspicious of murder.
The police have asked people in the area that saw or heard something to come forward.
Criminal inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I pray to all who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have filed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think that they know the woman arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is in progress and the police will inform the victim's closest family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said nobody can come in or get out of the building.
He became targetless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they get back.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime site.
A crying woman appeared on the site.
She says "it's so terrible" again and again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars in front of the unlock and another right outside.
A number of police assistants were in front of the locking with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's last victims of ruling about the rewrite of history
An explanation was poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "drying" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said, "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 18th century and is part of historiography for a man who many consider still to be caught.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Much, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, Cromwell believes that Cromwell defends Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is subject to a ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly influenced the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His business as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated.
Killing grey kills farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, which is only identified with his surname Yuan, found death with a breast species and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the Province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccine in pigs in a swine path on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan in Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning afterward, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a swine path nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigstone with blood on his mouth.
A legal examination confirmed that the 250 kilograms of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The gris that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and the market responsible are reported negotiations on compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 pounds fastened a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can function as a "catalizer".
"They're just playing.
They're nasing and very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the orchestra Rosa for widely heavy rain to the south-western United States
As predicted, the orchestra Rosa becomes weaker when it is traveling over cooler waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring overflowing rain to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST in Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a tree begins to form over the Pacific and travels east to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tray will create widely strong rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally rain will cause dangerous flooding, leather flows and possibly soil in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to 7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm rain is expected at some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone gets out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons to thundering rivers and forest storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The nearby tray brings some locally strong rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of more than a cm of rain, which can lead to leather flows and stalk roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some shrinked tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can imply intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down, but the troops remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central USA on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start at October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in Eastern USA during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaughs hearing
More than 20 million looked at Thursday's arresting witnesses from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political death situation and the normal broadcast were cancelled for the last minute-twist of Friday – Arizona's senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI, where they had a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure Kavanaugh was pissing on her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said that he was absolutely sure that it was not happening.
It is likely that the number of observers in Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people who look from office.
Similarly, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the end game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presentators have shown a strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during that daytime hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was focused on Friday drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS demonstrators who shouted on him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in the direct consignment of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before his doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the Committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted about if they would forward Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated in the next week, which the minority Democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterward, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses criticism for "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued its attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's customs charges was "fullly unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect of the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basket player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in jail for murder, said the cops of Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he acknowledged that he shot Wayde.
His castle was fixed to $350,000, according to Advocate.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the death cause was a shot year in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's refugee force, the state lawslab of the police, the police of Southern University and the inhabitants of the area for help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU's athlete director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flite and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basket for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basket trainer Will Wade said that the team was "crossed" and "chocksed" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
The volcano asks ash about Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ashes during the course of 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several mules and shells.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital since a earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police is affected together with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Sustainability Consultation
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence demonstrations struck together with demandall police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia Polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by demandallpolis cast eggs and colour powder on them, which led to dark pond clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Slags also broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried "Long Life Spain".
14 people were treated for less damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The vote is still excited in the region that wishes for independence one year after the referendum on October 1st, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was sanctified by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most of those who were opposed to the secession bojkotta the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent collapses last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Individual groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Electric Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"To last we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to vote, but now we've been stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have been difficult to keep the drivers up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-deployed exiles or are waiting for the trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to support the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been celebrated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he would be able to vote for the European Parliament next year.
"Candidate to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undercover we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself were damaged.

Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas strike showed the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's page has still not gained off in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its profit range to six matches – the main trainer Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against opposite visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their justice gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but slept his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot widely after glide in to measure Craig Halkett's necklace across the target.
The home team sat to let Rangers play before them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the centre of the target area.
In that situation Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was inevitable and Liam Kelly target guard was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a salvation from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings were constantly entered into Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two criminal requirements – after Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one for hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal show and results for Livingston.
Each one was unique and continues to exceed the expectations of the road upwards.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honour to have galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unique and led a skillfully organized defence, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the whole.
But Rangers missed inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home page once – and it is some of a wakelock for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited the smile and blue sky (29 September) when Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders for breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become inappropriate with human rights, freedom of pressure and Turkey's entry into the EU.
The Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 observers from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many attendants gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrations – many of them Kurdish – also heard their votes and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dual protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as an envious ruler of others.
Road hole in Deptford: Cyklist dies in crushed with car
A cyclist has died in a crack with a car in London.
The crochet took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-operated road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died on the site.
The crochet takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infectious accident at Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the throat on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been locked off and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in anxiety on a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The worries broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST in Sunday and still running.
Specialized "tornadoguards" have been called there to deal with the anxiety, which involves eight prisoners on a fly.
The guards were treated in place of worse injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff have been sent there to manage the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be addressed to the police and may receive extended prison penalties."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, demandall police was called to the prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with bilird balls.
The orchestra Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the orchestra Rosa moves over the desert in the southwest of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and into south and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a twoth that only "twen tropical cycles have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 65 km from Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with insulated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest of the United States, including central rocky mountains and Great Basin, probably receive 2.5-5 cm rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the Southwest United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drying, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The Orkaan Rosa will first travel over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with ornamental strength in Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and traveling north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may get heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"The total 7,5-15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwest of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and leather flows in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for murder attempts
Three boys in the teen and a 20-year-old man has been arrested suspicious for murder attempts after a 16-year-old found with knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who might have filed what happened with the mobile phone to get out.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, badness, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the democratic party's respectlessness and harmless tactics," said Trump to his attendants in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the badness, anger, from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexually conceived on her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the Congress.
The President said on Saturday, "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skillful legal senses of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his adherents in the audience of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of republikan votes in the next midterm elections.
"We're five weeks from one of our most important choices.
I don't know, but I can't do it," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "resist and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from a assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of climbs
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed to the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to Saturday’s authorities.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu in Friday when up to six feet high waves crashed to the beach in the sky and swallowed out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamin came after a earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victims of tsunamin," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin was not alone but slept with himself cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunamin had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape tsunamin and survive, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a moskee is surrounded by water.
Afterscalf still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The row of earthquakes was felt in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake in Friday was 200 times the size of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bucket, which may have made tsunamin larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the bread of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were damaged and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages may be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donggla, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
The communication from Donggla "was completely lame without any information," said Nugroho.
"It lives over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticized on Saturday because not informed that tsunamin had been struck against Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared in social media, a man on the top of a building hears frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water crashes to the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a comprehensive interruption of power that interrupted all communications around Palu, which impaired the rescue work of the authorities.
The military has begun to send the cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need for food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the assistance work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu where they are looking for protection in the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the bizarre assistance work, but some complained that foreign assistant workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and non-resident employees may only be used if exemption permits are disclosed after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say that it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been expressed."
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of missing people still hoped that their close and dear ones would be the miracles that light up thrilling natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was saved from a cloak.
On Sundays, the rescue workers saved a woman who was stuck at bread for two days with her mother’s body next to herself.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the NCI of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing screen flights in front of Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier a month.
Others attached to Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the screen flight knower, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screen flights heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent desperately WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray bock instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26.750 during bankomatfilling at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink's employee who filled on a banking room at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had empty a banking room in the entertainment plant and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "a different man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspected flights from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the addicts shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper switches name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The being that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which sets up for "sensitive reasons" according to the program's creators.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I am you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of known riders who have changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly cooperated with West, has previously written his name with and without binding lines and versals.
Mexico's AMLO swear not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody recompensation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Trups fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square of October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-right student movements hit root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI funding
Now when China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the sum they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will be after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements on AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming leader in AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for next breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
A double-sized budget can double the chance that next major AI breakdown is made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier a week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most outstanding AI companies – Face++.
At the Carnegie Mellon University of the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that struck the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he sat in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was CEO for Google China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the US government, as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to identify future visionarys.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funds from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think the green cards should be automatically offered to doctors within AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants appropriations to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other authority organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on renewal
The Macedonian people voted Sunday in a referendum on the change of the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would solve a decade of old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining the NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the slave majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts if the minimum participation of 50 per cent is required to be considered valid.
The question of the rolling part of the referendum is: "Are you for membership of the NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the renamer, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is worth renaming if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough of Parliament's members have said that they are going to follow the result to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the state elections Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.00 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered votes voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name, which would open the way for membership of the NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for the NATO and the EU, but we want to join our head in the air, not swallowing in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of euro-asiatic integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, a membership of the NATO would lead to the necessary investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our inhabitants are for the EU and the NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "certification of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Survey Institute, between 30 and 43% of the voters were thought to vote in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50% of the registered voters plus one vote must be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious rebate of the Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes through the whole Brighton defence to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling hit Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's gain at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously easy when he made goals for the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out to the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He went around a defense and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a passing to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about he'd play for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made goals at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial acquisition in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deeply inside Brightons revir on that game.
He sent a fine kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the remote chair.
Sky Blues forward sparked the ball into the net moment before it ended out of range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the end game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a profit of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but still looking for its first division title.
"We're not playing anything, but we can get a chance to gnugg the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at higher level than any other team I'd meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their beginning for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they tend to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated up in the bullet on Thursday and would throw on his normal Vilosday.
Washington's right-hand casters are 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 in this season.
Trump holds talks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of republikan votes in the coming mid-term elections.
"All that we've done is in the game in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I don't know, but I candide, and that's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happens here and now.
They are determined to take the power back whatever is necessary, you see their badness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggle to "stand up and stop".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, "the Democrats are arrogant and bad and terrible and fake."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was addressed by high bowling from the viewers.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Do you make the document?'
'Eh, oh, huh?
No, not, no, no, I'm waiting for a ...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They're not tolerating people who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my local party voted for censuring me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm the last one in a series of MPs from Labour who'll hear that we're not welcome, just because we're saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was opposed to antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar to those that Jeremy criticized earlier leaders for.
The Communication on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcomed and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on peace nights have been exactly that.
But, unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendlyr, more coherent" policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that deviating views are not tolerated in Labour, and each opinion is judged from the point of view of acceptance of the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought had a similar political view as I expected to make a whole conversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have held – whether the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – I follow a tired of unconscious social media that requires me to be disposed of, criticize mine policy and say that I should not even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every mistrust and change in the selection rules, the party becomes all the more tricky.
I've been given a lot of advice for the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it's arranging."
But that was not why I became politician.
Since I joined Labour as a school lifetime 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government's neglect that literally made my primary school classroom collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and it includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my views of policies and issues where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the work on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electoral circuit – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to dispose of me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unattached Ayr on top
Two trials in the last minute may have distorted the result one idea, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertainment Tent's Premiership match.
They're now on top, the only unbound side of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defence, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the profit, and the trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unsuccessful, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a punishment, and at the end of the first half he made points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half of the game and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long waiting for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was caught by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the leadership again with a attempt from Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tackled Climo without the ball made McPherson a touch down from the penal line out behind Ayr's mule.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanken Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter into the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been indicated as CEO for a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, in which he writes and plays with his long-term co-mediate Greg Hempill.
Duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and the Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that the Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blomstered restaurant industry".
"The have belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the Court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seemen patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Flottan's bases from the Titicaca lake to the Amazon's bearing the motto: "The have belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 18th century is still strong – and it is also desired to again sail on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than in many decades now when Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of First October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and is clearly waiting for the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Haag will judge to the benefit of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own exit to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's carismatic indigenous president, who is faced with a controversial battle for reselection next year.
"We are very close to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analytics believe that it is incredible that the Court judges for the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to allocate chilenic territory and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "not was complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been damaged rather than promoted the chances of Bolivia.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive retoric has hurt Chile's remaining well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in Haag, did not consider that the decision of the Court had been unusually rapidly taken.
Monday will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "set a stop for 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we have to go on from the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not settle down its nuclear weapons only if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rivalising leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be at the border to solve the death situation for nuclear weaponsiplomatin more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "worn dream" to continue penalties and the United States' protests against a statement of ending the Korean war will ever embrace North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first initiates significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and the United States President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line of huge main housing on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crushed, over-dimensional headquarters for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blown the style icons on the Paris fashion week.
Unbelievable unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their inevitable creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s primary creation was an overdriven beige hat with a feather-like wide hats that totally took over the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewelry-produced watermelones, a trollcare hat and even an analysis – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had together lips and rather similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature likened a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass tree.
And if you continue the huge courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge hits may be on the way to shops near you.
The over-dimensional hats come right after La Bomba – the halm hat with a 60 cm bracket that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that was behind the incredibly unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathroom as held in it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, with raffinafrans and a white leather handle, excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion week.
FEMAIL said, "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in shops next summer – the designer has had such a great effect that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
Scotland independent schools maintain outstanding akademic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social commitments.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools are seeking to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement custom learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we create relationships and trust in people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarin received an A at Higher Grade, and 72 percent of the students who studied Germans, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as decisive skills as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like topic choices are now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for various reasons employers were difficult to fill their vacancies, with 17% due to a lack of skills in languages.
In this word, language skills are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future career.
With increasing future jobs that require language skills, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a advantage of competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totally came into a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
It is therefore so important to invest in language education for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotland independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future has.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communications capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twoth that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier a week, James was asked for his plans for Lakers' seasonal schedule.
"I don't need a seasonal game in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump takes her first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned events next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In waiting for a confirmatory vote of its candidate to the unemployment of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build up support for future intermediate elections, as the Republicans risk to lose control of the Congress before the current election in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are planned until 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can view Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interrogation by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was exposed to blame for his sexual abuse, with a expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that the next week's five conventions aim to " engage volunteers and adherents when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the Senate and the Representative House", according to Reuters.
"Checking the congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a speaker of the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, planned at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage units in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the republikan Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking for in the opinion surveys.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion surveys," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Clearer Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep the hopes of living in front of Sunday's singers
After three one-sided sessions, the party competitors could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup in Saturday afternoon.
The turning pendel of the moment is a completely invented sport concept, but something that the players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe, of course, has four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have little wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four were.
Spieth has been vase from tea to green and precedes with a good example.
The vineship scalled more than higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive put to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had lying after with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match at 15 met with a similar rod, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deeply and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
It's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's inconclusive story.
Europe's odd, but devastating couples are four out of four, and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the reactions of the audience find that they are the players to turn on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Especially both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to crawl out.
On Sunday, however, no one helps you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better as a law so far and took a significant leadership before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the United States has a struggle that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's fireball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 guide over the United States.
The inspired due Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a defeated Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, who struggled to keep the pokal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really began in the morning's fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more opposition in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, only the second couple is to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who struck through two matches on Saturday, showed samples in a few moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning's fireball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe had no co-wind all the way, but it was a nice, blue day just southwest of Paris.
Three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and returned later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has come back from a fire-point underground in the single matches, however, Furyk's page needs only one undefined result to keep the pokal.
After being the second best for two days, it looks like a mot attack on Sunday may become difficult to get through.
North Korea says that they "never" will disarm one-sided without confidence
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust against the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that over the last year, North Korea had undertaken "decisive measures to demonstrate its well-being", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decombining nuclear test installations and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"By no confidence in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea when it gradually took steps, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject a single nuclear solution just as Pyongyang did before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work against "deviation of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korean security.
North Korea has searched for a formal end of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to facilitate hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist on "deviation first" and increase the pressure through sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even object to the "declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
"The consciousness that penalties can get us on the knee is a wish dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued penalties deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second meeting between Kim and Trump as the leaders of the United States highlighted in the United Nations earlier during the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Corean Penal Islands would not have come to such a death situation."
Still, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the future ability of North Korea to reach the United States' continent with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "restore" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this and said, "if it takes two years, three years or five months," it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the United States State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we achieve a complete, final, confirmed disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to boost the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later for setting "power-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to unmount a missile plant and also a nuclear force complex if the United States took "contradictional measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "compliant measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved against normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has brought all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dyking".
A academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often unreasonable with regard to the foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers is the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after having talked about the impact of sleep shortage on learning.
"On the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the weight of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director for University Health Services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from serious sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive data.
In part of the course, there is a picture of a student room, where the students click on coffee cups, gardines, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortness and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change the behavior of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of picking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The proud culture of "dying" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep shortage was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapons" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctors to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the High Practice Institute.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to sit and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn in the day, leading to insomning problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's inequal side to a 1-0-down team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for taking home its first victory on the road since February's 4-1-triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-hour and Rangers never managed to eliminate the result.
While Rangers is now falling down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind the Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be more problems on the hell for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head year after an object was thrown from the outside end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a score of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-moorded games overglin the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been two minutes in the game when Mengas first passport released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A free park on the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain of Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back of the chair.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson vivided the admonition of the Colombian.
Rangers was only able to make two goals in the first half of the game, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly easily accepted Lassana Coulibalys nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots in 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servant deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's firm situation.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fits Scott Robinson, who stayed calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outer hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to make the opponents play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long passing after long passing.
Holt's side could have strengthened its leadership in the last stage, but McGregor was well able to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
The Rangers replacer Glenn Middleton had another late demand for punishment when he was punished with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanack: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the manick called Geiger Measurer.
Geigermeters have become a foundation for science since then and also figure great in popculture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the apparent unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN, "What in the whole world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigermeter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these horns on you, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms of radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans, "Yes, it pops now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her eggstock scancercellers disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common for many cancer forms called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, eggstock, lung and thick intestine cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Canye West supported Trump by carrying a MAGA crew, after its SNL performance.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was bowed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimming appearance where he praised the US President Donald Trump and said that he would apply himself for the entry 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he had a Make America Great crew, he relieved against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star deceived Brett Kavanaugh’s witness to the Senate’s Legal Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not sent, the playback of West's design was loaded on social media by the comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been disturbed backstage for his head bone.
"They mobbed me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out there with that creep."
They mocked me!
And then they say I was low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Will you also sink lowly?" and said that he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed arrogant, reported Variety. One person said, "It became the deadlyst in the studio."
West had come in as a later replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed for a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the Chief of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twins: "To one of the most courageous souls: TACK TO THAT YOU STOD TO DIG TO MOT MOBBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, twisted that West was simply "self and it's totally wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embraced and spread a ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're there, she added.
Before the show announced the raper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollegin, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist known as Prince.

The accusations will be examined by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington struggles against toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereo type of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen means that young boys often feel that they must be hard to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic maskulinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his companion player in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even her 31, acknowledged that he felt "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I feel quite strong personally, right now - where have we been wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculinous characters.
He continued "What's inherited and what's introduced?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the major issues of our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he wouldn't do any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says he's "finished with battle fields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character Jon Snow loves, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family ownership in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase by 14% of the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says healthcare authorities.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese healthcare authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through collection is an acute issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination by HBT persons is reported to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men earlier or later will marry women.
Many of the infectious cases are due to insufficient protection in collecting in these relations.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of the efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to leak the tasks of the GOP sensor, shields on "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday claims that one of her employees had posted personal data on three American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were spread by right-extremistic websites.
"Laughs, lies, and more disappointable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information included home addresses and telephone numbers to the senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate Panel's hearing of the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of the Water staff, reported Hill.
"This unreasoned claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been endangered as a result of these deceitful and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unreasoned claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized online, including from the former Vita House's press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," said Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't be proud.
They may not question the objection of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's response to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was able to put Waters down in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Store of true," he twisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal prosecution being of these deceitful requirements.
"We will ensure that the actors will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodie by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new British slope film, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action komedin - a series of spy parodies kicked in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the satir of how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received its license to customer to the case for the second time renewed - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English speaking countries
He is of course the stupid secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a gnutta Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two fine moments in the latest J.E. film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor leaves hit his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedium is shown, but the humor feels quite low-mealed and strangely overwhelming, especially because the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offer comedium as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted to children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English's strange appearance is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumm film brafar in the role of Bean.
The current issue is now that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret web network of spys in the United Kingdom, which reveals the identity of all the United Kingdom agents out of the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of the service - an enormous little role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last strike for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hardly employed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of its political popularity: Emma Thompson does its best with this quasi-Teresa-May caracter but the manus offers not much to work with.
Her notifying adviser informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who is retired.
And that means the tribe Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher of a well-beared institution, but which offers inofficial lessons in the art to work undercover next to.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an acute meeting and reunited with its former long-live sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a sub-bot, a jolly-hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to disposed of.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terrible wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and hit Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the carismatic technician, who claims that he can solve the British computer fraction: the unfortunate Jason Volta, which is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of far-fashioned trains: dressed for servators, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on the Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchie when he trys to use a VR-head to know the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of jobs behind the last sequence, but despite the charming and speedful film, it has a air of child TV around itself.
Something moderate as everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't stop thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies the preparation of a plan for British to work a four-day week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour considers a radical plan that goes on the British work for a four-day week - but is paid for five.
According to the party, business leaders wish to transfer savings made by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra vacant day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend, but keep the same wages.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" to the party's economic agenda in favour of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by the trade union Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that suits the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during his election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not listed by Labour as a whole.
A speaker for Labour said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there's nothing that the party agrees on."
Shadow Cancer John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate its vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "sightless leaders" and "sniller" on state companies.
The plans of the Shadow Cancer also mean that the current shareholders of aquatic companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour government can make "deductions" because of what they believe have been incorrect actions.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in business management and create the so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stand for annual distributions of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV programme "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change the position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unreasonable.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamic tank creation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she named couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a huge impressive setting of stars that act and a similar impressive assignment; fighting the world poverty.
Now during its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people whale to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: fighting extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international prominent group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, mail a world leader, call or in other meaning help to increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from their followers who struggled for a variety of different objectives.
It says that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected have hitherto had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are involved in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promised to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combat undernutting in the area after having received more than $4 700 twots from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just as you, we can make social injustice as undernutting is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Partnership Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken which require Britain to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great citizens' rights and anti-apartness movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at the year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicates the Ministry of Home Affairs
The government can "as necessary" attack its fleet in order to prevent Russian energy players from turning into markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed American domestic minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a precaution to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's southern parts," he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to deal with it.
"United States have the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the lakes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while he referred to Russia as a "day land" with a economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
After the Trump administration has been aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump Administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressures and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was rejected from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I do not like a third party to interfere with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Industries (BDI) after a meeting between the Federal Cancer Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to set up in the presidential election 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential elections after the U.S. Intermediate elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our violent government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to the Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll take a real thinker to take the president's post."
Warren weighed in to President Donald Trump at the Council meeting and said "he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been voluntary in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a twoth on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own followers did not believe that she would be able to make it in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be able, according to an investigation conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate hours.
The study showed more support for a candidate tour of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking herbs in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday evening
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he is back, I can relate to other families who have experienced PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back struggled, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of violence at home against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on violence in the home and arms holding in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a speaker of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, and Columbia District supports the question of a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing unrelated violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the dears in the Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent beng members," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations faced with major problems of gangs and violence at home.
The new American asylum policy changed a decision by the immigration authorities from 2014 which made it possible for illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape from violence at home.
The district of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances applicable to the requirement, and such a provision contradicts that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the American economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "lever the necessary labour force".
The Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered Judge in the case of asylum in June to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled violence in home and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to facilitate all the problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death figure is doubled in the hunting of survivors
For the survivors the situation seemed more and more harder.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feeble boy in a evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance's picking up dead bodies all the time.
Pure water is a defect."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rotting through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were damaged and hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake of 7.5 were overfull.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, suffered by a broken back and axle, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong afterscalves.
With tear - filled eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't flee.
I was pressed into the wall ruins, I think," told Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador charges China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in Des Moines Register - State Iowas's best selling newspaper - after accusing China to try to participate in the Sixth Congress elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to mix into American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked into an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's remuneration tariffs were designed early in the trade war to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Peking had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, " now doubles the mobbing by putting out propaganda ads into our own free press."
"China's government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free pressure to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper ski on the street here in Peking, you will find a limited number of deviating votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's worse economy, as the media are controlled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female electors in the middle-year election through Kavanaugh fiaskot, warns analytics
Since many top Republicans defend the nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, which is faced with several accusations of sexual abuse, analytics have warned that there will be a relapse, especially from women, during the coming elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It is not possible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) last attempt to a FBI investigation will be enough to calm up angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrating "November comes!" scanned when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the Court Committee chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"The people say it was already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female electors in the pre-locations and younger electors, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, even though they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford’s public testimony with accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analytists suggested that a rejection could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused touch for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh come through, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have handled it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be shared over who to believe in the Cologne Water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witnesses, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s witness, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those from at least another charger, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate's Court Committee during the ed last week that Kavanaugh attacked her violently at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her sex bodies while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruption, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the intention behind Inruption is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is totally up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data".
The idea of Inruption, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available at the Inrude website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the high edge over one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruption's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an impressive vote in the debate on network neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inruption, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and head of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic in front of this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktora cross during the first World War
The only priest in the English Church that was rewarded with a Victoria cross during the first world war is now celebrated in its home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a prick shooter four days later and never heard that he had been awarded the most prestigious price of the British military.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren under a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vand, said that it was "brillian symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vand led its batalion on 29 September 1918 over Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a very thick feather and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the shot line and led with "great braveness" line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German prick shooter on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble toward."
He and his brother Dr. James Vandn also put down a crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he knew very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a genuine hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after keeping up to the early morning hours to watch the match.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed child program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they were forced to switch to child program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice CEO for marketing and communication when he was asked about the shipment.
"Greta pig, yes."
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution to the reprise," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change was upset by many.
We tried to deal with it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually a state question.
I can promise that it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we usually do. We took water over our head in our effort to satisfy the fans.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" because of sexuality
The Olympic dyker Tom Daley says to feel underwhelmed his companions during his growing up because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that he wasn't like anybody else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about gaining OS after being parent.
The popular show's regular program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months free because of disease.
During his one-time appearance in the first Lavers program, Daley tells him how he felt "less worth" than others during his growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling me different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "nobody," he said, so he didn't deceive everyone when they eventually found out of his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bronze Mediator has become a high-profiled prosecutor for HBT rights and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was saying because he felt he'd have been lucky to live open without limitations and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-fold world champion said that his love in a man - the American film maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as 14-year-old and his father died by cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about gaining gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic Gold Medal.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got his tickets to Olympic Games in London 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be able to sit on the front line of Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally acknowledged that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to show before a home public on an Olympic scene, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the OS and still gave him shakings.
Desert Island Discs are sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson from form on the bank during Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will fight records on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the shape to avoid an accidental milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four balls and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting heajaclack and practicing his game in the hope of having a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drives, not even on the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough banana at Le Golf National, where the long rupee often punishes hard.
It is not just the banana that shocks, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson meets the master Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novel Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, which are 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches, have joined in the beginning, Mickelson's match may be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a klapp on his back and put his arm about me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a familiar and has added so much to these laws during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two matches.
I thought he'd be able to do more, but now it's what it is, and we'll be pleased with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said his presence brought other quality teams.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, silly, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership could soon be a memorial only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singers in Ryder Cup can quickly change to an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the management of Seven Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Man reminds you that we led greatly on Valderrama, we led great on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and nap," said Bjorn (on photo) after having seen the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and all in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, we'll give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that's where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
The bear was satisfied with the performance of its players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never do this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges are waiting.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that apply, and it's a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is fully tested.
This is the message you need to communicate to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to go and get out the best of himself."
In contrast to Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as losers when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediaries.
We made our position and put the guys that we wanted to create, you know, a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans at the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about their single choices.
Germany's new warships are re-launched
The latest fregate of the German fleet would have been sealed in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war's time, but it will not be sealed until at least next year due to wrong systems and high costs, reported local media.
Introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship for the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, has now been suspended to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military speaker.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were deceased for the ambitious project.
The four ships in Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fregates.
They will contain a powerful canon, a range of air weather and sea target missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest fregates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the banbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already old when they are in operation, says Die Zeit.
The deadly F125 freight created headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss warf in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the retour, but German media indicated a number of important "smooth and machine products" which made the warship worthless if used on a battle mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the ability of the marine to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the whole project's price note - including training of crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to be EUR 3.1 billion in defence (3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the initial stage.
Problems affecting the most recent fregates are particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that Germany’s sea power decreases.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "starts to have a lack of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, since old ships are discontinued but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the marine.
National Trust Thief Lights for the Secret Life of the Fladdle Mice
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish High Countries aims to reveal how flatter mice uses the landscape in its hunting for food.
We hope that the results will throw new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to the management of future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwergpistrill as well as brown borrowers and Daubenton fladdermöss at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track flater mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of fladder mice sounds and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Health Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of life environment that are most important for the fladder mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will contribute to determining the benefits of lifestyle management work, such as the creation of widows and the best way to maintain forest fields for flater mice and other related species.
Flattermus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects bone and loss of living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aeroplanes and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and cave tax attacks.
In fact, fladdermouse isn't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the change.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flater mice seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated fladdermus reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland ten fladdermus species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for flatter mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, plenty of veteran trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is a lot about fladdermice that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flatter mice before carrying out maintenance in properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eliminate a whole population.
Flattermice is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bone.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flatter mice and too many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects violation while his lawyers threaten to vote the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the assault prosecutors against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raising an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) dismissed the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after reporting the requirements.
"New no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner of the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldos lawyers are prepared to vote Der Spiegel on claims, which they have called "a unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed event is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the claimed event and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" fault of the "sist percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "red of recompensation" and was concerned about "becoming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the reconciliation because she continues to traumatize by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the claimed attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will always repent" to lose car manufacturers
Great Britain would "return it forever" if they lost their status as a world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "angry" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, they will suspend production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border could result in loss of jobs in the event that no contract is concluded.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO on Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini-installation in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem concerns what car manufacturers say is risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without discontinuation.
Toyota's production line is driven on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from both the United Kingdom and the EU's suppliers for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of consumption in stocks on its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and of which production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid control at the border".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success to be appreciated at present, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The statements from not just Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is leader of the Unite Facks Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein could be "shot in another week" while the fight against the highest court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues," said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work with the special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacles to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the vice-President of Justice, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has given fuel to Washington's crows for months.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing cancellation equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of disposing the president through the 25th supplement of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday he went to the White House, and reported that he would go away.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, which will be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee interrogations where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual independence, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "A date for it has not been established, it may happen this week, or a post-closure with a week in view of all other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would argue that statement: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disappointment against TV reports such as "play for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him," she said and added without quoting evidence, "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, perhaps the president showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland with regard to concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland NHS to express the gratitude of the country and the desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit have continued, before decisions that are expected to come in autumn.
However, the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing acute surgery after he has been affected by main injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie undergone an acute surgery after being affected by a major injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee States Head Trainer Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sidebar and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the side line before he was placed on a bar for further evaluation.
A representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/umfang of damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five taks on Saturday before leaving the match, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 taks.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless, according to the new plans of the Tory Party
The action will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers should pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money should be used to help homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises on housing at more affordable prices and aiming at high income.
The increase in stamp tax will be removed from individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a push to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in leisure housing and housing purchased for rent. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will take up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13% of the newly built property in London is purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many well-bearing areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become spice cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will be just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first dwelling.
He accused large construction companies to keep the prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to resign from allowances on housing with affordable prices to solve the "tough living situation of Britain."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a magnificent enough proposals for housing reforms, including rental ceiling and an end to breakdowns without the lease of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities a greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says, "Last year I said that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who are not living in Britain, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as too hard-working inhabitants of our country.
The dream of ownership of their dwelling has become just a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland trainer.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently located on third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after letting St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B country team and that was all," says Ross to BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked much at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross' representatives as trainers for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about pursuing such established names in such a large club. He has previously refused to offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now, I consider success based on the answer to the question, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been trainer for three years, after a period of assisting trainers in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Heart's trainer team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from the deposition to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close downwards to winners of the mastership title the season thereafter.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he recalls and refers to when he took the command over Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live well on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing may be hard.
It's a lot you have to get through every week.
It's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to train and now I do it. I feel better than I've ever done throughout my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s heat belt has resulted in increased revenue for the country’s fighting pubars, but the restaurant chains have suffered greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the company consultative company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continue the beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the VM longer than expected meant that we could see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up with 2.8%. However, the restorations had even greater difficulties.
The reduction in the sales of restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubars and bars offering mainly drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had fallen.
Pubars offering food were also difficult in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The impact of managed pubs and bars increased the sale of drinks by 6.6% that month, and the food sale decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment professional RSM says: "These results are a continued trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports events are still the most important factors in the sale on the large kitchen market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer couldn't have come more unpleasant for companies driven by food sales. The time can show about the more moderate temperatures we have had in August gives a well-needed respit."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that there are now fewer new brands.
The industry seller Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub-bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses information on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and is a established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
A study shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 students at the university and university shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has increased anxiety that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of the students said they had a "head account" that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media as they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20 000 students at the college and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has caused anxiety because it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of the students reported that they have a cleaned "head account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.

According to the study, conducted by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says, "It is anxiety that so many teenagers are attracted to create sites on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the idrotts" in the Board of the Scottish Athletics, the Scottish Freedom Association
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised freeid rats, and the President Ian Beattie describes the choice as an outstanding opportunity for those leading sports to benefit from her broad experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I want to be a voice for the sports and I hope I can contribute and help to lead the sports in Scotland."
The Americans, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlantic 1996, have a total of four Olympic Gold and are now expert commentator at BBC. He lost the ability to walk after a mini-strake.
He writes on Twitter, "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time was given to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cereals parts the Internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused differences in opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to note the launch of what is said to be the first silent portable breast pump of the world, the Consumer Technology Company Elvie has released a music video inspired advertising film with humorist appropriations to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump giving mothers that pump breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a hip-filled lady with cows to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a juvenile, but a tits."
The refraction continues: "Pump out, pump out, I eat the babys, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just as we need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," says one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to make advertising for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What reality-from-reaching advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks that the song is "hysterical fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have got one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genial product," says someone.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertising film that turns to mothers who pump (often on the workplace or on the toilet) and feels like 'cosor'."
This is not a movie that shouts or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they all have danced with the discrete pump in the field.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be weared discreetly in a breast-feeding hook, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babys and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is part-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says, "Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By draging a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertainable and easily recognisable manner showing the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headings.
During the London fashion week, a two-childer mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved in silence to a tent camp near the border of Texas
The number of free migrant children has shot at the height even though the number of persons crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the harsh retoric and hard policy introduced by the Trump Government made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fears to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at stake by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a higher official of the immigration and customs authority, witnessed to the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for referral to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by criminal prosecutors since then.
"First 80% of the individuals who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecution these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's matters faster, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be in court within a month of their depriving freedom, rather than after 60 days, which were practiced, according to the staff of the preliminary proceedings.
Many of them are present to video link rather than personally to bring their appeal for legal status before a immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom the more likely it is that they are suffering from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the settlements and reports from the system in recent months.
Prosecutors say that anxiety is rising at larger installations such as Tornillo, where evidence that a child has it more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the city of tents without enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and take a goodbye to friends, many may worse the traumas that are already violated.
Syria requires American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian grounds, under the presumption of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and conditionlessly," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem pointed out that "the war against the terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions left their homes.
He said that the Damaskus government would continue to "fight this sacred kind until we have released all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily trained and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the wary country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "wise Western countries" to "spread irrational fear" that allows refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a pure humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomas say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a great attack on Russian Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "decisive deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed to jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusrafront, which will be "extinguished".
The United Nations Senior Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition will soon be gathered to make a draft postwar constitution for Syria and the path for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be restricted to "the review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against involvement.
Why Donald Trump will win a reselection
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the reselection of 2020 unless his presidentship was completed in the past by the right of law and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever!"
At present, there are no signs that the watchers have tired.
Since 2014, the watch figures at the best time have been more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and are almost three times so high, 1.6 million, at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of broadcasting, which is an increase from 1.7 million for four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during large news evenings.
"This is like a fire to which people are attracted, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a monthly co-mediate author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club." She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, in contrast to everything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the welfare of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it is in addition to being an informed citizen when suddenly you have seated and looked for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of struts for $15,000 ("a plate filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomi.
I'll never even look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he does to make it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump-committee's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (may fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I talked to the TV producer Mr Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in the north of Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and oiled inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not wear, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be set before the Senate's Legal Committee and the Supreme Court's future was in the wake cabbage.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs earlier and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the evenest race ever before the mid-year selection
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congress District receives plenty of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a congress district that has made two members now compete about the same place.
This recently resigned pre-district district in Pittsburg is represented by the Democrats Conor Lamb, who got its place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts had been constitutionally modified to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign financing dispute between the economic sections of the largest parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republic of Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button gain in a widely monitored special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a Republican over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain propulsion.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for China support but backed then
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the participants rejected the Trump Organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the US Foreign Ministry decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "new decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said the ministerial speaker Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. assistance in 2017, including drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck hard against the Central American country with its high unemployment and mortal statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In the middle of September, however, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in the mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the presidential administration, said the diplomates.
And the three American messengers returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker of John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, of which two diplomates, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next unavoidable step may be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's claimed crime in judicial matters, for which there is now considerable evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to control its investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the Congress would change the majority, Trump will be held responsible for that congregation just when he prepares himself for reconciling the election, and perhaps finally for a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, so neither his colleagues in Europe.
We must all meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the struggle can be extended.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put an ice coup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood bath that followed.
History surrounds such decisive events, and the immobile promarch of democracy is either hurried on or braked.
The Americans are now faced with several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives vice-president Rod Rosenstein, the man who checks what's going to happen with Mueller's investigation, kicked?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to play the president in secret last year and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times report does not match.
"How should we answer if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may join the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote at a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jews and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residency.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and 60 years later, she sent me away to turn the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hackaros.
With that as heritage, how could I be other than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that the victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish battle against Villarreal that ended unequivocally before the month will put them in a strong position to qualify themselves from Group G in Europe League.
A crusade prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2- battle against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater successes.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good law," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the match in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
We may have been able to get it in the end, but in the whole, there was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half-game, and we came back in the second half-game and were the better team.
On Thursday, there will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troop is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have great importance for the cost.
Help your economic adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or a self-surance with own resources, if you have advice.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a medical authority so that you can designate a trusted person who monitors your medical care and ensures that the nurses follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacity.
Don't forget the details: Imagine you have an older parent who comes into an acute medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you, then, be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are it?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."
You'll be shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns when he walked home from an outnight.
The victim, in the age of 40, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "one-time event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life threatening, and the police urge witnesses to hear themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia in Friday. It reports officials. The death figure is expected to rise.
Communications are exposed, and rescue staff have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala management area, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter. The earthquake measured 7,5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, which are on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main place of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a small bucket on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to 379 800 persons in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40-year anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamin attacked.
Donggla is a management area stretching more than 300 km from the northwest Sulawesis coast.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated to 299 200 persons in 2017.
The pillars of the province of Central Sulawesis are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the coastal region of Donggla.
Nickelgrowing is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami who killed nine people suffered the western Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacifish seismic fire ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale hit south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, and triggered a tsunami that attacked the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the main place of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck against one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to 10 meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that razed together.
2018: Great earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily sealed.
Sarah Palins elder son arrested for violence at home
Track Palin, older son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, which is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspicion of violence at home, to have put in a notification of violence at home and to have opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female familiar who tried to call the police and notify the alleged crimes.
Palin sits in the Mat-Su court and is held against the 500 dollar deposit to be paid if the suspect violation of the debt conditions, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday and explained himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected for three cases of less serious crimes under class A, which means that he can get prison for up to one year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crimes under class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's charged for crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the claimed crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016 he was accused of violence at home, of having been in the notification of violence in the home and for the possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him to have hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, which originates from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are downwards, and the death figures are expected to rise in the nearest days.
The earthquake hit right outside the central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Films showing when it hits are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunamin attacked the coast.
Federal prosecutors incur a rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are in charge of the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the Terror Attestation in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental car from the construction and accommodation chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway on the bottom of Manhattan. He kicked pedestrians and bicycles in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death judgment, the chargers must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body injury, according to the intention of death penalty sent in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of accusation may mean a death judgment, according to the judicial act.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murders to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in targets of organised crime, as well as mistreatment and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide planning and purpose", said the accusators, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "awesome, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's Southern District hasn't accused of a target of death penalty for a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was arrested for murder of two drug lawyers, but eventually sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal trial in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for stamping to spionship for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg was both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekian citizens, showed, according to the judicial documents, a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the case, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, the police told me.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 points of accusation in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "verily disappointed" on the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue death penalty instead of joining lifetime prison without the possibility of contingent release if the accused person admits guilty only extends trauma that these events have caused to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to penalize death penalty.
Member of Parliament of Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "recognize the hotness" of the EU sceptics when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary members suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the march in Birmingham, the conservative Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom should have already "passed out" if Nigel Farage had been Minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces in bringing the deeply shared attachers to reconciliation has been worsened by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under the attack of Brexitan trailers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her alliance has insisted that she should press on and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the rebate, and force EU shippers and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "coos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihole that he wanted to "spole Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the root, we would have been out at this time," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must spoil the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said, "We have not fought World War to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the claims that the general opinion would have been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to remain is absolutely false."
The Brexitan trailer Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also joined the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Premier Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers Agreement is impopular to the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular in the party and with our electoral workers who are out of the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Put off the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Premier Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that the politicians must be "recognized" if they would fail the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, "We won't let you get away with it."
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is near to fail Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-controlling and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU followers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists whispered with paths with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched in the weekend.
The Labour parliamentaris Lord Adonis from the Super House rejected the conservatives for security problems they attacked with a party app when the conference opened.
"These people say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for freectionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" about applying to the president's post
The U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take herself a "ordinary thoughts about applying to the presidential post" after the elections in November.
The newspaper Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a city house meeting in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now puts up for the revelation in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was the assistant of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been subject to speculations that she may take on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
Someone asked her if she planned to make a candidate for the president's post.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our violent government. It means a woman at the top.
A person arrested for the death shooting of the basket player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting of the LSU basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a movie of the shooting on Friday to get help to identify a man viewed on the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot damaged in his head and finally died of this," said the Polish Chief Murphy J. Paul for the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and acknowledged that he had been on the site and had a weapon, and he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was brought to the arrest at the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starts last season, and cut in 17,4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returnes per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after the team order gave him profit over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost hanged out Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position during the first two warves, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went then first and let Hamilton run in the back of the club, which should have been decisive.
Mercedesen went in on a ship later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver absently left the inside free with the risk of offering place after a double draw to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first yard on his 21th anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and kept in the deck to reach a quick goal and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the decoration of the 44th floor but failed to increase the pace during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkone went up in the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekends and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," said Hamilton.
Correctly bad body language
President Donald Trump rejected Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintained that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to judges of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the witness from Ford in front of the Senate's Legal Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elake, unclean and liar."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, bad, uncovered and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks, and they say, "No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Remember?
Have you softened, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you decked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidentially as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to have matched the president, who commented this on Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of three women's sexual offences, and he indicated that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control," said the President according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars soned Friday loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-target management through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie dismissed the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard kvitted Dundee before two cases from Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's law, who came back and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goals came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave help when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who kvitted at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he did his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again kvitted with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with the fifth halfway of his law through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his five last matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Flight leaders died for hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is now sheltered as a hero after deceasing when he ensured that a plane of hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy afterscalves continue to plague the area and many are fast in the bread of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild sweating control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the startway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would rash.
He died later in a hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpapan on the Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
We are crushed over hearing this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death figure can increase to more than a thousand people. The country's disaster aid authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies remaining in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker of the Authority.
Up to six feet high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute a ambulance comes with dead bodies.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
The president of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was previously suffered by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane scratch in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagune
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagune in Micronesia, Pacific, now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been expelled from the falling planet and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions of more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crews after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chuuk islands.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been brought to hospitals.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and how the event progress looked.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was swallowing by the landing path.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wheat through mid - deep water to the emergency exits of the descending planet.
He said that the cabin crew was paniced and shouted, and that he had a smaller shell damage.
The American fleet said that seafarers working near the development of a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a blowing boat to drive people in land before the planet fell in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analytics draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor page ended on Saturday in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The American Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of notification analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to punch the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received localisation information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chamber's mobile phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "laughing, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, conversations and contact information from his phone.
"He swallowed her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to begin its final performance on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far away from its origin in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a swing in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?
A child girl in New York matches a couple because of a breakdown after a "racist" text message
A kid girl in New York matches a couple for discrimination after she got a wrong-sended text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again."
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the atmosphere with "expression".
Two-children's mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed a fear when she understood that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEY NOT A SWARD IGEN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "like to courage", and gave Maurice kick, and claimed that their former child girl, who was afro-American, had done a bad job and, instead, she expected a philipine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is right to the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She demands compensation in the size scheme $350 per day for the job she was first employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only right thing was to finish the work of Giselle Maurice, and they were worried that they couldn't trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racialists," said husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you had been uninjured against, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the atmosphere with "expression" and said that his wife would feed children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you get on such a person?
This is not particularly nicely done," added the Investment Bankir Plasco.
The legal process is still in progress, but the general opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the child book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60-year anniversary of the first edition was "bitterlift" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was proud of the silence of her final success.
"He was quite silent by himself, and not any scary person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds with something. You get proud of the child, even though it isn't one who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little like that.
Though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been driven to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that one did not expect her to be able," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was shut down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not threw or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to bring myself together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now sad the loss of his daughter, went on board on the planet together with the other passengers, who were completely unconscious of the difficult trial she passed through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sorging women set up postal cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their associates because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that can be called for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to need as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells her son was a promised coke that had an infecting smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile shouted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sister when he had killed him in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm still worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to make people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphrey, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner since 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the children opened his Christmas claps, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard stroke for them, but they have to get through it. "It breaks up a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to fight further."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the game when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we were able to achieve something similar to what he asked for - a time-limited investigation - we might have a little consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "splitted" because of deeply rotted parties' differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their controversy depends entirely on the time.
The Mediterranean elections will take place in only five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be strongly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to have chosen to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where it is now sitting 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow vice president Mike Pence to break the death situation and confirm his invasion in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean departures "sjunks" under Kim
The number of Northern Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoting data from the South Korean Reconciliation Ministry, says that 1 127 people jumped from last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher charges to human smugglers, are important reasons.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
The majority of the hops from North Korea were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hardly monitored demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the hopes as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is still technically in war with each other, has been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for discussions focusing on the fixed-run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American penalties for the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not unilaterally disarmament ourselves first," said Ri at a speech from the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help me think that if a woman had beaten so, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witnesses in front of the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations to have sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and at times he shouted almost and the voice stuck when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since it showed that he was partial to the disaster of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in front of the law of the Kingdom if he was elected, and if the Democrats were given a majority in the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's on now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Appeal Court of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that she, as a democrat, was concerned about which decisions Kavanaugh may be taken against the Health Insurance Act of Affordable Care Act or the abortion objective Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In its confirmation requests, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would amend certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not a situation for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she became angry, but had developed a technology that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she said to the person she spoke to, 'You maybe think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried of unscriptionable anger, was that I was taken into the force of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they're happy that they were able to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congress member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was captured with a non-married shop on a boat named Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason to not investigate the idea of setting up the presidential election itself.
"It wasn't a well-planned decision," she said with a smile to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snowit and the seven dwarfs."
Because she was late out, she was leaving with the money collection, and she promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get 2 million dollars together.
It was a project sentenced to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not initiate a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice was stuck.
"You could have thought I had had a nervous crash," says Schröder apro on the reactions of the press.
"You could have believed that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my grave stone?"
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Peking
The opening path in the trade war between the United States and China was eagle devastating. The war is far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
The United States President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing on important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important trip came in the week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion. In practice, half of all goods coming into the United States from China are customs charged.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time. Recently, fees of between five and ten percent on US goods for $60 billion were disappeared.
China has promised to match the United States' actions. The second largest economy of the world is probably not going to fall within overlookable time.
Being Washington backing means to bow for demand, but publicly crying for the United States would be too gentle to China's president Xi Jinping.
Experts, however, believe that if Peking plays its short right, the press from the US trade war can give a positive support to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependency of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in each country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the Median Center for New American Security.
Syria 'redo' for home refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary refugees and call for help to build up the country, which is ruined after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now being improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and survivors.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syria have flew the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe ended with the victory in Ryder Cup, Paris
Team Europe has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the United States team with the final position 16.5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14,5 points required to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during the largest part of the tournament, ended in the water at the impact of the 16th hole pair of 3-way, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari glanced in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-5--0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked players of the European team, Thorbern Oread from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, which may have done its last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
This is about the team, and I am glad I could be helpful," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the Europe team.
He left the stavet pin to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in a single Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am raised to watch him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now results 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the whole weekend with finding fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's defeating performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
It was time this morning when we increased the temperature in Europe.
We took the asshole.
The hatred of Thomas.
He's a fantastic captain.
All his 12 players were really good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we go on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being Captain.
You're gonna have to bow and bow.
They played better than us."
Algae flowering: The holdings decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wild Commission shows a general reduction in concentrations of algae flower for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, uneven flowers are reported in the areas around the large communes of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algae flower stretches around 20 miles [20 km] of the coast, from north Pinellas to south Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles out of the sea outside the major municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Mean high concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough were high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the large communes Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
