Welsh administrators are worried about “looking like a fool ”
In some administrators, it is suggested that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Chamber).
The concerns have arisen because of plans to change the name of the Council to the Welsh Chamber.
In all classes, consultants are concerned that this could make them ridiculous.
One workman said that his class was worried that “the rims with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in goodness, twp means crazy and pwp means odor.
A council from the Plaid Cymra class said that the whole class was “inadequate ” and gave other suggestions for the name.
A well - being consultant said that his group had “open mind ” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the words MWP and Muppet (fluon).
In this context, it can be seen that the well-being letter w is bored similarly as u in Icelandic.
The advice that is now working on a legal basis to present the change in names said: “The decision on all the names that are headed over the members of the Council will, of course, be with the members themselves. ”
The Law on Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the conclusions of public opinions that showed great support for calling the Council of the Welsh Chamber.
As regards the title of the administrators, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, welfare Congressors) chose, but MWP was most supported by the public in the research.
According to the news, managers now submit other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the President of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to submit an idea of the changes within a few weeks.
The first edition of the reforms will also include other changes to how the Board is working, including rules on the elimination of administrators and the organisation of the committee system.
Advocates will be able to pay a final vocabulary on their title when discussions about the premiere begin.
Macedonians are voting in the elections for the change of the country’s name
The chiefs will vote on Sunday on whether to change their name to the “Nordern Macedonia”.
This matter was voted in an attempt to resolve a decades of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of their neighbours in the north equals a requirement in its territory and has many times protested their applications for membership of the EU and Nato.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not regard the elections as valid.
However, supporters, including President Zoran Zaev, have said that the change of name is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and Nato.
St. Martin's Church Clock is in trouble with churches in Harlem
“ The older people I’ve spoken to said that earlier, the bar and church could be found on each side of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today there is no finding there. ”
He said that it was understandable that baths would fall down.
“The people have other ways to meet today,” he said.
“Bare are no longer the center of the neighborhood, where people are regularly gathering together. ”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money of sales will not be only as long as leaders are expected to “and sooner or later they will return to the beginning. ”
He added that possible churches would be replaced by a house full of people who would not help to save the following locations of the neighborhood.
“ The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white, ” he said, “and thus will hurry for these churches to be permanently closed, because most people who move in these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St Martin’s Church decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white metodesta congregation was disappeared.
A congregation of black ones who had worked in the neighborhood took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the guidance of John Howard Johnson, who had the intention to dismiss traders on 125th streets, Harlem’s main business gate, who sought to manage or provide them with positional increases.
The building was seriously damaged in 1939, but members of Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild it, and they also made the clock game.
Sera David Johnson, a son and a successor of Johnson, called the watch game pride “the watch of the poor people. ”
The specialist who played on July’s clock game called it another name: “Cultural treasure ” and“ unique historical musical device. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first watch game in the world on which a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin hadn't got anyone else in his place.
The past months, many architects and laborators have put their way to St. Martin, some of the leaders of the church and others of the Bishop.
The church council, supervised by the visit and appointed church leaders, wrote to the Bishop in July and declared its concerns that the Biccapadam would “are seeking to overcome the cost ” of the Church Council, even though it had not been part of the recruitment of the architects and the works sent by the Bishop.
Some visitors complained about the lack of transparency of the half of the biscuits.
A chief hurts 13 - year - old boy who threw a mood in California
According to the authorities, a throat was attacked on a 13 - year - old boy and hurt him on Saturday when the boy was dying after a mum in California on the first day of the mood hunting period.
The attack was just about seven in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been sleeping with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then run over together with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first, he thought that this was just excited about getting humbled, and then “he became aware that the boy cried“ I was bited!
I was bited!"
All his bones were ripped up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out all of them to come up from the water: “There is a hail in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was moved with a helicopter to the Rady-Barn Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously hurt.
It is not known what kind of hail the boy attacked.
Larry Giles, head of the coastal guards, said at a media conference that a hail had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of hail.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed coastal access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, in research and safety sense.
Giles said that more than 135 different types of hails were in the area, but most of them do not think dangerous.
Sainsbury’s with a plan for cultivating the flavouring market in Britain
Sainsbury’s is going to engage in Boots, Superdrug, and Debenham’s business center with specialized assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the Snow products of Britain, which is worth 2,8 billion pounds and grows increasingly during the sale of fashion and home products. The larger Snowdrops will be tested in the 11 stores all over the country and will be installed in more stores next year.
Incorporation is part of a major marketed route to use a hill lock that was previously new from TVs, microwaves, and homewars.
Sainsbury’s claim is to double its selection in up to 3,000 product types, including lipmarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have an increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the store like Boots.
The sale is also intended to be resaled at its Boutique product selection so that the majority of the goods are road-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance Shop sales store will test in the two Sainsbury shops, the first one opened in Croydon in South London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Networking and increased tendency of consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in the local shops means that large - marketed needs to make more efforts to get people to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores would be more and more similar to the shopping centres when the trade chain is trying to fight against the low - goods store Aldi and Lidl with more services and other lips than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also presented the history of the number of Habitat camps since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, this has increased sales and made the purchase more viable.
The first attempt of the shop to live up to its precious product and product divisions failed to work well.
Sainsbury’s tested collaboration with Boots around 2000, and then, because of a disagreement on how to share the sale of medicinal products in the large markets.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury’s sales of its 281 pharmaceutical transactions to Celesio, the Lloyds drug traders’ owner, was 125 million pounds before three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play in these programmes by adding a lot of luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury’s Market, said: “We have changed our looks on our beauty equipment to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in special training for employees who will be provided for advice.
Our choice of brands is designed to meet all the needs. The wholesome environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting smart shopping that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones “released ” after Holly Willoughby quit 11 million pounds of a contract
Peter Jones, the star from the factors of Dragon Den, became “experienced” after the television sensor Holly Willoughby ceased 11 million pounds of agreement with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby's got no time for their home and accompanying goods, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the globe of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37 - year - old study of this Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the Star of Dragons’ Den, with the pain of stopping participation in a popular lifestyle company in the last hour to focus on new and prosperous contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Recognitions say Jones has been “experienced ” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at its headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television woman popularly admitted that she had not enough time for the Truly trade mark for the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow lips, and was intended to double the property of Willoughby, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she was going to draw herself out of Truly Fly Jones from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A reporter said: “Truly was the longest in Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future project that would take her the next two decades.
Her decision to stop all of them was completely in open shield.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line could be marketed.
There's a full stock of lips in Marlow's headquarters ready to go to sale."
Experts believe that this Morning, including the most popular British stars, can cost millions of the company because of large lorries, from baskets and kerts to clothes and household goods, and possibly may cause further delays in the sale of the carriage line.
This could also mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, a three - child mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been kind Jones and Tora Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly and Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the president of March.
The couples spend their summer vacation together with Jones at 40 percent in the Baldwin company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S lips and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV director I'm a Celebrity.
A reporter close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to tell anything about his business. ”
Difficult discussions “and then we became in love”
He ran with the criticism that he received from the media, for saying something that many would think inappropriate for President, and for being so positive to the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said that he was a reporter's voice.
"I haven't left anything."
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a great step towards the nuclear weapon of North Korea.
However, discussions on the submission of nuclear weapons have been stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief North Korean embassy, said to international leaders of the General Assembly S.D. on Saturday that the north had not received an appropriate response from the United States at the first steps of North Korea to nuclear weapons.
Instead, he said that the United States continued up to customers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his meeting talk.
“We are greatly meeting with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people had lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve Kim’s relationship have resulted in positive flammatory tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also had an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a tricky scene, only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing out the population in front of themselves.
Flood bubbles and earthquake in Indonesia cause great damage on the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international parliamentary organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee their homes, the emergency situation was not declared, but this is the prerequisite for international organizations to have help.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made clear that they are not going to ask for aid from international organizations, so that this is difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children’s Association is compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure when foreign assistants can have a job in the area.
Mr Sutopo, speaker of the country’s disaster agency, said that Indonesian leaders were appreciating the situation in Pala to see whether international conventions should be allowed to assist in the helping work.
With regard to how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the land is sadly badly prepared to defend natural powers.
Flood waves have been built in Aceh, but they are rare at other coastal lines.
It seems that the fluid fluids in Palu have still increased in a human case, even if the warning was issued.
Even in the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia may be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A sickship that has been lying at a port in Lombok for the victims of the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, which will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the most important element of his electoral journey to re-establish the degraded transport of Indonesia and has put a lot of money in the way and in the railways.
However, a lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to cope with persistent tension between religious groups in Indonesia, since members of the Muslim majority have established a more persistent religious policy.
Over 1,000 people died, and twenty thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims struggled on the streets with sweats, bows, stimulations, and other primary weapons.

The support of the British Chamber of Cromwell is the latest memories accused of "restoring history"
The prohibition of the distinguishment would be poisonous justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitions of the Purites of so many cultural and religious studios of England.
The Cromwell company, however, said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was "the poor" and "the attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about removing a shortage, it was inevitable that the shortage of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Hall would be the fight.
The spirit of the English civil war against the symbols of culture was neither order nor implementation of Cromwells.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his predecessor Thomas’s actions in the preceding century.
The glorious shortage of Cromwell, according to Sir William Thorneycroft, is at the mark of the 19th century, and is part of a man’s history that many think still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps in the late 19th century rather than today, as a guardian of the assembly against external pressure, in his case of the kingdom.
There is still a great deal of historical disputes about the fact that this description is at all right.
However, the conflicts that were in the middle of the 17th century have developed our nation’s evolution and that Cromwell is a known person representing one side of the war.
It is worth keeping and remembering his achievement as the Protector of the kingdom."
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
Swan attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on a market in the southwest of China, according to news from the city.
The man named only with his surname “Yuan ” was deceased with a broken artery and covered blood near a pig on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou, according to reports from South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pigs are prepared to inject vaccines into pigs in the pigs of May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai region, China.
According to this, he had traveled with his uncle from the neighborhood Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the uncle found him dead and saw that the door in the nearby pigs were open.
He said that in the staircase, it would have been a great glow with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that the 250 kg salmon had killed the farmer.
“ My uncle’s feet were bloody and injured, ” said the uncle, with the aftername “Wu, ” with the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording from a security camera showed Yuan to come on the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found some hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not in possession of Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked in so that it did not attack anyone else while police collected evidence on the scene.
According to news, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market have talks about the improvements for his death.
There are recorded examples that pigs have attacked people, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig and her husband attacked their village in Massachusetts and hurt the man seriously.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pigs climbed a welfare farmer to a dragon until his wife fell off the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten from his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba at CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood flavors can raise attacks.
“ They're just playing.
They like to cry and be curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnant of Rosa brings great results over the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the strength of Rosa’s bulb decreases as it passes over the cooler sea at the northern coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will have a great result that could cause floods in the northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a mollusk in class 1, with a wind strength of up to 136 km a hour, at 5 o’clock at the eastern beach hour on Sunday, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is estimated to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it will go east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Shaken on Monday, as a hot storm will therefore follow a huge heatable trawl to the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will follow up to 25 cm of output in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the heating trap will be mixed with the lowness that approaches and forms great and widespread evacuation across the southwest of the next days.
Locally 2.5 to 10 cm descendants may cause dangerous sudden floods, soil movement and possible steps in the desert.
A high heating tract will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of output at an hour in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
There are up to 5 to 10 cm of output at some places in the southwest, especially in the largest Arizona county.
There is a possibility of suddenly disturbing conditions due to the distribution of heatable rains.
People are strongly advised to get out of the wilderness when there is a risk of heating.
Heavy rain can transform the throat to a fluid, and thunderstorms can lead to a storm and a weather of weather.
The nearby landscape will produce local decay in certain areas at the southern Californien coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of output that could cause a small movement of soil and neck on roads.
This is the first source of the region during the rain period.
Some scattered heaters will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the result is spread over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great result will spread over four neighborhoods on Tuesday and end Wednesday.
In the United States, there can be considerable temperature changes in October everywhere, as the northern region is cooling, but it is preferable that the temperature continues somewhat.
Sometimes this can cause a high temperature over short lengths of roads.
See a very fine example of a great difference in temperature in the Mediterranean States on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degrees of heat difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and disperse.
It is expected that a large part of the Central and Eastern United States will warm the beginning of October with a temperature of about 25 degrees or more from the south sides to the northeastern countries.
It could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast indicates that there is a high risk of temperature above average for the eastern United States in the first part of October.
Over 20 million people were watching hearings on Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people looked at the exciting witness to Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge, on Tuesday and the witness of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual crimes that were supposed to have occurred in the 1990 ’ s.
At the same time, the political patting position continued, and television stations interrupted a regular agenda to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona’s Senator, presented a radio to enable the FBI to investigate the accusations for one week.
Ford told the Board of Appeal that she was sure that Kavanaugh had drowned her and tried to disclear her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said emotionally that he was sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people viewed the case than the 20,4 million Nielsen told that they had been watched on Friday.
The company measured an average view of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television channels.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring the views of people in offices.
To put this into a context, this audience group is similar to the size of the football or the Oscar’s Award Award.
According to Nielsen, most of them looked at the hearings that took the whole day, at the Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. The views of the channels have faithfully supported the name Kavanaugh.
ABC was on the second seat of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Intention remained great after the trial.
Flake was the centre of the play on Friday.
After publishing an announcement of the office of this senator of the Republika class that Kavanaugh would choose to benefit CNN and CBS pictures of when Protestants called to him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the elevator to attend a meeting with the Court Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shortly raining over him in a direct shipment at CNN.
One woman said, “I stand right here before you.”
“ Do you think he is telling the people the truth? ”
People said to him: “You have power while so many women stand unpowered. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before the lifting door closed, he said that he would speak more at the committee’s meeting.
The Capal and Television Stations were all directly broadcasted later when the Judgment Committee decided whether Kavanaugh should send on to the Elders’ Board’s elections.
Flake said he would only do that if the FBI examined the accusations against the designated ones next week, but the minority of democrats has encouraged it.
In part, Flake became convinced after conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, the Deputy Deputy Minister of Democrats.
Flake took his decision after conversation with Coon and some other elders.
Flake’s votes were made because it was evident that the rebellion had not enough voting to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump's been authorized to investigate the FBI on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
May, Secretary-General of the United Kingdom, accused critics of being "in a political game" for Brexit

The authorities wanted to thank the special police officer in Louisiana, the police's criminal investigation office, the Southern University university police and the civilians in the area for the help of the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, president of LSU sport, thanked the lawyers for “their zealousness and looking for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The high - grown two - metre superior grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketballs for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points in average and took 2.6 results for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, basketball coach trainer LSU, said on Friday morning that the team was “trusted ” and“ in an attack ” because of Wayde’s death.
“ This is something you constantly worry about, ” said Wade.
Mount Fire spoils ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl fire mountain has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The Central Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the fire mountain after an increase in activity, and 183 cases of gas and ash release were recorded over a 24 - hour period.
The center was watched with a titring and shield from the fire mountain.
Societal media pictures showed a thin song of ashes on car trailers in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have noticed an increased activity in the fire mountain, 72 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since earthquake was up to 7.1 on Richter, raging across the central Mexico in September 2017.
The Mount of Fire, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police at Congress with Catalonian Separation just before birthday independent voting
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants took part in the police, and thousands took part in protests on the first birthday of the contested elections in Catalonia to describe autonomy.
A group of mask - dressed separation teams grew an ovarian cop and threw powder painting that formed dark dust clouds on the street, which were usually full of travelers.
Controversial conflicts also broke out later on the day, and the police used balls to keep struggles.
“ We don’t forget and forgive ” for a few hours while their opponents cried against, “Long life is Spain. ”
Fourteen, according to the local media, needed reconciliation for minor damage that they experienced in the protests.
A great excitement continues in the autonomous region one year after the 1 October national voting appropriation was sentenced illegally by the authorities of Madrid, but was delighted by the Catholic separation.
The majority of the voters chose independentness, but the participant was poor, since most of those who were opposed ignored the choices.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were disappeared in the past when police tried to stop the elections of elections across the region, which resulted in a conflict.
In order to prevent protests to support the country’s police, the independent groups had stayed out of the night on Friday.
The contradictory process took place, but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrical operator, participated in protesting divorce with his wife, saying that he was no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy of choosing, but now we sit firmly," he said.
In spite of the need for but little victory in the last December, independent classes of Catalonia have been difficult to keep a vacuum this year, since many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in awaiting courts due to their role in organising the voting and independent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old engineer who took the protests to support the police on his phone, said that politicians both of them had encouraged the dispute.
“ The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who have been imprisoned and prayed for a court since late last year, announced that he would offer himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My proposal in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return in the field of democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government use,” he said.

Contaminate scores in 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
First Dolly Menga guaranteed victory of Livingston
Lead Livingston, who came from the lower department, came to the Rangers, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his other loss in 18 games as executive manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the prosperity difference, and Gary Holt's team is now in another seat with Hibernian.
Lin Gerrard has not yet worked on an outlet in the selection department of this playtime and has played against Hearts, which are eight points before in the top, next Sunday.
For that time, Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna at the European Department on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unquestioned in the division with six victories, and Holt’s principal trainer has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller for the last month.
Livingston lost possibilities against bitsless guests
Holts should have been over long before it scored, but their direct supply caused Ranger’s great problems.
Scott Robinson got to break through, but hesitated in his attempt to cut, and Alan Lithgow then shot out after being walked through the defense to take a contradiction from Graig Halkett across the target.
The hosts let Rangers play before them in calmness, knowing that they could cause guests trouble at the right places.
And that was how the goal was scored.
Rangers had an extra problem, and Livingston worked to create target facilities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in association, which took on the shipment and cut from the middle of vital.
At that point Rangers had the ball, but the defense of residents was inevitable, and Liam Kelly, a target guard, had not had to do much.
Thus, this continued into the second half of the game, although Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the targetman of Rangers, and Lithgow shot from the mark after a visit from Livingston.
The spears stood constantly in the vital Livington, but were sparked from, and two demands for the vite pyramid - after the defense of Halkett against the warrior Glenn Middleton, and one after hand - were rejected.
“Good” in Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni scene
Fantastic performance and design for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood wonderful and continued to deal with all expectations on their way.
Their styles and teams have hardly changed anything since they came back to the top department, but Holt deserves a lot of commendation because they have been able to play together since their coming.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a coach was greatly good and led complete defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on tears all the time.
On the other hand, Ranger lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played long under expectations.
They did not finish their visits and only once opened the valley half of the homes so this should be awakening for Rangers who is now sitting in the middle department.
Erdogan gets mixed receivers in Cologne
It was smiled and bright in the sky on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and Germany’s leaders met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s district visit to Germany, which has the purpose of improving the relationship between the two nations of Nato.
There has been a disagreement between them for matters such as human rights, media freedom and Turkish entry into the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new great moscow.
The city is a home of most Turkish inhabitants outside the Turkish country itself.
The police used safety conditions to prevent 25,000 people from gathering before the Moscow, but a number of supporters were able in her neighborhood to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them of Kurds, also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to offer him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect the circumference of this visitor, but he is sheltered as a hero of some Turkish in Germany and hated as a ruler of one another.

The Fellibyl Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry area might benefit from)
It is uncommon that the temperature is over Arizona, but it is likely that this will occur early next week when the remainder of Rosa is crossing the southwest, with the risk of sudden floods.
The weather office of the country has already issued warnings for sudden floods before Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona and the south and west of Nevada, the southeastern part of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will go over Phoenix on Tuesday and come late on Monday.
On Twitter, the weather room in Phoenix said that only “twente bulbs have reached the strength to be classified as hot storms or lows shorter than 320 km away from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a barbecue within 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The last predictions from the country’s central centre predict 5 to 10 cm output, with a single output of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
The result is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other southwest areas, including the centre of the Climate Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of a single output up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of encountering sudden floods, the result of Rosa may be a blessing because large dryers are in the area.
Although a flood can cause great harm, some of this result will have a positive effect, where dryness is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Dry Surveillance, at least very much is dry in more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the nearest class," according to news from weather.com.
First, Rosa will reach the land of the Baja California shake in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still classed as a bulb with a maximum temperature of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling northwards at 19 km a hour.
The storm goes over the cooler sea in the Pacific, and then his power is decreasing.
So he is expected to land in Mexico as a heatable storm of afternoon on Monday or Monday Evening.
There is a potential for a high output in some regions of Mexico, with a considerable risk of floods.
“It is expected to come up from 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and in the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm output,” said a report from weather.com.
Rosa will then keep north over Mexico, as a hot storm, and then reach the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a heatwarm, and then continue through Arizona, and come to the southern part of Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“ The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her remains is a very high level of decline in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern part of the U.S. wilderness area, ” said the country’s eastern vicinity center.
It is expected that this result causes life - threatening sudden floods and ground movements in the deserts, as well as climbing at the end of the mountain.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “found the wickedness and anger ” of the Democratic Group
“Application for the support of the Kavanaugh judge is a voting that rejects the unfair and deceitful methods of the Democratic Group," said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia County.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “found the wickedness and the anger ” of the Democratic group through his entire designation process.
Kavanaugh was a witness to the sitting on Thursday, where he hardly defended the complaints from Christine Blasey Ford that he had put her sexually on her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusations to the committee.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans had seen the genius and the spirit and the courage of Kavanaugh at the day. ”
“Application for confirmation of the Kavanaugh judge is a voting that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a beautiful crystal as a public employee," he said to his group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president direct referred to the name of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of supporters of the rebellions in the mid - term season.
“ There are five weeks for one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't offer myself, but I really do it," he said.
“That is why I go a lot to fight for great suppliers. ”
Trump, then, claimed that democrats were working to “beat and stop. ”
The first key voting appropriation on the Gulf of the Chavanaugh Division should not be done later than on Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the republics in the interview with CNN.
Hundreds of men died after the earthquake and a flood wave in Indonesia, and likely that the number of dead will increase
At least 384 died, and many were swallowed away when a huge age was on the coast, when a great earthquake and a flooding ran over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six feet [6 m] high on the beach at sunset, plunged a number of people on the sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flood wave was formed after a earthquake of 7.5 points at Richter.
“ When the Flood Wayne began yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indian Emergency Institute, at the Jakarta Information Meeting.
“ The flood wave did not come alone, she drove cars, trees, houses, she screw on everything that was on the ground, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] fast before it went to the coast.
Some climb into a tree to escape the flood wave and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destructive buildings and stores, rotated and unused brewers and mosque surrounded water.
On Saturday, afterbiddens continued to cross the coastal city.
The range of earthquakes was seen in the area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Institution of Food and Technology, stated that the energy, which released bleeding in the large shield on Friday, had been approximately 200 times more than the atomic bomb falling on the city of Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city’s geographic location, which is at the end of a long and tiny flood, could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damage was “real ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had crashed.
The body of some victims was found stuck under a breakdown of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that human beings and possessions could be more than 300 km north of Pala along the coastal line, in a region called Donggala, which is close to the earthquake’s recording.
The communication “online and no information is being provided” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers were on the way to the area in question.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but could become much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Foundation was criticized by many on Saturday because they did not know that a flood bubble had swallowed in Palu, although official representatives said that the ages had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video that was published on social media, one could hear a cry from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Only minutes later, the river waves on the beach and carries buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood wave caused powerlessness that prevented contact with Pala and made it difficult for the authorities to organize auxiliary work.
The army has begun to send airplanes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the region still need food and other needs.
The city’s airports have only been opened for help and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit flight centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of dead is more than 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggella have reached a whole and acquaintance to the city of Palu, where they search for a cabinet in tent cities that were placed in the garden outside their offices. Destruction showed them on the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
“ People said they saw many houses destroyed, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Assistance groups have started difficult help work, but some have complained that abroad of helpers with great expertise would have been blocked from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocking and staff may only begin to occur if the accident area is exposed to an area of disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indian Red Cross.
When the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no statement has yet been made."
When the other night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the flood wave on Friday, friends and families of those who are still missing kept in the hope that their loved one of the miracles that thrilled the depressive stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was saved from a start.
On Sunday, helpers saved a woman who had been stuck under ruin for two days with her mother’s body alongside her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian pilot team, had been trained by two now missing pilots for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with a long experience in a flue, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hour after the news burst within the pilot group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message in desperation to the rivals who stayed in Pala and took part in the coastal festival.
His message, however, showed only gray signs, instead of blue.
“ I think it means that the message was not received, ” he said.

Canye West: The Rappar transforms his name into Ye
Canye West's rapper is going to change his name in Ye.
He reported the change in Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The being previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album coming out in June.
The change occurs in his participation in the Saturday Night Live factor, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace Ariana Grandi in the factors, but she dismissed “for emotional reasons, ” said the manufacturer of the factors.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortcoming of his current name.
“ I think that “ye ” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you, ” said West earlier in the year when he discussed the name of his plate with the Big Boy radio recorder.
“ So I am you, I am we, this are we.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to only Ye - to be just reflecting the good in us, the wicked, the confused, all.
The plate is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous raps who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former collaborator West, has also written his name with and without bandliness and cigars.
The president of Mexico is called not to use the army against the general civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised to never use army against general civilians, now the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of bloody vengeance students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Torg, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army any time to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful protest, killing up to 300 people at the time when the left - hand movements of students were shooting roots throughout the Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening more free public university.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study facilities have led young people to criminals.
The United States should double funding for satellite analysis
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of satellites, the United States should double the funding that it is in research in this area, says the inventor and the computer user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were reported after the various departments of the U.S. government published announcements of satellite analysis, even though the United States has no formal overall satellite analysis plan.
China, however, announced his previous plan: it is due to being in the first place in the new creation with a satellite analysis before 2030.
Lee said: “It would be a good start to double the funds that are going into satellite studies, since all other countries are so much longer after the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of satellite analysis.
The double amount of funds could double the chances that the next large discovery in the US will be made, says Lee to CNBC during this week’s interview.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major satellite companies in China.
He worked on a satellite system in the nineties at Carnegie Mellon University, who worked the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of the former technical competitions held by the US authorities, such as the defence engineering, and asked when the next race would be held to see the next initials.
Scientists in the United States often need much effort to gain strength from the government, says Lee.
“ It is not China that affects his main mind, but the company, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have managed to work on satellite universities in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their satellite studies.
“ I think those who have a grade of physicians should be allowed to stay automatically,” he said.
The Conference of China published its future strategy in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation and similar public organizations in the United States provide funds for people who work at the University Institutions, as well as for the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Ministry of Defence established a satellite centre, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House reported the creation of special committees on the satellite analysis.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As regards NSF, it invests more than 100 million dollars annually in satellite analysis studies.
At the same time, the United States legislation, which was intended to establish a satellite security advice, has not been established for several months.
Macedonians choose in a national voting party on whether to change the country’s name
The Macedonians chose a national vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the ‘Nordern Macedonia’ in a attempt to resolve decades of disputes with Greece, which have closed their application for membership of the European Union and Nato.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and claims that the name of their neighbours in the north equals the requirement of their territory and therefore refused to enter into Nato and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but national opposers claim that the change will undermine the majority of Macedonian inhabitants of slave origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts about reaching 50 percent of the minimum that is necessary for the voting procedure to be valid.
The question of the election procedure is: “Would you like to go to Nato and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a reasonable charge for Macedonia to be joined in alliances such as the EU and Nato, but the country is one of those who were created after the fall of Joegoslavia.
“ Today I came to choose the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means more secure life for us all,” said Olivera Georgiaevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, many congressors have said that they will follow it and bind it in law.
The change of name would need the approval of two thirds of the plenary.
The Cosing Committee said that no unusual report had been reported at 1 p.m. after lunch.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of participation in the last elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered votes paid their vote.
“ I came to choose because of my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old chief in the capital of Skopje.
The President of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid his voting in the national voting office in Macedonia on whether to change the country’s name, but it would pay its way into Nato and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small area and set up chairs before the tents built by those who would ignore the vote.
“We are delighted to Nato and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have a reward.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn something else like China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Mr Zaev says that Nató’s member will transfer the necessary amounts to Macedonia, where the proportion of unemployed is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the most long-term majority will agree, because more than 80 percent of the people in the country are EU and Nato,” said Zaev after paying their voting.
He said that an agreement would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Political Research Agency showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the national voting contribution, which is less than the minimum required.
Another survey from the Telma TV television channel showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to pay their voice on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said to yes.
So that national voting is considered to be valid, a measure of 50 percent plus one vote is required.
If the vote is not accepted, it may mean the first serious attack on the political policy of the Western government since its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all the defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton in Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad scene in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the visit, the Argentine supervisor received a transmission in the middle of the field.
He spread out of Brighton’s three defenders, and then went out to the open gate.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - clothes defenders.
He came out of one defenseman, and then he ran away from some other ones just at the vitatey Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English engine used the first touch within the vite to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the targeter Brighton, with a shot on the right side of the mark.
“ Aguero is on some football issues, ” said Pep Guardiola, executive of City, with newspapers.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he scored this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the selection game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero was sent far in the valley half of Brighton in that visit.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling toward the front bar.
The supervisor of City sent the ball to the network just before he ran out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Master's Department at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker scene in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play outlet game against Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in a decisive way, there was little reason to force another beginning.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer is hoping to get thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get into a decision, but they have one game of forecast over Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Department.
Rockies received at least a “wildcard” room with their 5-2 victory on the Nationals on Friday evening, but the team is still trying to reach its first title.
“ Even though we play free, at least we can play for the electrical atmosphere in Denver, and the other team will certainly have to play its best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to struggle with such circumstances?"
Nationals still have to report about who will be the first caster in the game of Sunday, but it is thought they will let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for 34 times, took a training course on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is a normal Sabbath with him.
This caster at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 windshots for 220 2/3 cycles during this stage.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president directed the matter around Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge, when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of supporters of the rebellion in the mid - term period.
“ Everything is in the field in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important choices of our life.
These are one of the big, big... I don't offer myself, but I do it, so I go around a lot to fight for great suppliers," he said.
Trump continued and said: “You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you can see it happen now.
And they are determined to regulate any way that is necessary, you see the cruelty, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to take power and rule, they just want power and rule, we don't give it to them.
He said that democrats were working to “beat and stop. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, “the democrats are mad and bad and cruel and unfair. ”
He named the Deputy Minister Dianne Feinstein, the Board of Democrats in the Decisive Committee of the Deputy Board, and was answered with a loud voice from the audiences.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was that you who broke the document?
Ha, what.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I waited in one... it was really bad physical expression, the worst I've seen."
The group of workers is no longer an obscure church.
He Does Not Exhibit Those That Explain his mind
When acting moments in my class chose to complain to me, it was hardly surprised.
I am still the last of many senators of the working class who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan ryan, my consensus received similar treatment, because she protested severe prejudices against Jews.
In my case, I was disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The ingredients were important to have an accountable economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar matters as Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
The notice of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we do not want the meetings to understand outside and to be successful. ”
In my eight - year work as a member of the worker class, Friday meetings have been most often that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of 'great and better' policy has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has been more and more discovered that different views have not been passed in the Working Party and that all views are judged by whether the leaders of the class consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I had previously thought had similar political views as I had, began expecting me to take a complete reversal and to implicate the views I had never agreed before, whether it was about national security or common market area of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and then little matters what I say - follows the crushing misrespects on social media where my elimination, central government matters are denied, and I told that I should not be in the Workers' Group.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of my comments are usually political.
I am admired of professionalism and confirmation of those who have to endure the holiness of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never disturb.
One of the most disappointing factors in this political period is how attacks and offensives have become a normal part of the everyday game.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the worker class should be a tranquil culture.
The reality is that we are no longer obsessive church, and with each untrust or change of rules, the class becomes more and more three.
I've been given many recommendations for the last two years, not too high, and then I'd be “All right” with me.
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Working Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the disadvantaged government thatcher, who left my school office in degradation, I have struggled for a better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city control or at the assembly.
I have never hide my political views, nor at the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have some doubts about my policy views and where I disagree with the current leaders.
With those who supported the suggestion on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country comes to Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses, and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my devotion to the leaders of the Working Party.
But my only message that I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those who are within my controversy, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you with pride, and I promise that no threats to rejection or political elimination will disappear me from doing what I think is for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unquestioned Team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits could have ceased the final outcome of something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had distinguished the victory in this hurtful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership department.
They are now in the top of the list and one of the ten still unquestioned.
Finally, their stronger defense and better use in facilities made homemen more victorious, and Peter Murchie trainer had the full right to be happy.
“ We have received hard opposition in our games here and are still unquestioned, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “They deserve commendation, they used their chances better than we do,"
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr in a 14 minute after Frazier Climo turned the visit, but a yellow panel on the coach of the chief, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot reached touch targets.
Climo increased the lead Ayr with a hell before he scored with a kick right for a half game and then touched target and came Ayr over 17-5 in a half game.
But Melrose started a second half of power and touchpoint Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned to the visit, decreased the difference to five points.
After that, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with touch target from Stafford McDowall, after Climo returned.
Blair Macpherson, Leader of Ayr, then got the yellow panel, and Melrose again used to be a man with a touch target from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard visit.
However, the homes returned strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow panel because of climo without the ball, MacPherson touched the target behind the Ayr visit, after an extra pitch.
Climo turned the visit, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe got sparked David Amrstrong from vite and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touch point of the team.

“The sea is ours: The coastless country of Bolivia is hoping that a court will open again to the Pacific
The rollers are guarded of the headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
General buildings flag the blue flags.
Flower stations from Titicaca water to the Amazon years are marked: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
In a wide range of landfilled Bolivia’s memorial of the coastal line that lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in a fresh memory, along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice in Haag on October 1, after five years of painting.
“ Bolivia has the power, the cohesion spirit, and the hypocrisy, of course, waiting for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a soccer diplomate.
Many inhabitants of Bolivia will monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large scale throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Haag will determine Bolivia in favour of their requirement that Chile should have access to Bolivia after many decades of difficult conversations.
On Monday, it is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the Indians, who will fight for reselection next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he later promised in August.
However, some recorders believe that the Court of Justice was in favour of Bolivia, and that it would do little if he did.
The court with a headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to give a country from Sile and has decided that the decision will not affect the conclusions of possible discussions.
The fact that the Court’s decision comes only six months after listening to the final talk indicates that the matter “was not complex, ” said Paz Sárate, a silent expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years did not matter to Bolivia, but they have caused the country to be reversed.
“ The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale’s glorious words have declined all the well - being of Sile, she said.
Bolivia and Sile will continue to talk at some time, but it will be very difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two lands have not changed to an ambassador.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a unique opportunity to open up for a new relationship with Sile ” and the opportunity to“ end a dispute that is nearly 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of the Roman Americas, was using this matter as a political increase.
“ Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ It is an opportunity to see that we need to reconcile in the past. ”
North Korea says that nothing will be of nuclear weapon unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, foreign minister of North Korea says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His reply now comes when Mike Pompeo, U.S. foreign minister, seems to be starting to start again discussions on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “drooms” to continue the continued business and counterfeiting of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever knee northern Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the statement unless Pyongyang takes the first steps to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
Yet, great doubts are that Pyongyang is serious by taking down weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang for the next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Ticus shows in Paris present the latest line of large head clothes that will come into the fashion scenes near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many kinds of cruel hats in super sizes for their SS19 line in the fashion area that broke the competitor of the fashion week in Paris.
The number of pictures of very unpleasant hats has been shown on Instagram in summer, and these designers have had their recent creations shown in fashion visions.
The main work of Valentino was a great light - brown hat with a wide range of bats that looked like the feathers and hidden heads of the furniture.
Of other components of the super size, water melons could be seen put stones, seeds, and even ananas, but these items are not designed to maintain a heat on the head.
Thom Browne also presented many kinds of strange masks, just at the right time for a horror.
Many of the colorful masks had merged lips and were rather similar to Hannibal Lecter rather than high school.
One mask was similar to a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others were similar to an inflammatory ice in bread form.
If you want to talk in the pic, you're lucky.
Tistic experts foretell that the great hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats bring a dose on the “La Bomba” hook with more than 60cm large bats that have sprayed their heads from Rihönnu to Emily Ratajkowski.
The inspiration on the back of the very unhandled hat that was seen on all social media was the inspired one of the other major compartments that appeared in the fashion area — a throat beach that was almost the same as the swim - clothing motel that bar it.
The orange barbecue, with barbecues and white hands of leather, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus in the modern week of Paris.
Luke Armitage, a familiar student of the famous people, interviewed FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and bushes appear in the fashion stores for the next summer, since the designer has caused such a great impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demands for supersize substrates. ”
John Edward: Tongue Capacities Required for World Citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the excellent results of their students, and it has continued in 2018 with new, glorious test results that are still strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other communities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in defense for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools are designed to prepare their students for further study, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizens.
As a training industry that can compile and teach by specially designed study records, we see that new languages continue to be a popular study material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If thou speakest to him in his mother's language, it touches his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot only trust English in building relationships and trusts with people from other countries.
Tests of this year show that language is the top of the lists of the highest proportions of students who are taking tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the fine A in mandarine, while 72 percent of those who learned Germans, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as a selector, are set in the same seat as scientific studies (scientific science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
An investigation conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that for the reasons for employers’ admitting that jobs were difficult to handle, 17 percent were due to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require knowledge in languages, this ability is necessary in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real forum in the future if they learn another language, but it is a knowledge that ends out of their life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically provide a multitude of individuals with a preliminary view of the competition.
According to a survey made by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to keep conversations, and French was the only language that was spoken of two characters of percentages, or 15 percent.
Hence, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language training.
Differentness, especially in recent countries, will give children a better opportunity to find a significant job.
In Scotland, the languages they teach differ between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classical new issues, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain when they look forward to 2020, such as mandarine or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scots private schools are committed to offering a study environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be refused that, at this time, in a global business environment, language remains necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
Actually, today’s languages should really be considered as “international knowledge of communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity, and superiority to the young Scotland.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Swedish Ministry of Private Schools

Timelines for the Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channels
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first is tonight in Wheeling in the West Virginia county.
He is one of the five organised meetings next week, where he will also stop at friends' places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the decision to confirm his choice of a new High Court judge has been suspended, Trumped, because it is a result of building up support for the next mid-term season, because the repucces are at risk of losing control of the congress when voting is paid in November.
At the time, what's Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you look at him on the network?
Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 19.00 p.m. at the eastern coastal time tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the network below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consult the court proceedings on Brett Kavanaugh, appointed High Court Judge, where excited for the accusations of sexual reliability. The Board of Appeal of Vote to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the main goal of the meetings of Trump is to help the rebellions reach a better step, waiting for difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s Chairship was that these five meetings that will be held next week were aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters of idolatry when the rebellion tries to protect and increase by the majority of the elders and at the meetings, ” according to Reuters News Office.
“ Governance of the Chamber is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many counties as possible as it is now starting a different military period, ” said the unnamed speaker from Trumps’ elections to Reuters News Chamber.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco scene in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and that the Pittsburgh media tell him, ” according to the West Virginia Metro News newsroom.
The meeting on Saturday will be another Trumps visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with more than 40 percent will in this region in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the prosecutor of the republics of West Virginia to the Senior Department, but he's in the bottom of the researcher.
“ It is not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters News Office.
Clearer Becker 2018: The United States Team shows a willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual creation on Sunday
After three unilateral rings, the quarter, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what needed in this race about the Ryder Becker.
Swings in success are a sports idea that has been discovered and who players truly believe in, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say that the success is now lying?
“ They had six points of predecession, and now it is four points, so that the success is rather our side now, I expect," said Jordan Spieth when he started in the race of the day.
Europe, of course, has a predecessor, four steps before, with twelve additional points.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in the sails, and they can be hoping over many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and who got three points of four.
Spieth has played greatly awesomely and leads with his example.
The good cryes increased as a path to the ring, and he put a vital pocket down to feast all four steps in the game after he and Thomas had been two steps below two games.
His pussy, who guaranteed the victory in the 15th hole, was like a joyful cry, a cry of the kind that tells you he believes that the American team still has a victory hope.
“ You just have to dive deeply and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can now.
18 holes to work in.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the inevitable history of the beaker.
This strange but thrilling European pair has worked four games and cannot do anything wrong.
The “Moliwood ” was the only pair that got a swallow on Saturday, but they also avoided swallows on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday and on the nine holes on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly show that they are the pair that needs to victory on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to conquer the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sits over the Le Golf National Valley.
The best option would be that both of them did it at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quarter in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swine grew into a hole, which they never got to climb.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourths and fourths are so exciting to look into the neighborhood because of the interconnection between the pairs, their recommendations, their non - advisory advice, and the way they can change the playtable.
Europe has played better as a team here and has a considerable predecessor before the end of the day, but this quartz also showed that the United States team has the will of battle that some have doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership before the final day of the race about the Ryder beaker
Europe will be a good preliminary date before the end of the cup's Ryder after a quarter of Saturday, with the preliminary 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari had the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had trouble, and had four points on the Le Golf National Field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to get back to the payer, which it lost in Hazeltine's field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States army in the morning's four-cuttle game and won 3-1.
The United States showed greater opposition in the quarters and worked two games but did not gain the score difference.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the beaker.
Fleetwood is the first European newman who works four grades in a row, and he and Molinari, who had the nickname “Molliwood ” after a wonderful weekend, are only the second pair working four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder’s Becher’s history.
After the victory of Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - round game, they showed a great number of teams and worked the downturn of Woods and the U.S. Newman Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius several times, but he has now lost 19 out of 29 games in quadratic games and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was exhibited for the morning’s four - round game, returned to his companions, Henriks Stenson in the quarters, and worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, which are in the first and third places on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not take all the steps on this mild and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
A three -fold victory in the great race in the golf, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas set the goal for the United States with two steps on Saturday.
They worked with trouble 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-cules games and came back later and triumphed Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarters after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder that the team had worked up four steps at the beginning of a individual success, although Furyk’s team needed only a steady number of times to continue the beaker.
However, after being the next one for two days, a computer attack on Sunday seems to be overwhelmed.
North Korea says one-sided weapon “inevitably” without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea said that on Saturday, the continued customer only did not trust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, at the annual General Assembly, said that North Korea had undertaken “a considerable action to demonstrate well-being” last year, for example by stopping nuclear and fire-fight tests, taking down the nuclear testing area, and praising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty of the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take our nuclear weapons down first. ”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North-Corraine complaints about the opposition of Washington at a "stage-shift" approach to nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his declaration seemed special to the extent that he did not deny a single-sided nuclear disarmament cleanly out as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint declaration of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim named to work “a nuclear weapon of the Korean Coreshagan” and Trump gave promises to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been searching for solutions to bind the formal end of the Korean War in the years 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang has to leave its nuclear weapons after the first time.
Washington has also been obliged to relax with the strict business tab against North Korea.
“The United States demands that “energy weapons take the first place ” and increase the pressure by using customers to achieve their own, and even contradict the declaration of ending the war,” Ri said.
“ There are only dreamsome people who don’t know anything about us to think that the customer can knee us.
But the problem is that continued customers increase our confidence."
Ri was not referring to the plans of another meeting between Kim and Trump, as the leader of the United States talked about at S.D. before the week.
Instead, the council spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea last five months, adding: “If the member of this nuclear disarmament is South Korea instead of the United States, this is not the case of nuclear weapons in the Koreans. ”
In spite of this, the tone of Ri was very different from his speech earlier when he said at the General Assembly that it was inevitable to draw fires from North Korea to the United States continent after “the Devil President” Trump called Kim“ firefighter” in suicide.
In the past, Trump threatened to “destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim with the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards the disarmament, but said that there was still a lot of work, and that the business clients would continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council of SD should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On Thursday, however, Mike Pompeo, United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs at the Security Council of SD, said: “The Security Council’s policy must continue until complete nuclear weapons have taken place and confirmed it. ”
The Security Council was agreed to increase the business offices of North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and fire-fighting schemes.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line of the General Meeting SD and said that he would visit Pyongyang again for the next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for “incredible demands. ”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down fireplaces and nuclear stations if the United States took “conform action. ”
He said that Kim had told himself that the “similar actions ” he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and operations towards normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a study in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night by means of caffeine tablets.
Studies revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little as nothing comes to the basic situation of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor in sleeping medicine at Harvard, and an expert at the Brigham and the Female Hospital, designed the course and believes that it is the first time in the United States.
He was given the idea of doing a course of study after reading about the effects of sleep shortages on a naval class.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why is this first told me now, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep that surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
Study, held for the first time of a year, explains the basic elements of how good sleeping helps in sports and even contributes to general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric physician at Harvard, and manager of the school’s healthcare service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepless during the week.
Study is a time of time and includes various interactive tasks.
One part is the picture of a home room, where students click on coffee balls, window tents, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance can worsen by lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good busy before sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the conduct of students in the same way.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that covers those who are alert and learning the whole night still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages are increasing problems.
Assurance to a sufficient sleep of good quality should be the “authorisation” of students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatting, because a lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food, so that the body is ongoing.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old professor of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler set up the course, one of the professor’s curses in Harvard last year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they start college.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students intend to set an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to raise them, and consider the harmful effect from blue light that electrical screens and LED lights give away, but it may confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems with exteriority when Stevens Gerrard's divided team had to consume 1-0 losses on Livingston, according to Dolly Menga's mark.
Lead Ibrox wanted to get his first victory on his outlet after his victory at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt army gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in his 18 games as his executive manager. The team is now eight steps after Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership Department.
Contaminated seven minutes before half-game, the Rangers team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to balance.
Rangers is now falling down to sixth seat, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only after Himernian.
Rangers may have had further problems after the liner Calum Spence had to get a clue for head damage after some item was thrown into it from the valley half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that snatched Ayr away and came to the front of Betfred's beaker.
Holt, however, maintained the same layout of Livi 11 that reached the stage of Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained servants ruled over the opposition.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more chances with the balls it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the play when first sending from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he shot out.
The long extras from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, shot out of the front.
Rangers returned control of the game, but seemed to live in hope rather than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales really felt that he had had to get hell when a quarter was finished by the game, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Columbian call.
Rangers only reached two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former targeter Ibrox, had not had much to have to protect a shell from Lassana Coulibaly and easily shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the chances of Livi in a 34 - minute period were despite the overhand of the other team, no one can deny that they deserve it, but not only because of their endurance.
Rangers failed to do anything from Jacobs' long extra shots again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his calmness and chose to send to Menga, which was easy to do.
Gerrard took care of a half game and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly and the change had effect nearly immediately when the back guard came Morelos in, but Kelly crashed quickly and ran forward to closing the shoot.
Still, Livingston continued to narrow the guest to play exactly the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long time the consignment on the other.
Holts had been able to increase his lead on the final aminos, but McGregor was well able to deny Jacob's chance before Lithgow ran to the point from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a guardian of Rangers, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson pointed it back.
Almanak: The man who found out the Geiger counter
This is the day that the future physician John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed an approach to study and measure radioactivity, and the invention eventually led to a device called Geiger measuring.
The Geiger Measurer has received a fixed seat in the science world since it, but was also popular in the popculation, for example in the film “Bells of Coronado” from 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in various roles as scientists:
A man, “What is this really? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger measured, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put this hearing tool on you, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."

New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know hazardous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can be “seen” proteins, common in many cancer cells, and then re-injected to the patient
Test vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can “see” proteins called HER2 and are found in many forms of cancer. Then the cells are injected back to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute of Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that the vaccine is extremely effective. ”
HER2 “Supercisions of cancer, ” including breast cancer, ovarians, lungs, and stomach, says Professor Berzofsky.
Similar immune cells have been taken from patients and the “frequent” attack on cancer cells have been treated with one type of leukaemia.
Canye West held long loneliness in support of Trump and carried MAGA derhufu after it appeared in the SNL TV.
It didn't work well.
At the Canye West in the studio in Saturday Night Live factors after a long - aged talk, where he commended the President of the United States of Donald Trump and said he would offer himself to President in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he had Make America Great Derhufu, he long spoke against democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have so often spoken to white people who say: “How can you like Trump, he is a race hater? ”
If I was worried about race hatred, I would have been moved from the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL began with a pillow where the Hollywood star Matt Damon made jokeful witness to the Board of Kavanaughs for the Board of Seniors because of the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford on sexual intrusion.
Although West's long-end wasn't sent out, the recording of it was placed on the media of Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by showing the recording.
Also, West had complained to the observers that he had received bad receptions because of his hatching.
“ I was placed in a single background.
They told me: “Don’t go up to the field with this dish. ”
They put me in ankle!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole?" and said that he would put on his superheroic dress “because that means that you can’t order me for works, do you want the world to make progress?
Try the love."
His comments were met with a bulb from the audiences at least twice, and the SNL players seemed to be shameful, according to Variety, and one attendant said to the newspaper: “There was stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the song of Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his field progress when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the chairman of the TPUSA class, who said on Twitter: “To one of the most courageous souls: THAT REQUIREMENTED THE MUGNUM. ”
But Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West would simply be “he himself, and it is quite wonderful. ”
“But I chose not to reward someone (which buys his music or clothes or supports his “list”) that I feel supporting and spreading ideas that are harmful to my society.
He's free.
It's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the being formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change the name and feet into the track of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another raper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and cannot forget the musical goddess of Prince, who changed his name to signs and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the Star of the Crown Games, criticized toxic male
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure play from the HBO, the Crown Games.
However, the 31 - year - old player has criticized the standpoint of the male hero, saying that such a role on the screen is often felt that young boys need to be hard to gain respect.
At the Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit said that he believes that “nothing went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic male in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion from the Kronic Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, acknowledged that he had “a stronger view of how to deal with this matter. ”
"Persoonly I feel at the moment - what's wrong with the male?"
“ What have we taught men in their growing up, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit thinks that the television is partly responsible for an increase in toxicity, due to a very male person in television.
He continued: “What is inherent, and what is taught?
What is taught in television and outdoor streets that make young boys feel like they must be made by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions at the same time - how do we change this?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also acknowledged during the interview that he would not play in any other Crownic elements after the ranking of the next summer, saying that he had “sufficiently had had had a lot of feasts and horses. ”
From November to November, Kit will play in a re-creation of the True West, image of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of the film manufacturer and his brother who is a robber.
The player recently said that the best thing to have played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these aspects, so that they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, my dear Jon Snow, who Kit played in this Emmy Privilege.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in renal infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A large majority of the new infections had sex, which is a change from the previous.
Previously, the HIV virus was rapidly spread into some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
In contrast, the number of those infected by the HIV virus has fallen down to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at the Yunnan region's group.
However, the number of infected HIV viruses or AIDS has increased about 100.000 people from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, homosexuality has not been illegal in China, but much discrimination against LGBT people is still supposed to occur.
Due to the content of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of males who engage in sex with other men are finally married to a woman.
Many infections will be caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s Government has promised access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that the employee has disclosed data from the senior Members of the Republics, criticizes "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory teachings"
Maxine Waters, a senator, refused on Saturday the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information on their Wikipedia pages by the three Senatorials of the Republic.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that these claims came from “extreme ” extremists and websites.
“ Lieves, lies, and more foolish lies, ” said Waters in a declaration on Twitter.
The information published, according to the home addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. Congressors Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from the unknown members of Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Board of Appeal at Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court of Justice, for the accusation of sexual reliance.
Sometime after the three elders had heard Kavanaugh, the work came.
Continuous pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said that the IP numbers identified by the author of the information were connected to the Waters Office and published information on one of its staff, according to Capitol Hill’s information.
“ This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My star - every personal information and security is now in danger because of these wrong accusations - in no way responsible for this information lecture.
This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the network, including Ara Fleischer, former news agent of the White House.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she has no ability to sit on a meeting.
When a person is accused of reasonlessness, do not react with anger.
It must not be opposed.
This should not be questioned for reasons of accusation.
It must be calm and persuasive."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh judge, who critics said that it seemed to have been too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the prosecutor of the rebellions against Waters in the mid - season, also said his view on Twitter.
“ Great if true, ” he tathed.
In his declaration, Waters said that her office had “appropriate authorities and lawyers informed of these unfair claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilt will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be dealt with in charge of all the things that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees. ”
Film criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - a photograph with Rowan Atkinson proves to be powerful
It is now used to look for the Brexit references in all new pictures where Britain comes to history, and it seems to apply to this releasing of the Johnny English graphic series - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just wake back to life in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this cankish satira tell us how evident we are as new exports for the country?
Whether or not, Johnny English has been renewed for the second time to clothed all - his name shows, above all, that he is created for vision in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is a wise secret serviceman who seems to live over thrilling personalities, but is a little mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little removed from the man who played one node for the Chariots of Fire at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious inhabitant of the world that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, since he left everything with himself in trouble.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking into a helicopter dressed in the middle of the age, and the helicopter leaves swallowed in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his ability to imagine, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely surfacely taught, especially now already “severe” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible pictures also offer a shameless excitement.
It seems to be rather intended for children than for adults, and I felt the adventures that Johnny English was not as impressive and focused as atkinson's silent smiles in Mr. Beans' genius.
The persistent predecessor of the picture is now that Britain is in great trouble.
Computer hackers have reached breaking into the secret spies network of Britain and encountering the identity of all British spies, to a great anxiety for the spies on the watch - where Kevin Eldon is unfortunately in a too small role.
This is the final step for the Prime Minister, who is proud and devoted to the person and is in great disaster because of massive political enemies: Emma Thompson is doing his best with its role as a person to remind of Theresu May, but the manuscript is not on many fish for it.
Her advisors tell her that all the active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been sitting in a holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English to history, now school manager at some fine school, but also teaches secretly how to be spies: here are some funny jokes when English offers a special school that reminds of the picture School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at a emergency meeting and meets there Bough, formerly tired his companion, who was playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a cab manager, but in that powerful role, Vicki Pepperdine does not completely get his light shine.
The catalytic physician who crushed all the things in her service of the Highness has come back to the gorge and meets the ophelia Bulletovu, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is confronted with the magic of the glorious billions of the engineering that says that it can be solved from British computer problems: that is the evil Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their raptures: they turn in a fine French restaurant secrets as servants, they make crush when they make themselves in the luxury snake of Volta, and English turns everything on a turn when he trys to use visual glasses to present the inside of the Volta house.
There is nothing to save in this final point, but though the image is fertile and energy-containing, some of its child’s material in its entirety is obscured.
Mediumly good stuff.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, could I just think: can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his skills?
The group of workers refuses to create a four - day work week plan for British, with the same wages as five days ago.
The worker class, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, now considers a tremendous plan that would allow British to work for four days a week, but will be paid for five.
According to the class, the supervisors want to make use of the savings from the revolution in a satellite analysis, and make employees benefit by receiving an additional holiday.
Then employees could enjoy three days of long weekends, without lowering their wages.
Sources say that the idea would "pass" to the class's economic plan and its policy on improving the interests of workers.
The Trades Union Convention has supported the shortcoming of the working week for four days, which led to employees to take advantage of economic changes.
A reporter from the Upper Department of the Working Party said to Sunday Times: “At the end of the year, it is estimated to be notified of a policy review.
“The breakdown will not be in one night, but four days of working weeks are the goal of the approach to the group to change the economy in behalf of the worker and the overall industry policy.”
The worker class would not be the first class to support this idea, but the green class promised four days of a week of work in his electoral course in 2017.
However, the goal is not supported by the worker class as a whole.
A speaker of the Working Party said: “Four days of working weeks are not on the class’s agenda, and the class is not considering to introduce it. ”
John McDonnell, Minister for Industry of Shadows, used the Working Party’s Group last week to describe its ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to return power from "unknown managers" and "growing communities" offices.
The plans of the shadow minister also mean that the current shareholders of water plants may not be able to return all their shares, as the government of the Working Party could ‘reduce’ because of malicious errors.
He has also confirmed the plans to place jobs in the management committees of enterprises and to create a shared ownership fund to allow 10 percent of the property private enterprises to their employees, who could receive 500 pounds of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether the FBI's study of Kavanaugh could get them to change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge, and raises the question of whether its conclusions could be given to the senior Members of the Republics to withdraw their support.
At a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter at the "60 minutes" section, and the senior minister John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would give them a change of view.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his collar from South Carolina.
“ I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
“ I said when the case began, I said I spoke to the Cavanaugh judge.
I called him after the accusation was made and asked, “Do you do this? ”
He was determined, firm, untworn.
However, Graham’s speech seems to be indispensable.
“ I have made my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be surprisingly an accusation to change it, ” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it firmly, ” added Graham and answered Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And all she mentioned could not confirm that.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new will change."
What is the international civil celebration and has it done to reduce poverty?
The World Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual musical event where the series of major stars will occur and with similar effective policies; the end of poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year when the international civil celebration will be held, and tens of thousands of people will be moved to Central Park, not only to listen to musical items from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise attention to the real goal of the festival to end the sorrow of poverty before 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), which is an international battle organisation that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of fighters.
In order to obtain a free review of the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP records), music guests had to complete various tasks, or “operations”, such as working voluntary work, sending emails to some of the world’s leaders, calling calls or using other valid means to help raise attention to their goals of binding the end of poverty.
But how much has the celebration been accomplished, now in 12 years, in order to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of paying people with free music really a way to convince people to call for actions, or is this just one so-called "smelting" operation - because people think it's doing something that matters by signing the demand list on the network or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “activities” from its supporters to call for many different goals.
It says that these actions helped to get the world’s leaders to describe commitments and policies that amount to more than $35 billion that will affect life than $2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group included 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, which has been invested or collected at least 10 billion dollars.
The group estimates that the funds collected have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One principal obligation comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain, who is working on “helping children to enjoy their full enjoyment, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help to bind the end of the country’s disadvantage, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With support from the British Government, supporters, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave this social injustice that is a part of the past," said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition with listeners to the music in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 calls were sent to Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government informed the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is the following: “Why do you think you can end up such poverty? ”
Global Citizens replied: “There will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will be lost.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that struggled for the rights of citizens and the removal of race separation before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the surveys are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the maritime army as a “restriction” to prevent the export of energy from Russia, says the Minister of Inner Kingdom.
“ If necessary, ” Washington could use the marine army to prevent power from reaching the market in Russia, including the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to Washington Examiner’s report.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country is working on the government’s legal basis, was proposed to explore new markets.
“I think the reason for their beings in the Middle East is that they want to make business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he should have said accordingly.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to counteract it.
“The United States can use the marine army to ensure that waterways are open and to create obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not come on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the guest meeting in the Consumer Energy Alliance, a well - being group called the “Right of the Power Manager” in the United States.
He continued and collapsed Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The financial option for Iran and Russia is more and less profitable for energy donations and to replace them for others, ” he said and said Russia has only one card in the inheritance of economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trumps Government wants to increase its exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much more expensive option for European consumers.
In order to do this, official staff of Trump's government, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participation in the "unauthorized" Nord Stream 2 project to add new energy management, which Trump says would make Berlin "catch" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of North Stream 2 energy management, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion beds, is only a financial project.
Russians say that strong opposition to Washington against the project is simply driven for economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to use pressure and that consumers should be able to choose about the bears, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s Ministry of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, United States Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, who has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federal Federation of German Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to divide into EU energy policy and two-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“ I am very inconceived that the foreign government divided from our energy team, ” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industries (BDI) after a meeting held recently with Angelu Merkel, the Cancer of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" offering himself to the presidential office in 2020, she says:
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, Senator of the District of Massachusetts, said that she would “consider seriously ” to offer herself to president after the median season.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering herself at a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then a woman also needs as a leader, ” she said, according to the news of The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider seriously asking myself to the President's office.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “passing the country in a wrong way.
“ I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democratic ones, ” she said.
Warren has been obsessed with his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said: “Of course, we have to let the FBI examine the matter before the voting procedure takes place. ”
On Thursday, however, an examination shows that the majority of the voters in Warrens’ county do not think it should offer themselves in 2020.
Fifty and eight percent of “likelyer” voters in Massachusetts said that the senior assembly should not offer himself, according to an explanation published by Suffolk University of Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty and two percent said to support her procurement.
The survey showed greater support for the procurement of Deval Patrick, former government manager, where 38 percent claimed to support his possible procurement and 48 percent claimed to be opposed.
Among other popular democrats discussed for a possible presidential proposition in 2020, Joe Biden, former president, and Bernie Sanders, Senior Deputy of Vermont.
Biden said that he was going to make a public decision in January, according to the Associated Press news.
Sarah Palin refers to the shock of Track Palin at the Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after having joined the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of home victims on Monday Evening
“ My son is dealing with great difficulties after coming back, I feel with other families who experience the effects of an accidental disturbance and the spiritual wounds that our soldiers return home with, ” she told the listeners at the Donald Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the mill in the room, ” saying that her son and other war soldiers“ come back only differently, they are hard and wonder if any respect is brought for what their companions in the army and the air forces and other armies of the army have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent the notification of domestic violence and for arms under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police department’s speaker in Wasilla.
18 counties and Washington D.C. support the challenge of a new approach
18 counties and Washington City support legally a challenge against a new policy of the United States which refuses victims who flee to a refugee or home violence.
Representatives of the 18th Chambers and the city sent a trial report on Friday in Washington to support the refugee seeker who objects to the policy, according to the report from NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions the laws of the American Civil Liberties Union has not been declared against the state policy.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were arbitrary members, ” used her violence, but American employees rejected her request on July 20th.
She was put in a guard in Texas.
The inquiries supporting Grace declared El Salvador, Honduras, and Gvatemala as countries where problems associated with genders and home violence are increasing, and the number of advertisers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new prosecutor approach recalls a decision set by the prosecutor committee of immigrants in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fleeed home violence to apply for a refuge.
Karl Racine, State Attorney Washington, declared on Friday that the new policy “had been reflected in several decades of state and international laws. ”
“American law requires a decision on all applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, which breaks against this rule,” said the judicial report.
In addition, lawyers said in the report that the policy that refused immigrants to enter would be harmful to the US economy, and said that immigrants were more likely to establish businesses and “have an important workforce. ”
Jeff Sessions, a prosecutor of the government, ordered judges in immigrant matters to stop offering a victim who fled home violence and arbitrary violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on races, religions, nationality, or membership of a certain group of society or political views may apply for a refugee, ” said Sessions in their report on the policy on 11 June.
The army was never intended to solve all problems, not even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, which speak the dead double
Conditions are increasingly difficult for those who survived.
“ There is much excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son in the help center of the city of Palu.

I hope they're safe."
U.S. Secretary of the United States charges China with "suppressions" with "propaganda advertisements"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in an American newspaper to deal with mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the US embassy of China in Peking accused of using American media to distribute propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, spoke last Wednesday of the advertising of the Chinese magazine in the Des Moines Register, which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after having accused China of trying to be mixed into the United States' congresses, which will be on November 6, China refuses this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to be mixed into the American elections marked what official American representatives said Reuters’ news office was a new degree in an increasing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote business, Peking and Washington have a permanent trade race with new import duties on both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that in the early business war, China was designed to harm exporters in regions such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Rebellion Group.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Messenger of China, and former Head of State in Iowa for a long time, but it transports a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in his commentary in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, said: “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is using the dear freedom of speech in the United States and our free media by publishing costly advertising in the Des Moines Register, ” Branstad said in his article.
“ On the other hand, a few contradictions can be found in newspapers on the streets of Peking, and there is no true reflection on the different views that the Chinese could have on the concerns of China’s economic policy, since the media are firmly under the chinese group’s slope, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China came away from the invitation to publish his article, ” but he did not determine what magazine it was.
Experts warn that the republikums are making female electors determine them for the median seasons with the Kavanaugh language.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, during the next median seasons, because many of the rebellions have shortened and preserved Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge, who has sentences of sexual injustice.
Very strong feelings have been around this matter, and most rebellions have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“ This is not possible, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Syracuse, with The Hill for a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the call of Jeff Flake, the Senior Deputy District of Arizona, in the last minute on the FBI's investigation, is enough to calm up the electorates.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a consular, and a speaker for the freely oriented group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November approaches ” when they protested on the walks of the Elderly Department when the rebellions governing the decision committee decided to continue by the name of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The mind and enthusiasm of the electoral will go out of all power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, irrespective of politics, at the news page.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be greater, especially in women's electoral and younger electorates, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely choose."
The articles foretold a relapse if the rebellions pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for a witness of Ford, declaring her accusation of sexual incentive from him.
“ This has become a big clothing for the Repeopeca class, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republic of the Republic, early last week, according to NBC News.
“ It is not just about the votes of the committee or the final votes or whether Kavanaugh is deceased on the class, it also relates to the way the republikations have handled this and how they have handled it,” said Guy Cecil, president of the United States Priority, a group who helps to choose democrats, at the news station.
However, the United States seems to disagree with who should believe in both Ford and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, and a few majority support the latter.
New opinions from YouGov show that 41 percent of respondents probably believed or likely the Ford testimony, while 35 percent surely said that Kavanaugh’s witness was faithful or likely.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations for Ford and from at least one other woman, Deboroh Ramirez, according to Guardian's news.
Ford witnessed the eed before the decision - making committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh had sex in front of her when they were both at a festival at Yale University at the 1990 ’ s.
The man who discovered the Internet is with the plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who discovered the network, is going to establish a sprot company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruth, is a company based on Solid, open work of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee grined that the deliberation behind Inruth would be “the government of the world. ”
“ We have to do this now, ” he said about the spray company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal data store on the network” or POD.
There can be a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, musical collections, and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The personal data store is unique to the user who can have access to any information.
The company calls it “personal electiveness by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is that the company will provide resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
Now, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security work that was purchased by IBM, some developers who were advised to work in the project, and a group of developers in voluntary work.
From this week on, technology developers around the world may create their own independent programs with the tools offered on the Inruption website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether a complete change should take place that would put their current business ambassador on their head in one night.
“ We don’t ask them for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in a article published on Saturday at Media that Inrude had “a goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps to protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid. ”
Berners-Lee converted the network in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an impressive voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to establish and chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes to Inrupt.
“ I am full of optimism for the next period of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Viktoric Cruise Priest and Handler of the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victory Cross during the former World War, a soldier who has been sheltered in his 100 years later.
Sera Bernard Vann, who had a position on the army, received the cross on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, he killed a secret protector four days later, and he never heard that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandfathers revealed his memories on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandfathers, Michael Vann, said that it was “awesome symbolic ” that the memorial response was revealed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honor.
According to the London Gazette magazine, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his chief army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin surgeon “through a very thick thick and under a hard shooting attack from guns and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran to the gun line, and with “great courage, ” he brought the line on before attacking a gun of one of his armies and overcome three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only months before the end of the war, the prime chief was killed by a German secret protector.
Michael Vand, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroes were “a thing I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vand, also laid a flower crane after the scratch, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he shares “the great privilege of taking part in the walk of the garbage, ” adding that“ the fans of true hero are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead of seeing Gurra pig
Just imagine, having awakened all night to see the superfull Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program was 13 fights from San Jose, of which six were on the main record, and they were shown in direct shipment all night in Britain at the Channel 5 channel.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British observers had an unexpected appearance when the broadcast turned into Gurra gris.
Some were unpleasant after watching the battle all night.
One fan of Twitter declared the switch to the child’s substance as “one kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to public rules, the material was not suitable for audience at 6 p.m., so they had to switch into child matters, ” said Dave Schwartz, the chairman of the market and communication for Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Gurra pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director Bellator, said they would cross their schedules and take audiences in Britain into the future account.
“ I think when I think of the reconciliation that we could probably solve this, ” said Coker.
“ But the morning is six o’clock on Sunday, and we can’t solve this until Sunday of our day, which is a Monday.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the shipment was changed, many text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all kind.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But that wasn't it, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We limit the evening at five battle instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out.
This is an unfortunate condition."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found a "mismight" for sexuality
The Olympic Depth Tom Daley said that he had suffered disadvantage to other people in their adultage because of their sexuality, but that encouraged him to achieve success.
The 24-year-old Daley said he hadn't realized that “he was different from others” until he went to a high school.”
In the radio program Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give “a hope. ”
He also said that the parent’s share reduced his interest in working the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular director, has taken a few months of vacation for illness.
Daley could be excited in the first part of Laverne and said that he felt to be “my man ” but all others when he was a child because“ it was not agreed in society to be delighted in both boys and girls. ”
He said: “To the present day, these feelings of feelings that I am inferior and otherwise give me the strength and strength to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “nothing, ” he said, so that he would not make any disappointment when he finally came up with his sexuality.
The double Olympia Bronshape has made a great deal as a supporter of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he heard him because he felt he was lucky to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give “a hope. ”
The world champion said three times that it would have “come surprised him ” to be in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old U.S. P.A., but said that the age difference would never have been a problem.
“When a man walks through so much in a young age” - but he took part in his first 14 - year - Olympic Games and his father died from cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find the same ages that had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his “all the views of life” had been suppressed.
“ If you had asked me last year, then everything turned about to win a golden price, ” he said.
“ Know what, it’s more important than the gold price in the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic Golden Prize."
His son is baptized in his head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father wouldn't have agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had been getting his tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he would not live long enough to sit in the first row, ” he said.
“ I kept in his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breathing stopped, and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he was not unquestioning, ” he said.
The next year, Daley struggled with the Olympia Games in 2012 and won a bronze price.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed about this all my life, to deepen me in front of the viewers at the home of the Olympic Games, not feeling better, ” he said.
It was also inspired to the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had inspired him for the Olympic Games and still gave him a hostage.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in a bad form and dead sitting on the class in the Ryder beaker on Saturday
The American American Phil Mickelson will meet on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder beaker, but he needs to find his old pace again so that it is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, was deceived to sit on the class after the presidency Jim Furyk’s decision for the races in a quarter game and a quarter on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the Hazard, as he has been so often before the United States, the day is divided by the five -fold master between being a cabbage manager and practicing the toys on the field in the hope of correcting what he has.
Mickelson, a 48 - year - old, was never the one who shot directly with the killers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Valley, where long glomps often punish for bad shots.
And not enough that the golffield is a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to fight against Frances Molinari, the victorial British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the newer Tommy Fleetwood team, and together they have worked all their four games this week.
If the Americans, which are four steps under when they take the first game of 12 single games, reach a good start, Mickelson’s game may divide their creations.
Furik declared his trust in his husband, but he could hardly say much more.
“ He perfectly understood the role he had today, klapped me on my back and took me out and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the roaming hall, and he has been so much better than this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but so it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will meet Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder beaker on Sunday.
This could market the end of the process in the Ryder beaker that has never achieved quite as much as other performances of its file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 pairs, and 7 times, but Furyk said that his presence has a certain unclean effect on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s the archaetic, the noble, enjoys making joke to people, and it’s great to have him in the joint room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players were happy to fight him in the week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, President of Europe knows that a lot of preliminary events can be lost quickly
The European leader Thomas Bjorn knows that the last day of the individual creation in Ryder can easily change to an uncomfortable experience.
The Dan first played in Valderrama in 1997, where under the control of League Seve Ballesteros had five points of predecession over the United States, but the right was to triumph at the end with the least possible score difference, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“One reminds us that we had a lot of forestry in Valderrama, we were with a lot of forshots in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only just so,” said Bjorn, who is seen here, after watching the 2018 season work 5-3 both on Friday and on Saturday, and reaching the preliminary 10-6 on Le Golf National Velle.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't done.
We'll all go to tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the steps are on the tablet.
We have our goals, and it's trying to work this cup, we're focusing on it
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our counterparts in the other team -- the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn was very pleased with his players’ difficulty and added: “I’m never going beyond myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
Tomorrow, it is the best of the individuals that are important, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a companion when everything goes well, but when you play one, all of you're trying to be a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the actors, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his companion, and he also needs to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek his players to stand better in individual games rather than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who worked three points of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of this great change in the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline, but ended to lose when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah. ”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the last day in 1999, had encouraged his players.
“ We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When it comes to building up, it causes great pressure on the game in the middle.
We ordered our players accordingly and let them play as we think we'll go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defence and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“ I chose these players in this order because I think they were all through, ” said Bjorn about their choice of players during the individual race.
The New Army of Germany is still suspended
The most recent German maritime army ships should have been built in 2014 to replace old army ships from the cold war period, but it will not be prepared until the next year, according to news in the region, for broken systems and increasing costs.
Based on “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leadership of the glany army of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been suspended until the first half of the year 2019, according to the records of the military speaker who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had to be taken to the benefit of the maritime army in 2014, but serious problems after the ship’s delivery took place.
The ships four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Sea Force in 2007 should replace the army ships of the Bremen class, which have arrived for their years.
They should be prepared for a powerful fallby, a lot of air protection and shipbuilding fire and hiding techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signs.
Other important characteristics are longer time of use – the most recent ships should be used for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant tails mean that the most recent military ships - which are said to enable Germany to show their strength on the sea - are already aged when they are finally taken into advantage, says The Time.
The F125 Army came into the news earlier when the German army officially refused to accept the fleet and returned to the Blohm & Voss slip in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship has returned to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of many women seriously “surfaced software and machinery ” which made the army useless if sent to war.
Software gallons were particularly important because the battle ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 men's crew, which is half less than in Bremen's army ships.
Also, the ship was too heavy to reduce its performance and to limit the ability of the army to improve it in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of “Rheinland-Pfalz” ships are considered twice more than ships in a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the defects in machinery, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the army, is beginning to cause problems.
It is said that he reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), but it was originally EUR 2.2 billion.
The most recent ships are particularly important in the light of the warnings that German superiorities in the outdoor are diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, acknowledged that the maritime army would actually be “a superior ship. ”
The representative said that the problem had survived in time, for older ships were taken off, but no ships were put in place.
He was sad that none of the commands of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be taken into use by the marine army.
National Trust Natural Protection Organizations Experiencing the Secrecy of Leather Blake
New research carried out in the Soviet highlands aims to find out how leather blades use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the results will bring new light on the behavior of these flooding mammals and help to guide the future of natural protection operations.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor various types of leather blades in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed at key points in the area to monitor the behavior of the leather blades over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also take care of handheld sensors.
Experts will identify all the recordings in order to find the frequency of the leather blocks, and what types do.
A map of habitats and a report will then be published to provide a precise picture of their geographic behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Consultant, hopes that the results show what kind of habitats are most important for the leather blocks and how they are used by each type.
This information will help to determine the cost of management of habitats, e.g. by creating nowhere and how to maintain forests for leather and other related species.
In the last century, in Scotland and throughout Britain, leather beams have decreased considerably.
They are in danger of building and development activities that affect their reigns and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including aeroplane paper, and certain physicians of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic meat.
Leather blobs are not really blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting ants, because they are used to hunt in the night.
They used high - evolved quarrying techniques to find insects and objects on their flight.
NTS, responsible for maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts who regularly carry out checks, scrutiny, and sometimes rescue operations work.
Even the first and one leather flourishing country of Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten leather trees of Scotland are home.
David Thompson, the overseer of the farm, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The area here at Threave is great for leather blobs, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees and full of good habitats.
But there is still a lot of uncertainty about leather blocks, so the work that we work here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to trigger."
He emphasised the importance of checking leather blocks before maintenance at home, since possible unwilling destruction of one rod can kill up to 400 female leather blocks and young and destroy all leather blocks in the area.
Leather blocks are protected and they are prohibited from killing, trying, disturbing, or destroying their flocks.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot of lessons about leather blades, and we do not know how well many of them are going. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusation of rape when lawyers prepare law against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him about rape “false news ” and says that people want to“ raise attention ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to legalize the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The frontier for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raising a U.S. woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said to have paid it $37,000 left for silence of the incident, according to the news of Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the accusation was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers that they were “false news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world master fifthly to the camera.
“ These people want to raise attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it is part of the work.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
The lawyers Ronaldos are preparing to lawyer Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “unconsciously showing a suspicion of private life, ” according to Reuters News Office.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would require improvement for “the same amount of the seriousness of the breakdown, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The meant incident was held in June 2009 in the Palms Hotel and the Playback in Las Vegas.
After meeting the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he should have raped her at the end, according to the documents laid for the Clark County District in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the most important incident and told her that he was “99 percent of a good man ” who fell in temptation because of the “1 percent. ”
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both agreed.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her burden at the hospital, but finally agreed to be seen outside of the court court, because she was “reasoned by refugees ” and was concerned about being“ degraded publicly. ”
She now says she wants to stop the seats because she is still in a shock after an accident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to take place, and in summer he went to the Italian giant Juve with a $100 million contract.
Brexit: United Kingdom would "see forever" to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among the Brexit car manufacturers, says Greg Clark Business Minister.
He added that it would be “a concern” that Toyota UK would have said BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would suspend the production of its Factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit would be without a contract that reality would cost a job, the effect from a delay to the border would be said.
The Burnaston engineering of Toyota Auris and Avensis cars produced almost 150,000 cars in the past, of which 90% were transferred to other European countries.
“I think that if Britain crashes from the EU by the end of March, we will see the production stations in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive Toyota, Burstaton.
Other British car manufacturers have revealed concerns about EU exit without agreement on how inter-national businesses should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says he will close his Mini Factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The most important concerns are what automobile manufacturers say is a risk if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract.
Toyota production lines are based on the reception at the last hour, where items are delivered every 37 minutes from stocks both in Britain and in the EU for cars manufactured after subscription.
If Britain declines the EU without a agreement on 29 March, it may be disturbed at the borders that the industry considers may lead to a disadvantage and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than daily in his shop in Derbyshire, said the company, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers Programme Theresu May for the Future Relationship with the European Union “is particularly designed to prevent these views at the border.”
“ We have to have an agreement, ” he said, “we want to have the best agreement that enables us not only to enjoy success in modern times, but as an opportunity that we can use,” said BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very successful addresses.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would stop, but warned that for a longer period, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, who is a trustman of the workshop, said that his employees were more and more concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
The government speaker said: “We have presented a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be suspended again, according to the White House.
The White House therefore declared on Sunday that a major meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, a member of the Assembly, could be “removable again for one week” now is the dispute for Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, continues.
Rosenstein is supervised by Roberts Mueller, a special prosecutor who examines Russian elections, associations between Trumps and Russian assistants, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For many weeks, stories have been in Washington about whether Trump will drive an accompanying state prosecutor and thus put Mueller’s independence in danger.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed a recording device to record a conversation with Trump, and the possibility of questioning the president from the seat by using the 25th additional article of the governing document.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, including the news that he was supposed to say.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was reported on Thursday, then he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that “not mostly ” wants to drive Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended so that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the Board of Appeal, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the females who have committed him to sexual insults, were witnessing both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation of the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, who further suspended the vote of the Senior Department.
Sarah Sander, a media representative of Trumps, was in the Fox News Sunday section.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him has not been set, it could be this week, and I think he may be suspended for another week because of anything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and it's always a pleasure for me to inform the media."
Some newspapers agree with this statement: Sanders have not held a newspaper meeting in the White House since September 10th.
Minister Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings would not be unpleasant about the “visuality ” of television news, but she said:“ I don’t agree with the fact that they have visuality. ”
She then gave evidence that the direct relationship between Trumps and media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions from the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, without referring to the authorization: “We have examined these numbers. ”
Sanders said: “If media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of the past weeks, and it'll replace media conferences when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Multimedia meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown a reason for this week in New York, when he showed his obstaclelessness and in times of strange behavior before a group of newspapers.
Minister for Health writes the EU’s healthcare professionals in Scotland due to the concerns of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written a worker from the EU working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to describe the appreciation of the nation and wish that it will continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of the application for a service application for EU people working within the public service sector.
In his letter, Dr. Freeman wrote: “For the summer, discussions between Britain and the EU have continued for deliberations and are expected to make a decision in autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare, if possible, a contract.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty time for you all.
That is why I would like to recognise how much I appreciate the work of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
Cooperation partners from the EU and across countries provide precious experience and skill that strengthens and improves the work of the healthcare service and is benefiting from the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home, and we really want you to stay here."

Foreign Buyers will be charged for higher rates when buying property in Britain
Foreign purchasers will be charged for higher rates when buying property in Britain. The surplus will be used to help homeless, according to the new programme of the Containment Group
The operation will make no success of Corbyn's campaigns to attract young electorates
Increased digests will be paid to those who do not pay tax in Britain
A Kingdom treasure estimates to earn 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign purchasers will be charged for higher rates when buying property in Britain. The surplus will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation is considered to be an attempt to make no success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young choosers by praising the house of advisable valuables and taxing people more.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain need to pay higher punishments, and the surplus will take place in the government's actions to help homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to the current pellets, including the increase of two years ago in an extra home and the sale of property for rent - may be up to three percent.
A Kingdom treasure estimates that the increase will generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreigners, which causes price increases and makes those who want to buy property for the first time harder to enter the market.
Many of the more chemical areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “draughters” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in petitions to help other young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining a high level of property by buying land but not using them, and encouraged May to stop the quotas of homes at the advisable value of fixing the ‘home treasures’ of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has reported a number of considerable repairs in housing matters, including the rental monitoring and the end of rentals.
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “In the past, I said that I would sanctify the restoration of the British dream during my first period - that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And it involves fixing our unsuccessful real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build up their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreigners and companies with a foreign headquarters to buy homes and for due British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own house has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Jack Ross, coach Sunderland, says that it is his "prime goal" to become a schotland trainer ever.
This 42-year-old Scotch now enjoys the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East Club, which is now sitting in the third seat in the first department, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland for some summer after coming back to the Scottish Deputy Department in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was hurt on the knee, and that was done," said Ross at the interview at the Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up to watch Scotland often in Hampden with my dad, as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I was doing well training the branch."
Forverars Ross who train Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer, Alloa Athletic Club, said, did not find any fear of following such famous names in such a large club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the election department? ’
He said that this club at the office of the elections for his construction and his position, in no doubt at home.
“ It’s not easy to get him there, but I’d probably just view me as a lucky one here if I came back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a trainer, after a period of time as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a Hearts trainer.
He helped Alloa to reconcile himself by falling down to the third department, and he changed St Mirren, who was falling around the department, to the branch master next season.
Ross says he's more self-safe now than he ever was at his player's process at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“ This was probably a real congress, ” he says about the period when he became a trainer of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work suited me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had fine incomes of it, and enjoyed good success.
But changes may be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still walk through stress and pressure from the work, but the training work seems simply to be right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do it; I have never felt better with myself in all my adult years.

The best time for beer is at 17.30 on Saturdays, according to an examination
For summers, the HAB has proved to be fantastic to a British bar in a bass, but increased pressure on restaurants.
Sales in puffs and baths increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business company, who collected the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and the unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed similar patterns as June, when the barsale increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The salan fell about 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, mainly on the sale of drinks, stood with a larger influence while restaurants went down.
Pubs that sold food were also difficult in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out to drink.
The sale of drinks in puffs and baths increased by 6.6 percent per month, but the food sale decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM diagnostic company, said: “These findings are the continuation of the fluctuation that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors in sales in outside home markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although sales increased to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful at the continued pressure due to costs.
This long and hot some could hardly come in a worse time for food adhesives, and only the time will reveal whether the temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in puffs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July, which reflects how the openings are possible.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the supervisor company with sales in the British puba bar and restaurant store, collects and discloses data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds, and is the sector industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of five children, up to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers, according to the results of a study.
An inspection that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in Insta’s “surface” pages
News have increased concerns about the publication of sexual matters
Twenty percent of students say they have "primary" accounts they show parents
One of five children, up to 11 years of age, creates secret accounts for social media that they keep secret to adults.
An inspection that reached 20,000 students showed a great increase in “insta” accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual matters.
Twenty percent of students said that they had a clean “primary” account to show parents, as well as a secret account.
One mother, who fell down on his 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a young one who encouraged others to “through me. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the private school manager (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years had two accounts and half of them recognized secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s anxiety that so many youths are tempted to create a network area where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of Sports" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected in the Scottish Athletics Committee as a commander without power at the annual general meeting of the government.
Doyle is the most successful free sports woman in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field last decade.
“Eilidh has great respect for sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a great deal of getting it in the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of sportsmen and hoping that I can put myself on the ground and help to continue sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who worked among ananrs 200 meters and 400 feet [200 m] on the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996, had a total of four Olympic Gold, and is now a regular visitor in BBC, was lamed after a transient transfusion.
He wrote on Twitter: “For one month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only the time would reveal whether I was balanced and how much.
This has been hard work, but I fully balanced, learned to walk again and to do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows causes disagreement on the network
A company that produces a breast pump is now addressed on the network because of advertising for milking mothers to milked cows.
The company Elvie published a useful advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump of the world that can be carried out outside, ” and the advertisement is inspired by music video tapes and should show the freedom that the new pump provides mothers with breasts.
Four real mothers dance in a hole full of hooks, and we have a song with texts such as: “Yes, I am milking myself, but you don’t see a straw on me,” and “If you did not notice, this is not the yoke, but my breasts. ”
The attachment continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the kids, pump, pump, pump milk from the irons. ”
However, the advertisement appearing on the Facebook site of the company has made a translation on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received different reactions from audiences, which tell many that it has a “crowsing ” resulting from the milk industry.
“ Really a bad decision to use cows to reveal this product.
Like we, they need to be calfful and bear to produce milk, except what the calfs are taken from them only a few days after their birth," said one word.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “It is difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them to reveal a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is totally disappearable at time. ”
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman acknowledged that the factor was “instant. ”
“ I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk from me.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertising that is directed to mothers pumping milk ( often at workplaces or inside clothes) and feels like “cows. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the female group shows that all of them were dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breast-catches.
The idea behind the reclame process is that many women say they feel like cows when pumping milk.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no virus or guides and fits comfortable above in a breast container that gives women freedom to move, hold their child and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a member of Mother’s boss, said: “The eleven pump is so revoltant warning that she deserve a prominent presentation that would bring about.
By comparing women we cows, we wanted to direct the castle light to breast pumping and all of her challenges, and even in a fun and knowledgeable way, showing how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has come into the news.
In the London fashion week, two children were presented to the designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrants in maintaining has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the borders monthly has remained the same.
The abortion parents have usually been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have feared that they will continue to be in danger in the country by offering themselves to a child’s birth.
The danger increased in June when the public authorities reported that possible abortion parents and other adults in the home would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigrant monitoring.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the immigration and customs supervision, witnessed before the Elderly Department and said that his organization had arrested a number of people who were seeking to foster single children.
The Foundation later confirmed that 70 percent of those who were arrested were not in charge.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are abortive parents or in the home of children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants in charge.
“That is why we continue to look for their individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the children’s matters, representatives reported new rules that require some of the children to come to court within a month of their observance, rather than after 60 days of the previous study, according to the staff working in the field.
Many of them will come through a video feast, rather than in their own personality, to prove their legal status before judges in immigrant matters.
The children who are judged incompatible to enter into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are kept, the more likely they are to become anxiety or depression, which can lead to a violent or refugee trial, according to the staff of the refugees and reports published by the system in the past months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger organization like in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice even though a child has a hard time, because of how many of them are.
So they added that the movement of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or greeting friends could increase the struggle that many of them are already having.
Syria says "American" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, foreign minister, also said in his speech at the General Assembly that the Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in their eighth year.
Moualem, also the role of a presidency minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false condition that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they are handled accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the assembly.
So Moualem firmly argued that “the war against terrorism was nearly finished ” in Syria, where more than 3300,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to conduct this holy struggle until we cleans all Syrian areas“ from both terrorist groups and all illegal foreigners. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both the Kurdish armies and the Syrian Arubs fighting the President of Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war - strangered country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough to return, and he taught “some western countries ” to“ spread out reasonless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on an international society and a humanitarian organization to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They make politics from something that should be merely humanity. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Erindresses say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major side of the opposition has created the opportunity to continue political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great attack from the Syrian armies strengthened by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “universal final reception” and declared the hope that war operations would be directed to Jihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front, which are connected to Al-Qaeda, and that they“ would be deleted. ”
Staffan de Mistura, Messenger S.D., is hoping to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to make a document for Syria after the war and to pay the street for elections.
Moualem sets conditions for the involvement of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to “passing the provisions of the current government, ” and warned against all interventions.
The reason Trump will work another electoral period
According to that reasoning, Mr Trump would work the reselections in 2020, unless accusation and annoyment ends to his presidential position, as many voluntary viewers are likely to hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the president’s asset ever! ”
Like audiences have no tiredness.
Since 2014, a view at the best time has doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost threefolds up to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show, ” has peaked a view of up to 3.5 million audiences in important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand," said Neal Baer, the member of the ABC dramatics “Designed Survivor” on the employee of the government, who will be president after the session is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, experienced writer and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another reason.
She remembers a trip to a taxi in Boston for the elections in 2016.
The taxi manager told her he wanted to choose Mr. Trump.
She asked.
“ He said, “because he makes me laugh, ” said Mrs. Scovell to me.
It's an entertainment value in the unclean.
However, in contrast to what is shown in the television, Washington’s stories may determine the destiny of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants can be united and the health of the international economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges can stop watching.
Yet, it is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time of the group of experts who reason the use of Bob Woodwards of “very close ” citizens for his book “Fear”, or $15,000 jackets from a bus leather dressed by Paul Manafort (“which is born with shock, ” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr Trump.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario's eyes again.
“The part of what he does is feel like reality, is that he gives you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the elements “Pawn Stars”, when he discussed the employee power in the show of Trumps and daily changes in history (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and praise in Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you can lose your desire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees of heat and sunshine were outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he kept inside and watched MSNB while he took up CNN.
He was not able to dismiss himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to witness before the court committee of the Senior Board, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“ I remember when we were creating all these crazy factors in old times, and people said, “this is the beginning of the end of Western cultures,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought this was some kind of joke, but I found that people were right. ”

Money Outdoors in the Nearest Choices of the Mediterranean
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania electoral region sees the money flow to it, thanks to the reorganization of the selection areas that led to two representatives to compete on the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg region sends forward to the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another electoral area in the last summer's special elections.
Lamb offers himself to another representative, Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the 12 - year - old choir territory in Pennsylvania, who is much different from the new 17 - choir area.
The cards over the fields were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old electoral areas were organized in the interests of the rebellions and that they were inflicted against the government record.
The race in the new 17th electoral area has been launched in the financing of electoral campaigns between the main funders of both classes, the DCCC and the NRCCs.
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a few triumphs in the special elections in March before the 18th electoral area in Pennsylvania, but many followed them.
The republikum had previously worsened the seat for over decades, and the president of Donald Trump, held a victory in the electoral area with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a little preliminary.
The United States intended to punish El Salvador for support for China, but then stopped.
Employers noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Peking, with little protests from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and visited a hotel in Panama until the owners of the Trump Constituent Management Team disappeared.
Representatives of the Foreign Ministry decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominic Republic, and Panama for “a new decision to no longer accept the Tévan, ” said Heather Nauert, the Council’s statement in early this month.
However, punishments were only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for assistance in 2017, including drug monitoring, development work, and financial support.
The reimbursements which were made and included financial support reductions and restrictions on the release of dwelling permits would have been painful for the Central American, where there is a high level of unemployment and mortality.
As the internal meetings continued, American and Central American representatives postponed the Security and Economic Success Conference and were supposed to follow a similar meeting held in the past and considered steps to prevent people from moving to the United States.
In the middle of September, however, representatives from the upper ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all disadvantages of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, president of the presidency, is now to address the conference, which is to be held in the middle of October, as a sign of the importance of the government’s views, declared the recorders.
The three American messengers also returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Judean Republic, with no new hard message or punishments from Washington.
The speaker of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the negotiations described by the three American representatives, including two immigrants, who agreed to discuss the negotiations against being nameless.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who is working closely with the government and also spoke about the issue against anonymity.
Learn the History
The next case could be Roberts Mueller, a special prosecutor, report on the possible actions of Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but there are many official proofs for that accusation.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turned his study about whether Mr Trumps had worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the plenary is governed by another class, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his chiefs again, and maybe his companions have been ordered to be abdomened.
However, this is very uncertain, and I would not like to mention that Trump's fall is untworn, nor his colleague's fall in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German councils were prepared to rob Hitler, only if western countries had given him a contradictory and supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the disaster years followed.
The story turns around such important points and speeds or ceases for the unending progress of democracy.
The United States now faces some such important points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump runs the state accusator Rod Rosenstein, the man who deals with Mr. Mueller's desolate investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that he had proposed to make secret records of the president and discussed whether he was inappropriate in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the news of the Times is not right.
“ How will we respond if the newly requested FBI study at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or fair, or if it is confirmed in the court office of the Supreme Judge despite religious accusations of sexual reliance and dishonesty?
And above all, will we choose a meeting in the mid-term period that will give Mr. Trump axle responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, the democratic talk will have to be tired of a long winter.
But I think we won't fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that was before sitting in my missionary house.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to turn on the Sabbath cables on the table with the cockpit.
With such an inheritance, how can I see only positive eyes for our future?

Graham Dorrans, agent Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the European Department's G group. Rangers made a fantastic counterfeit in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Measures on the knee prevented the central guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the playtime before in the game against Villareal that ended with 2-2 equals, but he believes that Rangers can use the ideas as a bounceboard for better success.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for Villarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one point.
Perhaps we had been able to achieve victory at the end, but in general, there was probably a fair view.
They probably were better in the first half of the game, and we came strongly into the second half of the game and played better.
On Thursday, there is another important evening for the European Department.
Hopefully, we can reach three points, but it will be a hard game because they went well in their last game, but with audiences that support us, I am sure that we endure and have a positive viewpoint.
The last year was difficult, both because of my harm and the changes made in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can get further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing pay savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to care for it, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the National Wide Study said that they talked to their spouse about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they were talking to their children.
“ People want a family member to care for it, but it does not take the right steps to have these conversations, ” said Holly Snyder, Head of Supervisor of the National Security Department.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your mate and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you do not make your desires light with a good warning.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care of, because these options can change much of the cost.
Introduce your financial consultant: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance paid in cash, to help pay costs, or self-security with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Give a healthcare officer so that you can designate someone you trust to supervise your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals are going to your wishes if you cannot express them directly.
Consider, too, to get a procuraaf for your financial matters.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older father or mother is in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergics?
Give this information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It is not just about the financial matters but also who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“Who are the medicines?
Who will watch the dog?
"Please make the plan ready."

At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected to speak the dead will increase.
Since all communications are down, helpers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, a region north of Pala, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were deceased to leave their homes in Pala after the accident was over.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donggla, on the island of Sulawesi:
Pala is the capital of the central Sulawesi district and is located for the bottom of a strain flood on the west coast of the Sulawesi island. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379.800 in 2017.

Nickel studies are also important in the province, but most of them are in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi.
The Pala and Donggala, according to the Indonesian disaster organ, have been invaded several times in the last century.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood bubble was swallowed and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, in the western part of Donggla, nine were killed.

Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former president of Alaska and president Prosecutor, has been arrested for an accusation of body attack.
Palin, 29 - year - old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for a suspicion of domestic violence, trying to prevent a report of domestic violence and to fight against arrest, according to a report from the Alaskan police, published on Saturday.
According to the police’s report, Palin took the phone of her friend when she tried to call the police to report a mistreatment.
Palin is held in the Mat-Su station where he is waiting for a hearing, and he is held against 500 dollar insurance, according to KTUU's news.

He has also been accused of crime in class B, who is punished with one day in prison and $2 000 incurred.
This isn't the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the meant attack.
The issue is now being treated for the charter warrant in Alaska.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
Insurers in New York want death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected to have participated in a terror attack in New York City, which became the death of eight men. This is rare punishment that has not been applied in the district for a violation of state law since it was in 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was considered to have taken a Home Depot truck on a rental to attack people on a wheelchair along the street West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down the walking and biking roadmen in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the chargers must prove that Saipov killed the victims of eight “willing ” and caused serious body acts“ willingly, ” according to the willing declaration of applying a death penalty, recorded in the Southern District Court of New York.
Both of these accused ones can lead to possible death penalties, according to the prosecution.
A number of weeks after the attack, Saipov’s State Court accused in 22 teams, including eight accusations for murder for a criminal purpose, usually used by prosecutors in charge of organised crime organizations, and Saipov was also charged for violence and for the destruction of the car.
The attack included “a considerable plan, ” declaring Sapiov’s act as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was exerted to physical damage, damage and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the willing statement.
The five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been a decade since Southern New York, the last death trial was to be treated.
The prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug deals, but was finally sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a court case in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were taken to life after being accused of pursuing the Soviet spies in the cold war two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electrical chair on June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told a research officer that he did well what he had done, said a policeman.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching the ISIS videos in his phone, according to what is said in the accusation.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said a policeman.
He has declared his innocentness in all 22 members of the accusation.
David Patton, one of the official defenders of Saipov, said that they were “naturally disappointed ” with the decision of the accusation.
“ We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a debt statement against lifetime prison without the possibility of an experience, will only extend the stroke for all participants, ” said Patton.
Saipov's warrants had previously asked a prosecutor to not seek a death penalty.
The Consultant of the Consumer Group says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct a Brexit agreement.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the army of the people ” today in protest to the Consultant Group.
This former leader Ukip said that politicians would be “come under pressure” from EU doubters at the same time as one of the Chairmen of Theresa May suggested that he should conduct the negotiations with the EU.
The maintainer Peter Bone told the protester in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain would be “out ” now.
However, May’s challenge to make a deep disagreement between its own members was even more evident in the fact that inhabitants who wish to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty in keeping its Chequers plan on the right path and is critical of those who are rejected by Brexit, those who are opposed to it, and the EU.
The Americans claimed that she will continue to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Working Party to choose between her plans and “unclearness. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Reconciliation Officer Leave in Solihul that he would “take away from the Chequer’s plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been involved and shoulder responsibility for agreements with Brussels.
“ If he was at the government, we would be out now, ” he said.
The Senate from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequer’s plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone pointed out that the public’s opinion had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that British public has changed the view and desire to remain is absolutely unfair. ”
Andrea Jenkyns, a persistent supporter of Brexit, was also in the protest and said to the newspapers: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer’s plan is enthusiastic among the public, and the opposition will not choose with it, and it uses enthusiasms among our classes and actors who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “Presidents keep their work when they meet their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel pressure ” if they were to disappear the decision taken after the vote in 2016.
“ This is about confidence between our people and our political class, ” he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them "We won't let you get up with this."
In his message to the crowd, he added: “I want you to let your political class, which is about to be disappeared from Brexit, feel pressure.
We operate the army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become independent, autonomous, proud Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest in Birmingham, which completed a two - time protest meeting in the central city.
A small group of actors weaved the flags of inhabitants against Brexit after the group was set up during the weekend.
Adonis, a lawyer from the Working Party, made a joke for security problems that occurred in the class’s telephone program when the conference was opened.
“ This is the people who tell us that it can have all computer systems and all technology for Canada plus, for a border without barriers, for free business with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ This is an absolute harmful thing.
There's nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.
Warren intends to “consider seriously” to offer himself to the president's office.
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Chairman of the Deputy, says that after the elections in November, he is going to “consider serious procurement to the Presidential Office. ”

Warren, who has unusually criticized the President of the United States of Donald Trump, is offering for re-choosing in November against the rebellor Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump's election trip in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been the center of neglecting that she could offer himself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke afternoon on Saturday was 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with inhabitants in her headquarters, since Trump took office.
One attended at the meeting asked her if she was planning to offer herself to president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and set up our government, and then also a woman as a leader. ”

Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Mastership after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory after order from their teams.
It was evident from Valtteri Botta's seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at the start of Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a great part in the race.
Bottas received a good start, leaving Hamilton nearly as he was guarding his position in the first two curves and invited Vettel to fight his teammates.
Vettel went first to the grave and let Hamilton run into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to make decisions.
The Mercedes car went into the grave one circle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out of after a near conflict where Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after the risk of being left, after the defence attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the group and was in the seventh seat at the end of the first circle, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he stopped switching the deck to try to finish quickly and go out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach a fourth seat.
Finally, he went into the grave in the 44th circle, but could not increase the speed in the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a hard day, because Valtteri stood beautiful all the weekend and was a real lord to let me go.
The team has been awesome to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
This was really bad physical expression
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made a joke to the senior minister Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because she claimed that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation to the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge, on sexual claim.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly the witness from Ford to the Board of Appeal, instead of saying that what is happening in the Senatorial Assembly showed that people were “bad and cruel and unfair. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the elderly department, when you see the anger, when you see people who are wrathful and bad and cruel and unlikely, ” he said.
“ When a man sees the shows and the leaks and then tells them, “Oh, I did not.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you luck this?
Remember her reply... did you read the document - “Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't luck it."
Just wait slowly.
Let's... no, we don't laugh," he said and strangered the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, so early in September, Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“ I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t finish her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to the report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it in faith, and I did as she asked me. ”
But her denial seemed not to go well down in the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you that, this was really bad physical expression.
Maybe she didn't do anything, but this was the worst body support I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of the sexual incentive of three women, and suggested that democrats would benefit from their accusations.
“ They are determined to regain, regardless of what ways to do.
You see the cruelty, the evil, the ones who don't care who they hurt, who they need to choose to take control and rule," said the president, according to the mediaite news.

An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors closed their speech in a reconciliation against a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.

Although Paddington had been a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."

I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.

Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have made a message on the bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and telephone numbers that people can call and receive help.

The future of Bretts Kavanaughs hangs on intravenous threads when the FBI has his investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - with a limited time and range - we might have a little agreement," said Mr Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was “to be broken” in the middle of a disagreement between the classes where everything was in the back.
Why wouldn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the republic class want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their treachery is because of the time.
The median seasons remain only five weeks, November 6, which, as expected, weakens their serious attempts to get his husband chosen to sit in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the senior assemblies to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met her wife Ashley through him, who was a secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI shows his research report?
Holdin will be a vote in the assembly of the elderly, where 51 republics and 49 democrats are sitting as they are.
It is still not possible that Mr. Kavanaugh may have at least 50 votes at the Board of Elders, but that would allow Mike Pence's vice president to break up the balcony and confirm it in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of those flying North Korea 'Decreases' under Kim's control
The number of those flying North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-suge, quoted data from the South Korean Association Council and said that 1127 people had escaped last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that more stringent border warranty between North Korea and China and higher fees crushed by people were key elements.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The majority of those flying North Korea are invited to receive the South Korean Citizen Court.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 inhabitants of North Korea were illegally crossing the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them are flying to China, but they have the longest borders of North Korea, and it is easier to cross them, rather than the well-being of a neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to the homeland.
Communication between North and South Korea, still in war, has improved considerably the last month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for discussions that were mainly about deferred agreements on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, where they agreed to work together toward a nuclear crop of Korea.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, foreign minister of North Korea, taught American traders about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty of the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first, ” said Ri in his speech at the SD General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “the mother-sick” and says he is unable to carry out the work of the Supreme Judge
Nancy Pelosi, the ministerial leader of the assembly, called Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge, “made sick ” and told him too bold to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words falling at a interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t think that if a woman ever had been like that, she would have been called mother - sick, ” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh to the decision - making committee of the Elders’ department on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the excuse that he had put Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on a sexual basis when they were both adolescents.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes nearly threw up crying, and he got a knock in his neck when he discussed his family and his school years.
Also, he officially condemned democrats in the committee and called the accusations on his hands “incredible and organized murder of men who had been organized by free-minded men who were wrathed that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not operate at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clinton couple and democratic show that he is inappropriate to the work," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh disfellowshipped if he was confirmed and if democrats reached the majority of the assembly.
“ I'll say this: if he's not telling the plenary or the FBI the truth, he's not only incompatible to be in the highest court, but also in the right he is now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the prosecution law in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was worried about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Health Law of Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a persistent judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away questions about whether he would turn about certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a mother - sick, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, “this is wonderful. ” Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
This is a fair speech, months, and years of flooding up, so it does not come from her without crying.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I think it's not uncommon, but you?"
She continued: “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, saying that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began crying, she said to her interviewer: “You maybe think I am so sorry that I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just continued to cry.
And I thought it was great."
Thoughts are allowed to express wrath in part because they are misunderstanding in basic terms.
One of my most clear memories from the previous work I had in a office with men in most, where I began to cry out of an indignation that I could not express, came to an older woman and took my throat killer, who was a cold chief who I had always feared a little, and she pulled me into a walk.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know that you're insane.
They believe that you are sorrow, and they rejoice that they have come into thee.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was a president, then she was a congressor of the Democrats from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was engaged in a survival on board in a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled her offer back, Mrs Schroeder, thought that there was no reason why she could not intend to offer herself to the president.
“ This was not a well - thought decision, ” she laughed me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other suppliers, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name “Mill white and the seven dwarfs.”
As long as the electoral process was over, she was on the other hand in terms of funding, so she promised not to offer herself unless she could collect 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“ Do they think I'm going to be disfellowshipped? ” she wondered.
When she brought her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overcome by feelings - thankfulness to the people who had supported her, wrath against the system, which made it so difficult to obtain money and direct her sights to the electoral instead of representatives, and anger out into the sexual discrimination - that she broke in cry.
“ I might have had a nervous attack, ” said Miss Schroeder, when she remembers how media responded.
“ I could think that Kleenex was my supporter.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my leg?
"She cried?"
The reason why business war between the United States and China could be good for Peking
The first shot in the trade war between the United States and China was arrogant, and although the war is far from the end, between countries may be favourable for Beijing for a long time, says experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by putting tax on the major exports of China, including sunloads, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s largest score came with new duties that overcome goods worth $200 billion, $150 billion, and tax as well as half of all lips imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has replied in the same coin every time and has recently paid $60 billion to $5 to 10 percent on American goods.
China has promised to respond to the customs adjustment of the United States, and it is unlikely that another largest economy of the world will be released.
In order to get Washington to hop, he needs to leave the requirements, but it would be too degrading for Xi Jinping, president of China to turn himself publicly from the United States.
Yet, experts say that if Peking holds the right on the games, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need for both businesses.
“ The fact that either in Washington or in Beijing a rapid political decision could lead to the circumstances that lead to economic crises in one country is actually far more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized, ” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing mainly on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria “prepared ” for refugees to return, says a foreign minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country would improve.
“ Today, the state of the earth is more stable and safe, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to come in normal situations by building up areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic decisions that meant against their daily life and work.
SS estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million additional people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to receive help to rebuild the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept the help of the nations that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the cup of Ryder in Paris
Europe has worked the Clearer Beaker 2018 by defeating the United States team with the final results of 16.5 versus 10,5 levels in the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on a European basis and has not won Ryder beakers in Europe since 1993.
Europe again reached the crown when the team, under the leadership of Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14,5 steps needed to conquer the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had most problems with all the races, hit his initial hit into the water on a 16th hole, a pair of 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined sharply in all its games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the conclusions from the start of the race using their current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn O read from Denmark, which was in the lower seat in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, on the top of the list of best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possible in his last race about the Ryder Becker.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder Beaker, became the most victorious European racer with 25.5 degrees of career.
“ Usually, I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
This has been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomasi to have chosen me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the beaker back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He justified his lands, John Rahm, but he defeated the American Gulf Divine Legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in a single game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud of the victory of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race about the Ryder beaker.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who have won 14 large titles and is only in the second seat after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had hard to find himself in the field all weekends, besides Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game through all the races.
The leader of the United States, Jim Furyk, said with disappointment, “I am proud of them, they struggled.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take up for Thomasi.
He's a great agent.
Every 12 of his players play very well.
We'll come back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States and the name Ryder of the beaker, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud of being their leader.
You gotta get out of here.
They played better than us."
