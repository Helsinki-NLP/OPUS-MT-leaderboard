Prague's exchange crashes against business conclusion into minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Exchange could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day business.
The Prague Börse just started on Tuesday business at the inbreak of Monday when it fell by six more percentage points.
This time the reason for the invasion on the Wall Street was laid.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case experienced the shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices could compensate for some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Song Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later a part of the losses could compete, thus reducing to approximately 2.5 percent.
The Index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stocks on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchanges in Taiwan decreased by 3.6 per cent after the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the United States is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," says the Chief of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
The American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to the words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the invasion.
A blood bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion Kč) should be used.
The lawyers thus ignored the call by President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the most important share indices reported the biggest invasion in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by almost seven percent, a similar invasion he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly signs that the draft would not pass through in the parliamentary House, the index experienced a free case.
Congress concessions: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The Supreme Representatives of the American Convention and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote is to be taken at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system at a amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 billion kroner).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The congress members must negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final text of the law.
The plan for supporting the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank said that.
In the Senate, different information is likely to be voted on the plan early on Wednesday.
Economies believe that a communication that the plan is adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for the relevance of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "reduction" due to the complex mechanisms, which could help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a significant progress.
We have explained our different views on how a package to stabilize the market should look," said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Agency Bloomberg.
According to their words, it could still come to a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in the night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of incurred mortgage assets from financial corporations, which interfere with serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective on the market.
You need to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis also strikes significantly in the share markets that fall strongly.
The words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, said the lawyers were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
This is why we want to rest the investors before businesses on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect the businesses on Monday.
But so far, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but it is also unclear whether the negotiations in the last minute could still fail to have a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
But the law will experience some changes.
The total amount to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, the congress can block the amount of the money left if it has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, at $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the congress can overcome its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remained, which was based on the acquisition of financial resources for the purchase of poor hypothesis securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their hypotheses.
"We've worked out everything.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday," says the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
With the progress, the American President Bush was also satisfied.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the mutual efforts to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Restriction of golden fallscreens
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the executive subcontractor, claimed that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden case screens for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee which is intended to supervise the Funds.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their hypothesis.
The government should negotiate new rates in the case of hypotheses that buy them, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs of the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That is because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," Marek said this week to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or in the beginning of the next week, Mareks considers that it is not essential.
"The more important it is that the congress members agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to an adoption is at this moment the most important," Marek stressed.
Duell on knives cutting: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We advise you when you choose
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet phone.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy yourself just a phone.
In spite of all, there are enough reasons why you should play an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the nature of use and claims to future owners.
Surely, one buys a fantastic, expensive recorder at home to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative viewpoint there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the hall, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also simplified with the music on trips, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kroner, but likewise a Pink Floyd fan may be hardly raising headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for each one.
The selection is widespread.
The lifetime of batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even create breathtaking ways.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the simsen, it can play music and videos, take both, it has one better, even a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still involve the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a little computer in your bag.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often, however, you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy foods.
Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (in particular the simplest) are clearly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones that they can not play music more than a few hours.
If you then call at times, you would prefer to buy for security another charger for the office - this also applies to expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good holds at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with once charge.
Another problem then exists if you want to overplay the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB closure, and no mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly on a storage medium, but only few card readers will be done without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
In players you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players have a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices form only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should examine, in particular, after the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the user comfort.
Is music especially for you and hear them every day just shortly in the roadway, then a arbitrary phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really can be almost every phone.
You don't have to control the music formats that a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 creates all, and most music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service may already be a striking argument for why you should have a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is mainly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
Generally, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (which it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will be governed by the music industry in the future.
The phone's wearing most.
If you like to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it concerns whether you carry a wireless free speech device with your headphones or at least a wireless free-speaking device.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 players.
The most likely advantage of the music manuals will be in price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand kroner.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very pleasant Walkman.
The biggest disability will be for most people that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically mature telephones with a 3,5-mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand kroner.
The advantage of the player is in the light operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of a wrongly employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrible account for data transmissions.
What device should you now take?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But respect.
Base models are usually only supported cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB storage cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) then you do not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
Belong to the more demanding listeners, please take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the power comfort is thus approached to one of the MP3 players.
The most widest is here Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individual sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this one will not wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers are working for the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTU, who made aware that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming fees, it is likely that there is a paradox situation - for some clients of the Czech mobile phone providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How is it that the prices in Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradox, in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile providers are pleased to say that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTU) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often said that there was no room for another provider in Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with a own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (on the other hand, he would probably find no more frequencies).
However, there is another option - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which then also had to respond to the classic mobile providers.
There were still similar votes on the market in Britain before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile arrived in the UK as in Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is space for such providers and that they can really be successful.
On the other hand, you do not need to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In only half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the five-largest supplier of the country.
At the back of Mobilking, the Penta Finance Group, which has in the Czech Republic, among other things, U:phone.
The advantage of virtual providers is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually profiled as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMSs, which are often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than his competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite good to move to a non-clean target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Eigen guys choose Mobilking - the provider that they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
Hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take foot in Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the view of the service offer."
In Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile providers mean
But it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile provider acquires Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
It is more likely to come to a market entrance from Mobilking to other countries of our region," says a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile mobile providers in Czech Republic are not particularly concerned with this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything for no potential competitor.
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile mobile provider has long been showing the GTS Novera group, who wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business customers sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiations progress," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times come now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an unoverlapable wall of silence.
"On this moment we do not assume that in Czech Republic there is space for a full-quality virtual provider.
The Czech market has great specificity compared to other markets.
Until now, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeć from the Telefónica O2 press department.
The specificity of the Czech market also points to other suppliers.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds, in a rare manner, to the O2-explanation: "We have not yet found a viable and both-sided advantageous project that could be constructed on."
And she adds: "In the T-Mobile network, no virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we must have had a specific offer in order to be able to think so short-term."
Vodafone is rather focused on the fulfilment of the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is just what we consider from the view of the customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to look for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider has more competition, which would result in lower prices and thus also in a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate the entry into the market?
That the providers can draw on a strike when it comes to something, the long way forward and here for the development of U:fon.
The most likely strong pressure towards ČTU was at the time when U:phone came to the market from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates publicly accessible information from the ČTU websites.
Now, however, U:fon is just suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disagreement of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which, unfortunately, in Czech countries, in contrast to the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It only has the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, was referring to this whole problem, its very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile mobile provider would then be possible after a contract concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers", so in his answer to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of ÚOHS.
The representatives of the suppliers would not surprise such a formulation.
This is more than considerable by an authority to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work very normally, it is observed that their market entrance has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction is probably not part of the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, truly shocking is the almost already touching conformity of the three mobile providers, which are resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is on the hand.
Just as the absolutely the same benzene price at the tank stations is certainly only an accident and the result of a hard competition struggle.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate any action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
No one of the providers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTU, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
Of course, no one of the Czech mobile providers has a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, it is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile provider has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that it will necessarily take a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile providers are similar.
The complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the said company GTS Novera) prove that they are faced with very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The responsibility of the ČTU is then a very common trick in telecommunications services, which distinguishes the UOHS from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted novels of the telecommunications law, the extension of the competences of the ČTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been succeeded, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must only be known to the representatives of the UOHS, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one looks at it.
Unobserved, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are a number of in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies who spend their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Normally, it is companies that act in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, your own mobile phone services provide Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to selectors.
The sense of the case is that the company appears to be a classic company company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he receives special prices (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar type of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then work on what can lead to a discontinuation of cooperation with the appropriate society," answered Martina Kemrová on our question about this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing is not talking around with the operators of the mobile telephony providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, from the activities of these companies, they are not to negligible profits, while, in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepický notes: "The law allows such speculations, despite all, these companies' services are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not running on their name, so they cannot fully have it like the normal customers of the mobile providers."
But this alone, the ČTU would have to be at least strange.
In addition, another question is raised for the UOHS.
The mobile providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has a very strong competence to detect such activities, and if it does not want, it must not be satisfied with the declaration by the suppliers that they do not know anything about it and their conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has been highlighted several times, the entry into the market of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction in the various services.
In practical terms, in all countries where virtual providers have developed, classical providers have tried to prevent their origin virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, just in these moments, the regulatory bodies, which did not try to preserve the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are all like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot eliminate the impression that unclearness in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is voting and soon appears to a virtual provider, the Czech mobile market may soon be in motion.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it is about rejecting other stakeholders (discriminating).
And then the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my homeland at the time of the day of the Czech state.
The Hymne was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir collection and in a instrumental version.
The song statement took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already earlier, he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers for the solo variants with young representative voices that are marked and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried both and then with the choir to keep a clear thickness so that you can understand the text well so that there is a consensus," says the dirigent.
The Czech National Hymne will be the 175th anniversary next year.
The Song Kde domov m. .J. first heard in 1834 on the stage of the St. Theater in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka from Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first stroke of the song then became an organic part of the National Hymne after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols also remained after the creation of the separate Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" Hymne
Prague's transportation on Wednesday, also on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers, instead of a paper driving licence, enter an e-coupon in the bag.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the chip card opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day coupon or an annual coupon (not valid from 1 January 2009) and be able to play it on their chip card at the same time, at the info centres and branches of the transport operations at the Muzeum, M
The coupons have been available on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used until the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the U-Bahn stations, where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper driving licences.
They buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, the traveller is also available for a switch with a trained staff who advises interested parties on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-control machines on the opencards, which are fitted in some U-Bahn-Vestibülen.
How do such machines look?
They're red, remember driving licence operators, the passengers may already have noticed in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrny adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the automates that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays up from yourself.
The electronic coupons apply not only from tomorrow in the capital but also in the surroundings.
So in the pre-town trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, which mainly reach the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of central trees into the capital.
"In the trains belonging to Prague's integrated traffic, train consulars have readers with which they can check the duration of coupons by time and zone," explains Philip Drápal from the Ropid organisation the driving licence control. This organisation comprises the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The pre-town buses have card readers on the box at the driver.
When the chip card is incurred, not only must the driver be shown, but the open card should be placed at a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
"Will a passenger check the validity of the played coupons, nothing easier than the driver asks for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with pre-town buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends, can go to the self-control machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents will be shown on the display of the device.
The Sudetens demanded a national decision by the United States
In 1945 the Sudetenduts had sought to join the Bohemian Forest in the United States.
This is shown in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least want to live under the government of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudetdeutschen were supposed to have turned to the US presidents.
This is evident from a letter that has been retained in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President to not allow the return of the "Sudetenguus" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering as a oppressor and enemies of German territory, but as a liberator," it says in a letter signed with the words "Men whose fate is at the heart of the Sudedes".
Since the connection to the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetdeuts - in the light of the Czech national charter - suspect that they would expect brutality, unconsciousness, unconsciousness, oppression and slavery, the writers of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection rule of the Bohemian Forest for this time and forever.
"We cannot believe that without considering the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state to us, who is underpressing and trying to eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is, accordingly, the fear of revenge of the "Tsjechian oppressors".
If the U.S. president doubts the minds of the Bohemian Forests, it is sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in the Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or under the United States' protection rule.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive in today's knowledge of the after-war history, he considers that some time witnesses have a good picture of the expectations of the Sudetends.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would negotiate their departure from the Republic, only few of them were able to accept such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the sudden.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in war as Budviser Germaner at the Marine at the East Sea.
When he came into British prison at the end of the war and was brought him into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to them," said Chalupa.
None of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that he would be dispatched from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decree.
You don't think - then pay!
A emotionally invited campaign is directed to drivers
The most expensive action to secure the roads in Czech history.
Similarly, the emotionally invited media campaign was characterized, which the Transport Ministry wants to start on Wednesday.
The Ministry of Minister Aleš
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, in the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to bring the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol to the tax.
And they also remind them to be caught before driving.
The campaign wants to speak to conscience young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
Of this, the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also proves:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "think not" are in uppercase letters on a sign sign.
And in a blood laughter, then the word "pay".
This means that you can pay a moment of unnoticableness with your own life.
The spots will shock the viewers by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo Saxony countries, where normal pictures can be seen with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads are so lower.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peitsche for the drivers
"For the drivers the motto sugar bread and peitsche is valid.
Sugar bread means they save time when they, for example, drive at red.
The peitsche is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And therefore, information campaigns in the press and above all negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his view, less effective are tables that make the drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon flood with the environment, and the drivers will no longer observe them," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert has spoken for the return of practically all the areas that were occupied in 1967, i.e. the Jordanland, Eastjerusalem and the Golan hills, when peace could be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed on Monday by the day newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israelian territory) because there will not be peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would also include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to go away from a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in play on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens were hurt.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the templeberries and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Departure from the Golan hills
Olmert spoke for a departure of Israel from the Golan hills, which is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan hills," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians know just too well what they need to avoid to get back the Golan hills.
They will need to avoid their current relationship with Iran; they will need to avoid their relationship with (Shitish) Hisbolah movement; they will have to avoid the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (Shitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida Terror Network and the Djihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know it, in a remote bus it is not allowed to run around
In the context of the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travellers are allowed to run on the bus while travelling.
"If we would strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is opposed to the law on road transport", says the speaker of the Carel Hanzelka Transport Ministry.
The accident at which a two and twenty-year-old Stewardes died last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment to all the accidents next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or sharp braking, where the Steward has coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with steering positions after the vehicle letter.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travellers must sit.
Student's ferry buses have no stations; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has first failed to agree to the movement of travelers.
Later, this has been taken back, and we have reached a consensus that the travellers may go to the toilet when they have their seat," he shared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no legal regulation which prohibits the carrier to provide services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle accompanying; however, its rights and duties do not define it," the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Joseph Pokorný believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It's about whether the bus has positions in the product permit.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are subdivided in urban buses where there are stables and the maximum speed is limited, near-way buses with steering stations and a higher speed and distance buses without stops with the highest speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP coach for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no basic problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid way, not many dangers are threatened, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulencies come, and the Stewardess can hit the head."
"When a bus is sharp, then naturally the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must be cleared by internal rules," he also says that this problem is not completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to strike the services
Student Agency offers services from Stewards as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider its occupation even after the accident to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of Steward is risky, I will strike it.
Coffee and newspapers can get the travellers when they enter.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewards, but we've been rejecting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with any fatal accident," he had not expressed a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the region of Pilsen was unhappy, which had worked two years for society.
The Slovenian truck was probably without blinking off the standing strip and had blocked the bus.
The bus driver tried to wake out by a sharp manover, but collided with the right advantage with the truck.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura argues.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to complain about truck drivers.
With a remuneration for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judicial judgment, but it expects a financial compensation from the guilty sides.
A change in law?
Not visible
A more precise regulation on the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation where a 30-heading expert team of the Transport Ministry has been working over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB Board does not lack to the staff of the House.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" could be created in the letter known on Monday.
The WestLB broke a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further associations in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads if a board wants to demonstrate activity in a difficult time.
For the WestLB is still under huge pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services, which has recently made the Nordrhein-West-Falish Government clear that the time is pressing to find a future solution.
The WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has told us when presenting the half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see any meaning.
However, the Deka Management Board, which is carried for half of the national banks and spare banking associations, has ordered the Board to talk to the WestLB about joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts thereof.
The discussions have been freely started, so it says at the financial place, just before.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt financial site with its 3000 employees, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the spare banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed like the Deka Bank could merge with the Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba country bank for a moment.
However, there was nothing from this three-band.
Nearly the plans had become public, the Hessian government expressed itself against the participation of the Helaba.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been always thought games about a link between the Deka banks and national banks.
At last, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba, had spoken against plan games about a association with his house.
Indeed, however, the knowledge seems to mature that a merge of the various houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the country-day election is over in Bayern, the BayernLB could first become closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, you'll go out and go to the partners for it.
In the south, she would only be Junior partner, although it has been much better through the financial crisis until now than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A convergence with the West LB again, the spare- and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent in Helaba, has set a riel in the beginning of the year.
At all, stay the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of each house fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question about the business model to ensure the future ability of the national banks was not answered by the German spare bank and Giroverband.
At the end, there could also be a destruction of the West LB, but it is not in itself desirable.
This is the case in the letter of the Board of Directors that it is in any case a "total solution" for the House.
As it is possible to bring individual units to the Deka Bank under a hat, it will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena as his girlfriend is with it, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bier phase of the brand Emperor, stands a massively built burrower and proves the approximately 200 October festival travelers, the deep sounds of his throat can produce.
Elena's gonna give Luca a clap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova railway station, start four buses this evening at 23.45 a.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are especially reserved for the Italians, traveling only Brazilians in a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that this is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate feed and a brilliant with wide silver bearings, is one of the buses.
For five years, they've been going to the October festival, three tours are alone this year.
Night, every day on the wheat, back at 22.30.
Nights would only mean unnecessary foods, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with emperor beer, broke the bayer's purity offer, the hospital insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll in the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and wooden churches, there are several other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half seven o'clock in the early season, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: Put the yellow stick.
On the left, "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, the Internet address of Marco's Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer, it means running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Lop!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all of the yellow mowers on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, breaks Marco, costs EUR 8.25.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officer shows that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirdly, "Find up half 11 here today's evening!" understanded?
And it's going to be a little bit.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as road marks to the trees, to signs, and even to the election poster of a large Bayerian people party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It is the second wheezing weekly, known as "Italian weekly."
There is no precise information about figures; the speech is of 50 000 who are on the way across the Alps and fall into the beer cells, 10 percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Münchner Police is strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bayer Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics in which the Italians pre-British (approximately 60 bets) and Austrians (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical careers have the first place.
The court is particularly popular in Italians.
Sleepless Nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, underlined Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good the politician used the word "relational" and also affects the fact that the German banking sector is not saved from the crisis developments.
For it has now entered in the weekend.
The Coinchner real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion loans from a German bank consortium to shield from the turbulencies on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit aids amounted to up to EUR 35 billion.
The hypo Real Estate must only interest the part that it also takes.
The money comes from private and public banks.
Background is losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which it was granted money, the government financer had refined itself extremely short-termly - which is no longer possible because of distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had easily surrounded from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, which decreased revenue from loans to claims and certain securities, and the settlement of deposits in the credit business by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher earnings from reimbursements of post-payment costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interests in accordance with the order of levy and the business provision for group companies, the revenue minus had remained moderate by about 16 per cent.
The former government financer had first speculated after its privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate credits which had then been distributed into the Aareal Bank.
Since the classical government funding was too low, Depfa had then reinforced its involvement in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "real material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
She had been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major government and infrastructure funder since Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market, as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brother's two weeks ago, the credit grants among the banks have been widely decorated as the banks heard their liquidity.
The hypo Real Estate needs annually short-term funding for a part - about EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolio.
According to the hypo Real Estate communication, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan at an expensive time and the company is protected from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets.
Other sources are to hear that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets at an expensive time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the Bank to hope.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unlikely that funding does not need to be fully applied.
But even the opposite is not to be eliminated.
After the event after the bank was still before the insolvency on the late Sunday evening, at least provisional salvation could not calm down the moisturs.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
However, the loan rates are fairly well maintained.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of the retrospective loans are more clearly reflected.
Especially the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the courses beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate loans were previously a speculative investment alternative, their valuability must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the significant increase in the banking crisis and the institution itself.
As long as the banks of notes, governments and less affected business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a periodic retirement of pensions can be assumed.
Or that is what does not expect anybody to hope at present - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the communications overlapping with the state of the country, there is currently only a legitimate hope from the probability of security.
In particular, it is likely that long-term believers will prepare some sleepless nights with the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a final point to form a loss lecture for future payments of charge on rate gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 on the first day of school at the Tachibana high school, the girls start to look: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before the schoolroad, I had bamboo.
I live on the edge of Tokios towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana high school.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't walk.
The teaching start does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony.
The students beat in from 8:00 a.m. until about 20 a.m. a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson began, I was in the row to imagine.
I am not the guy who likes to talk to people, nor a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I dressed an old rock of my guest mother, thereby blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator, I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started to learn the language for about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all touched, cooked and won and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'needful, sweet'.
And then I'd be hooked up in my place quickly.
The girl next to me grined quite wide, she found it a honor that the exchange schooler should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the Gong sounded, I was frequently stumbled.
Everyone talked and cooked and asked me holes in the stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all their bentos were packed out.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something else than the dead German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, little worsts, salad of grain and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumant.
Most of the time I don't have a pale shock what I'm eating here in Japan.
The things look strange and taste very curious.
Feast says everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plants maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes occurs that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento that then makes her especially artificial in the hope of meeting the boy at the breakdown.
I read of it in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can see this.
'Why does Japan calculate?', my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it's fascinating me."
Finally, I have been reading the most delighted mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started sometime to learn some Japanese.
So it was quite clear for me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a faible for tradition, customs and customs.
And there's great value on it here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep fly in danger mean that she feels fear too?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals too have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they behave similar to us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, without that I or anyone else could prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we may at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply other species and cut on questions of feelings or generally of consciousness, we enter inevitable area because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, escaped or attacked.
People behavior similarly, there are some scientists who conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
First of all, the circuits associated with human consciousness include the side frontal cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and the performance/control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in the rest of the Primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other Primates.
Another dramatic nature is likely to be in the speaking nature of the human being: as a large part of his experience is linked to language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be created, is likely very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, neither can measure nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research faces major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
You could examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one is rather relied on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the arrival of visualisation.
What is the result of the feelings?
I resign to them that a emotional system like that of fear becomes activated in a conscious brain in its own activity.
So what we call " fear" is the mental condition in which we are living when the activity of the brain-located defence system (or their consequences, like physical reactions) proves memory.
This is how feelings are closely bound to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the people.
Related with the linguistic nature, fine graduations of feeling occur, because we can differ and categorize with the help of the words and grammatical conditions in order to attribute them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings of primitive activities in the cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can be involved in cross-border feelings.
Purely theoretical I can't contradict it, but I think it is unseen.
Pankseep argues what appears to be in rats and people like fear, probably also in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly?
Does a shake flee in danger whether she feels fearful?
In my eyes, only behavioral similarity cannot prove equality of experience yet.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, but shaving is not even a brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even shaving (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
Anyway, there is progress at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, even not feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I would prefer to go forward than to run constantly against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for Poland and Ukraine
The vice-president Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"It's not an amnestie for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for building or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
The number of EM countries may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We have to work with the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki according to numerous scandals.
The Commission was meeting at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It exists "the serious risk that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We have insured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several firstligists had been condemned solely during the last season because of manipulation to forced decline, and eventually even the Ligastart had to be postponed short-termly.
Empörer Dennis Quaid rears
She wanted to promote a new movie, said in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outet her flourisher Dennis Quaid as a adult.
He's shoesing and hitting back.
Late Rose War at the Ex-Ehepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now carrying out a disgraceful dispute with each other - in the public.
Meg Ryan had first said in an interview with the US journal InStyle last week to the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful for me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The amount of fraud has not been experienced until after divorce.
The cause for the soul stripease was Ryan's press work for her new movie "The Women" - is told the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outing as an unfaithful husband made clear: "It's unmarried," the 54-year-old of "New York Daily News", said, "I repeat the story of our relationship and devour."
It is also "reasonable", that the common 16-year-old son Jack is once again "remembered publicly the pain and change that means divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since divorce, Quaid is married again and was recently father of Zwillingen.
And so close his instructions with the sides: "My life is going on anyway.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that is best."
Decrease prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights, according to a current study, were even cheaper than 50 percent.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant breakdown in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the nights have already been awarded in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9 per cent in 41 out of 48 surveyed European cities compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before.
As a cause for this, American Express sees the weak dollar price that has led to a "decreasing travellust of American tourists".
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline of hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices are held by 26.3 percent even the record in Europe.
In the case of air fares, the trend in the first quarter also showed upwards:
Due to the cherosinduction, travelers in the economic class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than 2007, fuel intense longitudinal flights even cost up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for tickets in the economic class decreased by an average of 12,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were far lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 per cent.
During German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halfed.
On the one hand, the reason for the inbreak of prices is the dismissing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the flight market brocks.
On the other hand, the open-section agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the stressed situation are the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines who had notified bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe, these were 24 airlines.
HSV hits Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV will be a table leader.
At the Borussia, Luhukay continues to find a working eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein increases break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher first came in the game late and failed with a lifter on the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly on him about the lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger sailed in the cabinet walk of the Hamburg Arena.
Many weren't in the catacombs, the semi-time break was finished and most were sitting back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of the physico therapeut of the HSV, he enjoys a higher sight than some familiar players.
And so his request also found listening to responsible places.
Assistance coach Cornelius Jol nicked and voted in favour of the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg Chieftrainer Martin Jol.
This command will have sounded similarly: Here with gate two!
Implementation remained.
"It wasn't all nice to see today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "sensitive."
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers have to blame the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol collapsed.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers once celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the Arena and the blitz table on the video wall, which showed their association as class primus.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to order this," said Marcell Jansen.
He admits that the table intermediate certificate is more for the incomparability of the League than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Torskytt Petric, and the Jansen of the FC Bayern - is slow to shine yet.
"We need more flairs and more Driblings," Jol asked.
After the reduction of votes
At the Wall Street, the fear is about.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package allowed the Dow Jones to break in 700 points at a time.
This was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow started something again.
By 20:30 a.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer noted by almost five percent in minus at 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology bass was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in minus.
The largest loser was at this time in the Dow American Express, who borrowed almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs gave up by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Great Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the context of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called faul hypothesis are to be provided.
The sum is to be paid, however, not on a hit, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share option certificates of financial corporations which could be invoked in the event of appropriate course development in order to reduce the burden on the State fund.
Share rates in Europe and the United States in Decline
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not address the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and cuts the Dax down.
Despite the planned saving of the financial market, the US index Dow Jones loses the state.
Spectacular rate losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerce Bank have deeply cut the German share index (Dax).
The share of the Munchner real estate financer lost three quarters of its value, despite the rescue operation of federal government and private banks, the Commerce Bank gave more than 20 percent.
The dax shield clearly under the psychologically important 6000 points mark and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide the share markets went into the knee.
In New York, the Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package of the U.S. government could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent at 10.809,25 points during the first trading hour.
The U.S. Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which the Senate vote could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index first followed by 3.2 per cent, CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11.743.61 counters.

The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourist groups also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space zones
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been for ratlessness: Dark matter affects the speed of space suns during the so-called Swing-by-Manöver.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years, the space zone "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Because of shortly freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening the cold tooth.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon of confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight manöver of space zones where they receive additional turn in the gravity field of a heavenly body, like the earth.
This allows the sunshine to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research zone Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sunson Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years: The airlines do not act 100% as it would be expected in accordance with the ancient gravity law.
Instead, there are irregularities at the speed.
The sins become unexpected faster or slower.
Until now, the physics could not explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of matter by crushing the space, may not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton continues to believe that Einstein did not fail and try to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have made.
"Reliant for the anomalie could be dark matter that could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
Obviously, there is an attractive force that affects other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter is always a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists moved into Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostage holders should have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solution negotiations are already in place.
Germans are always going to visit Kidnappern again.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists dropped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media in agreement.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports by the Italian TV transmitter Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostels have been released.
We just check their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well and safely reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The backgrounds of a shooting before the release of the hostels remain unclear: therefore, according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to terminate the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It had been "only because of receiving the hostels," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Tsjad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage holders had demanded a salary of six million euros by Germany; the money should be transferred by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages delayed because the Kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostels after payment of the ransom.
The men should be arrested until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "made to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years after he had found eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro learned that he regularly arrested his step daughter Stephanie Randle as she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs Randle died in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had locked her up and linked her eyes before he carried out sexual actions, while her mother was gone to work in a hospital.
Trerise and his wife read separately in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His step daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the Court learned that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time for the national trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
State lawyer Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends would have said that Mrs Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and bike driver, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had given up your life"
In April 2007, her right father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by braking herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of consciousness, which ended so: "I took her to fetch and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "It must have been fearful for her victims, especially as she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Still worse, the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would end before court if it had not done so."
He added: "I notice the effects, according to the description of Stephanie’s father and mother, of her actions on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data shall be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, is charged under the "public security law".
The man was elected by the Defence Ministry when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transmitted to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no point of criminal intention.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said that the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be interrupted internally at the Defense Ministry and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal lawyer recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he moved included classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B Costs in the eye
British housing companies could be in the house after the salvation of the Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General for the Association of Living Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it is "inexperienceable" that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will eventually be refunded when Bradford & Bingley's loans are deposited.
But the interests purchased in the meantime will be calculated each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed that the BBC included 59 housing companies in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully... are now called on to overtake some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that in relation to the deposits it would have to be paid, each company would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interests for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
That means that companies have to purchase 81 million pounds for the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General for the Association of Living Societys, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have behaved carefully during the real estate recovery are now called on to carry some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see the alternatives to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interests that will be due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 interests will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both-sided organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on spare accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are faced with the need to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the gross market price of his milk by another five pence per litre of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after the investigations of a consultative company have been carried out.
The retailers should decide themselves whether they want to forward the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the gross market price of Jersey milk changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is rejected deposit
A court in Bangladesh rejected a depositary trial by the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defendant said that the Court refused to have pressed 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheich Hasina's long-year political rivale, Khaleda Zia, was released against security at the beginning of this month.
Sheich Hasina was supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Bündnis, called for the military-based transitional government to give her unlimited freedom first.
The correspondents say that, although their postponement has been granted to go to abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will be able to stay free of charge when returning to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers indicate that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheich Hasina's depositary bite because it says that she has not to be granted a deposit, since she is already in prison in abroad to be treated in abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We'll register a judicial inquiry against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need security to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, said a Awami-Bündnis-Partei-President on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but in June she had been released from prison to go to abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheich Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, reject all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent antipolio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccine programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a speaker of the UN, this was the case, despite the promise of the Taliban, that the thousands of people who were carrying out the vaccines should not be attacked or disturbed.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and enabled him to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully obstructing NTL, now renowned to Virgin Media, at the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share in ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of the ITV, which moved the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communication Association, have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV would be an unreasonable and overdriven measure, especially because BskyB had announced to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State lawyer
The U.S. General Prosecutor has ordered a special agent to address the cancellation of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The reason was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the lawyers and the former general lawyer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was encouraged by the fears that the lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
The special agent Nora Dannehy is now supposed to explain whether the officials in question have lying to the investigators in order to prevent justice.
Severe prosecutions, including criminal practices, have not been fully examined or explained, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special agent with the power to force the Witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 released nine US lawyers from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the state lawyers would be released due to weak employment.
However, it was later found that the released lawyers had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level republikan congress members, while others had refused to examine the prosecutions of electoral fraud of Democrats.
U.S. State lawyers are obliged to investigate and persecute court cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
The executive of the Ministry of Justice of the General State, Alberto Gonzales, has been advised for the dismissals under arbitration and has finally settled his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also cancelled.
The General Inspector's report has in particular addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing itself "exceptionally disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chairman of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epical song should be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music price award "Q Award" for his epical Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, the next week in London will accept his special golden price during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track to Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads to the nominations for the award of the price this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief actor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared as single in United Kingdom in 1979 in sale and reached 15 in the Charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heart attack after he had collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute boiler cap inflammation.
Later he became aware that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and maybe selling soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, only, side streets and other round roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street towards the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather for a dust street than after an active road.
There are no road signs, too.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This street still has her admires.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants to replease Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
One of the other contributors is the long-year neighborhood, which says she is fascinated by the short street, just because she is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the city administration department, responsible for the protection and construction of the buildings of living, and responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on the Land Use of the municipality Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road through the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district officer in the municipality Council 3.
"Only very little room has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offering how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road was newly patched and seats, which were intended for a café that the company wanted to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this deceased street and make a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Department of Conservation, said that it had actually been the desire of the city to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared to his bunte neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained something from his historic impression.
Some believe that the street was given its name in 1802 when a large farm, which Philip Minthorne heard, was divided between its many children and a closer strip of land was not claimed by any one.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punkrockdenk gang, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is definitely most known as the scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scratch, lumps and parts of vessels, posters, leaves and seals.
Some inhabitants, including the blogger who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have refused the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left quiet.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog named "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled with "The Book of the Complaints: A bitter nostalgical view of the extinct city"), published a part of the discussion of the city history of Extra Place, published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote then: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse, which remains even dark on day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rain runs along flying weekly newspapers."
With few exceptions, the road looked just like recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the rear part of the street, not far from the door that formerly led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty bottle of beer was not far from a fresh bundle of arranged newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be somewhat polluted.
Fields, added that, according to his opinion, some people underestimate the race of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and ignorant.
Discussion on two-language training: education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific employees in Kaliphonic Studies and Director of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Reaching hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign notes that "the probability of afro-American and hispanic students is a successful completion of the school is lower than white students" - what is true.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama's education plan recommends, among other things, a two-language transitional phase in training for those who learn English first.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether its use for the two-language training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts its interest in reducing the distance in school services.
As an example, we take "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in the eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have been in the country recently, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the students of the fourth class had the state review in Mathe at a good level.
It is also surprising that 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were well assessed in the English test.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in a English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point Obama should observe, according to the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach is worthwhile of the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialized education.
Mrs Mikels, who rejects the idea of two-speaking training, told me that the school had had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later it would be possible to enter the classroom and no longer recognise it.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The services of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the education policy positions within its own party (the national image unification associations have long supported the idea of two-speaking training) and its own consistent support for the two-speaking training make predictions of Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop making concerns about the "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You're supposed to make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance distance, he should take care of education models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of renewed anxiety about the economy
On Monday, the oil price is strongly deprived of the fear that even the American rescue plan for financial markets could not be sufficient to resurrect the economy.
The sales of raw oil at the New York Trade Basket fell by 7 per cent to $99.80 per Barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
During the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulencies on the Wall Street and by strong turbulent storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.9 per Barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per Barrel this month to then, again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have proved themselves worried again, although congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan in the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup will purchase the banking transactions of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European Financial Group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the stressed negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not succeeded in living the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation is further worsening, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts of the German Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US American virus is spread worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 decreased by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Inside defense Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he experienced more often in the last eight and a half years than any other in the Jets Tricot.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen something like that," said Ellis.
After a smart game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, this highlighted the perfect entrance to a afternoon when its development collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which one time went out as an outstanding defense and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the semi-time.
"I haven't made a special effort," says Coles about the passport that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were capturing, the defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took away.
Foreign defendant Darrelle Revis started a unsuccessful throw and turned it into a 32-year-old touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and started him.
Linebacker David Bowens then led to a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets resumed the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 Yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points that the Jets ever had achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini answered the coach of Jets, "The second quarter or third quarter?"
On both the answers, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without getting one one, Mangini said: "I believe I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Equipped Bresselsassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think it is the best long-term runner of all times after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who has achieved the distance of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved his previous result from 2:04:26 at 27 seconds that he had reached last year in Berlin.
Brerselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th World Record in his multi-page career, in which he at least reached a world championship title or sets a world record on every distance from one kilometre to the Marathon.
Last month, Brrselassie has released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear that may have been exaggerated in the afternoon that air pollution could make its asthma problems worse.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In nearly ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Bresselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen for more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Bresselassie told the press that he had had two weeks ago had struggles in his wade and couldn't train a week.
Obviously, he has been refreshed after break and has not come back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"It's all done perfectly.
I took up the training again a week ago and had still some concerns today, but at the end everything super."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively organizing his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the runners as if it were a railway race, and making world records about the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Brselassess as long-range runners.
Following four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite-ups from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Brrselassie after the pacemakers had left.
Some more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last entry to separate himself from Kwambai, which arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time for nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48.
In women Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing at 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon in 2:24:14 surprisingly.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her course by getting a quartet out of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became the second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the straps in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special nature
Hidden between the excursions of the recreational parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first whole black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three rocket places, 300 brown houses, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrim place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
Still, it is and remains the city it describes – and it made a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel leader, who was produced at the time of depression by the Federal writer project – in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, served and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's going away from him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open talk about race relationships, many are still sorry to be observed from outsiders.
"We are very interested in how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a inhabitant of the city and municipality member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of the triumph and the battle.
It is a historic example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a highburg of literature and on the other, an example of the black culture of the southern rural culture that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that inhabitants here are both proud and hated.
And so correctly, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all of us called Hurston.
She presented the world her home city in books that came from heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Leader changed the city, very close to route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech like Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonville's first Mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to private matters.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown -wisely stretched modern school, with her cared gardens and playgrounds, which always cares for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witness Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-auch-immers fit for hours rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that has been appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls forever the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, full of sexual plays.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively excentrician who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston broke into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a delicate chevrolet, smoking and dressing with pants, in a city that today represents something on her honorable style of clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, while many of them despised.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But " she never stayed too long," he added as he shocked in his chair, on a rear terrace that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized for all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were written.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she once was a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was added to an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great Memorial, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-speed motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-speed main road of the municipality.
Orlandos Vororte had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, including, had ended the relative idyllical isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing of hatred brought into the Community.
"In this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the off-site people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelone out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston asked the Supreme Court to force integration by calling his decision against the school Council as "political rather than my race".
Inhabitants today say that although the racing of racial centres was positive in some respects, they weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Black children were used to get armed - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and were embraced his teacher in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural climb," said Mrs Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who rejected prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the nameless grave of Hurston and began to fight for the reconciliation of her praise.
Five years later, a very praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the books and made it part of the American literature canon again.
The remote road project came just at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
In 1988, the municipality began planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district reversed from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-speed road lived the city, accelerated the whole with peak speed, raised real citizen chair," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There came more and more tourists, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the historical register in 1998.
A new unique library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly pleasant and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos may sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as then when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outstanding looking for the history of Eatonvilles and its significance are still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, which was painted by a whiteman and represented black men in field work - may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a favorite for dark red, still fear that her abscured community will misunderstand.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival became larger, a higher degree of home chair was also born.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, not bader or better and as proud, creative and zealous, male and mixed as any other race and nation group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city management or in the police that could use some help.
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of people who are only going through here will think, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York, we're talking flowing financial latine.
At first, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were distanced from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens at the Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they were in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the scary-large offices with the glasses, bankiers and Hedge Fund managers, who have the monopoly in New York, they have daily the worst horror working day since the 1929 exchange crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea walls along the citizen and transport tablets charged with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallows between apartments around how human pack animals load around the 50 belted T-shirts, which hang on a yoke-like stack on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the citizen-climbing foods on their breakfast ball and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis until Thursday afternoon, because of all the world's fall, I decided to open a new saving account.
Although I had decided to place my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branches, some 20 people were already snakes.
Not to pay or pay money to the credits, but at the customer service switch where stamkunds order checkbooks, ask tourists for the road to the purchase house Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employees with license", was the same reason as I was serpent.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they pendated, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and States Island.
They had reimbursed money from so-called Taffets (a little similar to a building sparekasse), cooperative banks and local spare banks, which only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bank management over and as the last Friday of New Yorker during the weekend, was looking for a rescuing buyer, Wachovia, another bank that has spare facilities in value of $440 billion.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop employees brought their bares to a bank that is considered safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
In recent weeks, the New Yorker's entirely normal financial latine has been in place.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese family supermarket took so much confidence in Lehman Brothers, the Pleite Bank, and their deceived Chairman Dick Full, as if she would read about a faulty colleague.
And Lyn, who has come from our usual entertainment rooms on Brad and Angelina and my food delivery around my 50-year-old concierge of my living block.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to go in a risko anymore."
Muslim graves damaged during legal routine in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-righter of the Austrian Rights Party of Austria, and Philipp Dewinter, member of the Belgian Rights Pertei Vlaams concern, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "Stadts against Islamization".
They carry pictures in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is represented, stretched through with a red line.
The police accused legal extremists of grave scanning at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right parties, of considerable gains in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the evening of Friday tomorrow, more than 90 graves on the cemetery in Traun at Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The actors sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officers believe that this is an attempt to diminish the motive of the extremists driven by the hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said that she was "deeply shaken" about the message of grave scanning, which took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria, after the country has gone to the right in the last parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, the two far-right parties received almost 30% of the votes, put themselves in their electoral struggle for a strict anti-migrant law, and some of their votes were criticized by opposers as foreign enemies.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, claimed a ban on headtuchs and Burkas and even announced his rejection against food that is generally related to Islam.
At his last advertising in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minorates with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Assessment and analyses that have been carried out directly after the election and which say that the extreme rights of the most political blocks in the country are, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Abroad Travel Locker for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been condemned to the sexual abuse of children, was legally prohibited to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter set up a six-month lock after he informed the control authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent was given to the last Thursday to hang a foreign journey locker after presenting evidence to the judges of the pre punishment of Glitter due to sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Court of Office in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyer.
"On Thursday, 25 September, the police requested Kent at Ashford's Court of Justice the authorisation to prevent foreign travel from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register of sexual penalties, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his planned departure.
The failure of the notification of the authorities could lead to a penalty of 5 years.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"Our view is that it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the highest concern of the police in Kent to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex criminals in the country in order to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was planning to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport control and he fled to Hong Kong after some.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter, and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials relied on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at the terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Court of Justice of Uxbridge in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for the authorisation to require him to register himself as sex punishers.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 because of the possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Inner Minister Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was held to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruins, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flamencot dancers, who dismiss the concentration and devote the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, at these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen view or expression strength of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to be in the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer represents theatralik of some scenarios on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was not known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamen coding at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco's month's photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which becomes increasing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to move the audience on the stage of passion, sadness, joy.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What was interested in me to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamen comeists with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images created that remember classical photography.
The use of various styleistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and idea as the Bauer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that are changing and surprised every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who conceives the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that will be visible in the form of hearing, of His, and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of nearly seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer passion to the portrait led him to take this idea again two years ago and to realise it as the portraits of the Veterans of Sports (‘SportART Project’).
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer is pleased to `I am very pleased to photograph the people, to meet them and to put me in their life condition, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or stand on people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you for a couple of minutes alone to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realise my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos from today with the title `Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallerie of the El Fotomata, which is located in the street name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the road la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is 'an incredibleness'.
He does not know where the Roman's action takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project at which he is working, a novel with the Protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived 20 years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prizemaker admitted that the project with which he was employed is 'a great courage' and' everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
"If I had been conscious, I wouldn't have done it, but I'm going to do it and hope to end the novel at any time," so he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Premium of the Festival Hay Festival and gave its voice to most attended, is compared with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan, who has a wonderful memory and great humor feeling, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: as his call for literature, which was made out of 'exceptional adventure lust', of 'rejoining reading' and 'more want to experience than before'; as he writes and observes `Disziplin', to supplement the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and reviews that he makes; like Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas, his call and what `Gedächtnis images' it is that are the foundations for his stories.
The hispano-American Roman writer acknowledged that there is no way to measure and where to know whether books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a refuge experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is 'effects' and 'the people even more apart', therefore I asked the writers not to leave the lightness' and 'overtake responsibility' for his call'.
During the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: the bull feast fell partly.
After the announced bull fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bull feast with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed was moved yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the bull feast.
Thus, the festival of the inconstant weather was exposed, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it raind, why the second planned bull feast could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the pierfightfarena.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut down three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had managed more by galoppering than by his bull fighting art.
And even worse was El July, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without praise.
After he had fought so badly, a large majority of the audience responded in his second battle with bow calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilos of hash.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon, Álava.
Two policemen urged the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the escape.
It looked like they shouldn't stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as it announced the Inner Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forfeiting official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Transport Police of the region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of a few kilometres. At the moment the drivers went out of the car to flee over a road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug dealers transported 2,78 kg of Haschisch, which was captured by the police.
The front part of the car was charged with hasch bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the balance of the band to other police services.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'doublet', so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the Kfz papers, and therefore an additional arrest was made because of the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to take the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the infected drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was brought to an admission to a police office. It is presented to the judge in the next hours.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested in Santa Barbara (Californien) this weekend because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness observed how she tried to run out of her parking holes in Montecito in a pretty strange manner, spokesmen of the California Transport Police Reported to the Magazine 'People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear `after 16:30 Clock gaspedal pressed and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking lot, and when she went back, she took her sunglasses a few times.'
Something later, the Witness, who at first probably hadn't recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who informed the emergency service because she had lived `angry about Locklear'.
When the police strips came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the road and thereby blocked the traffic.
`They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to one police speaker, the actress showed itself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials result, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was suspected to drive under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation at 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the clinic in Arizona, where it was treated against fear and depression.
Llamazares is in order to ensure that the Andalusian Association of the United Lefts will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has now assured that the regional association for education will be the ones who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Council House in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which had been withdrawn last week after being accused of making business with family members.
"In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out what the party must have to do with those who are currently sitting as a city council in the Sevilla Municipal Council.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for the 'Transparency' in the possible investigations of the infringements of the rules that Silva could have started: 'The VL always claimed that such cases would receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a stringent ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euro investment for the turning work.
In this way, the Cineast tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he always admired to the works of the famous Roman writer, today, Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long catalogue of the publishers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in Kinos and later on the broadcaster Telemadrid is shown as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this turning work, his 'Kindheitstraum' was fulfilled. This he owed Esperanza Aguirre, who ordered him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to turn a Memorial to the second century celebration in Madrid. Above all because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for turning work, Garci, as he added, offers the "one-time possibility" by means of decorations and related clothing the picture of "conflicted Spain, which elected the false leader for the fight, because the people had been remembrated by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII."
However, the Cineast regrets that the funding could not be calculated as with the 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the turning book could not be rotated with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', took part in his ordinary work: he set himself on the stages of the actors with which one must first test before starting to rotate and for those who had not casting, he appeared `demütiging' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors on which he stands in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci expects no awards for this movie.
At the beginning you think you are working for the descendants, later you notice that it is only for pleasing, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of occupational activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencotender from Sevilla honours a dancer who also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family was moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on Eastern dances.
She had a exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistin, a vegetarian, and set herself for the removal of the corsett, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces at the dance and esthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We don't try to tell her about her life without keeping her esprit," said the flamencotender.
Your dance bases helped me in Flamenco a lot.
For example, the dance of the butterfly appeared to me like Guajira, or the dance of the serpent like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I have been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The scenario is computed with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco Chairman Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-trainers.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The scenario also calculates with musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the actress Juanfra Juarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in which he always loved.'
This work also tells you in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in so far-sized places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although normally she lived in London.
`I wanted to remind her, because I think it is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain season and their works no more today and therefore they know less of it', says Bayón.
The idea takes place today at 20:30 in the Theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, Zenobia offers an appropriate atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Trienium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is the reminder of the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the literature nobel price and the death day of both.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia's housemuseum and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and presented during the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can feel bad without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him in `Sensation reporter', and from the then dominant idea of the US-American cinema, which was left behind, came from all America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what she cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he moved back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, this was a great struggle for everyone.
`What sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the biggest drowses of his life.'
No one was afraid not to be ridiculous or overwhelming.
As `father' of the cinema and the father's country, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the depressed self-value of the Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people who can be admired, you must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he had a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as a number of losses as well as gains: from the foundation that has prescribed the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage that died of overdose, was founded up to its own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to carry out against a fatal nutrition culture.
A wide wave of enthusiasm hits haushoch to take over Hollywood without respect for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize carrier, said that the work with Newman was no more or not less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to mention Newman as his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the largest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trusting to live today as Paul Newman lived: receive high demands for justice, lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always simple or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who trys, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He was divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years afterward, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities to not be.
"Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?" he often screwed myself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
"From all the great roles he played, on no one he was as proud as to those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentionful Opa and those of the Philanthrope," they say.
For the Olympic Games, the roads in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was referred to as a perfect road, and my assessment after, she was the worst road with everything on it.
Of course, this is a lot of foolishness if you were to observe the assessment and I could check it, it would clearly not be done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The fool starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to go first.
It also seems to me not bad, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including Chip to avoid the vacation on the road).
So don't.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first ignorance that is to go there only) and (after an infinite waiting queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second ignorance because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it so that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
So good, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you must leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is impossible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we hadn't let our back bags lie before it, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to get back.
In addition, it looked like, in this 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a people rebellion and to overcome the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time in the classification because of this chip, which I have received, I can already think that the exit was stamped wrongly.
Of course, if you were to ask me for a perfect road, this road would never attack me.
So I think we'll dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this `Receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also be arranged for the attendees after the discussions.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group leading with her conversation and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That's certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they spoke very superficially about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and do not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, this will be only for the smaller.
Everything is only one finding if you remember that Microsoft added some function in Windows versions and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worth
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually in significance, just as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Sentantly, many pointed out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to informing his mother’s mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think of his 'dood', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, for this more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and we spend more time every day on browsing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
For what does half of existing applications serve in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easy, not overdriven, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more in integrating its online services, which can then finally become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt, and I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the restraint rooms for Microsoft Employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresh drinking machine is a sign attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of the employees used Microsoft, Google for research on the network.
On the other hand, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of bringing Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well built priest.
When we start counting the countless stars appearances, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, with a spice bart that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circuit.
In fact, it is a typical male T-shirt of cotton, unarmed and tailored.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called in the close circle `Marcel'. The legend tells us that the name design is connected to sport and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surrounds all because of his excellent cotton, because of its different Unisex cuts and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (cautible) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck section.
And respect, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Caschmire, Hosen of Cotton, T-shirts with strips, Babys, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
You're very angry.
"I want to be a young mother; for the candidate I don't worry."
Her great appearance with her sister, she did not prevent her own personality from developing.
Monica Cruz is terrible, but full of life's joy.
At present, the sisters Gruz take their new activities very seriously in the fashion.
For Monica this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, leaving her seat and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shocking, winner on the short lines.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner of Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time that is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I'm fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and the 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and observe women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I believe it, but finally, everything is in one and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around in the garments of my aunt and see her clothes.
It was great to go almost better than to a recreational park.
Once later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel good.
As a actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real shower role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and its professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, haven't you gone into a crisis?
Oh, something.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was young, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think you're gonna be a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I've been aware that I'm going to be a mother because this requires my body and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let that escape.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about it.
I'm going to give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with much love.
As regards the film art, you keep in mind the works you have participated in and the last year was turned.
That is exactly the way, and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, is very distressed and unhappy and wants everything at once that of course cannot be immediately.
I wish that `La ultima hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not that I went to the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have been familiar with for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the welfare event of her organization `France for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothing pieces of our collection for Mango were raised to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I'm the one she knows would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handle, I will do so.
To support the women in the third world, whatever is necessary.
The drivers, which can be retired because of the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official punishments due to the alcohol level, installs in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car will not be running.
The initiative has been announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the State Prosecutor General, which is a pilot project which will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, and therefore he will receive a course for the retraining of the traffic behaviour.
Apart from the lawyer-general, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute of Safety of Automobiles will also participate in it.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers, who had been shown more than once because of the driving under alcohol influence, were resumed to tax.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents autostart if the driver has made alcohol tests; or if a alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs will be borne by the one who penalizes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have prevented up to 65% of the infringements of rules in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is expected that 115 human lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to adopt this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legislative reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal persecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and public transport vehicles.
In the morning, the parliamentary House will vote for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British pointline, at 17:40 p.m., at the time planed by the program, next to the presidential hanger of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the Spanish Air Force, traveled with the Prince and Prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that went out of the plane.
Direct at Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours before I had asked a taxi driver on the street, if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there you can't take people at the airport at this time.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived a couple of years here.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 marine soldiers who give honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair weighed by the wind, without usual 'peep-toes', maybe she was told that it was expected to be a twitter in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official success is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are brought, one of the four biggest in the city, waiting for her a reporter from the Mexican TV that likes to make a joke.
The best premium of the fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of the fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase in young fashion talents.
This is awarded at the money price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the show window of the Mango branches on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris last night and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
Furthermore, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are related to the fashion designer Valentino wants to thank for his jurisdiction in competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, broken together. He dressed the dress from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH that was breathtaking. He kept on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino to his honor at dinner.
Andik, the owner of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended with the baron of Rockschild without Jacketts, because Jacketts lent them to the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has rushed to business and had a pocket and a shirt that she modelled herself, and to dinner she had a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballett samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a stab and made a kind of `grand pllie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the Palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always excites a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) at the International Hotel in Paris, asked to have a room without smells.
The stars under the glorious sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is not 1000, but one way more to forget chaotics for us fast everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book in which it is how to relax. The book comes into the book stories on 30 September.
The weather is a punishment when he calls at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems that you take away from the world of work.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga statements, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the full list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress means `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus the rest that the book transmittes, comes into the book deals by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplace by means of personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins is no longer rising to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, switch the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talk in the Sleep
Some children speak in the night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us what happened on the day before, but the children who speak during the sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disturbance called the speech in the sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you have been told that you spoke in the night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (a time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regular (every day, once a week, once a month), the child can remember nothing on the next day.
There is no only reason to cause this appearance.
Often, links are searched with other appearances in the sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed nose in the night), talk in the sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress situations or excess.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite a opposite (scream, weeping, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and be advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem which causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, with the sleep-apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to stimulate the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children whose relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep calmly.
When the speech occurs once in the sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is unnecessary, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of the sleep.
Though the child speaks, it's sleeping, so it's resting.
Remember, when a couple of appearances show anxiety, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so usual), the child is not under pressure to carry out an inquiry and get more information.
So you will not be able to accomplish this, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that, therefore, they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... eventually
After a long thirst line, illhouses on the field are finally back on a success course.
Without a great effort, the yellow blacks played many torchances and made it possible to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this meeting, at which the attackers were trying to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the host captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot nearly at the angle pre-bedding, Illhouses should dominate the game with lightness, and it did alternately first fonderflick with a remote shot, then the brain with a highpass, and Romania with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposition team blocked in the field center and only passed through the vibrant riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half time should be decisive with two first fighted by Riahi and temporal Torchances, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhouses through Marais, who was exactly right to accept a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
However, the ill-huusian Torskytt should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and about twelve minutes later being sent to the bank, so that his teammates had to continue to play countlessly.
Denmark, however, did not use this, and did not face any major problems of an illhaeusic eleven, which only moved back a little to defend their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball was very close to the late.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flys to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stagger into the Bretagne.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several breton and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, founded by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which reached an average of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the seafarers.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with decisiveness.
On Tuesday morning, they led in Morbihan and Calvado's protest march, which caused nearly ten kilometres of length.
Quiberon's seaport was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break down.
The Peninsula Quiberon was bound up with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations from the early morning on tyres and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Arctic Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fisheries did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manöver of trade ships.
The fishermen of turballs and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved in the evening the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give up in any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, announced.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel costs about 50 cents at present, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the wonderful
The unforgettable publisher from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 on the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, agreed to the quinoleing and engaged actress Paul Newman, who died at 83 years of age.
Embraer holds his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculates this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a risk for the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest manufacturer of the world, holds its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft supplied, confirmed his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the size order of 30 to 120 seats.
Until now, Embraer 41 machines have delivered to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers to reimburse more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the 85 billion dollars allocated to it.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their life insurance at international level and their age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Administrative Board of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
One of the assets that AIG might distinguish from, its aircraft leasing-filiale International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the back-safe Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and its investment in the private equity, continues the FT.
With regard to this sale, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG has to take the sales to return the loans of more than 85 billion that you have granted the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Meeting of Historical Morning Meeting
On Monday, after the representative chamber rejected the plan Paulson to save the banks, the New York Exchange reported a historic case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never ever loss of nearly 800 points, and the afternoon 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final discount figures, the Index afternoon, mainly related to technology, has fallen by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widespread Index Standard&Poors 500 is 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan for saving the banks by the Chamber of Members, which should enable some stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
By 228 votes against, and 205 for that, the members refused the funds he had asked to the financial secretary Henry Paulson.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"Here is a bad image that makes the congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'to be too late'.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (American Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would more restrict the credit conditions', Brian Bethune warned at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, as she stressed the feeling of extreme urgency, that every day, which goes, brings the ruin of a financial company in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's bankruptcy through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures to the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets were not only looking forward to an American, but to a global crisis, added the FTN Financial Analytics.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The government fund's revenues in ten years have decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827%, and the revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV show
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television dual, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families.
The political analytic David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, even though it was very prominent, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which was published on Saturday on a question of opinion, according to Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that democracy clearly makes the better figure.
In the still undecisive voters, that is, those to which it is now, Obama came out with 39% as winners from the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them McCain saw as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his front on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his Rivalin Sarah Palin
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has a good instinct, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his inconsistent experience in the field of foreign policy in the foreground of the 'naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duty.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he emphasized several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election advertising spots last yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without having to get out of the version.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the picture that the world has from the United States.
"McCain, however, has not yet understood, Obama," this weekend put a democratic advertising spot against which the Republican was proposed not to have covered the complete extent of the crisis that has been loaded on the 'American from the road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama pranged up 20 000 people last night, who had gathered in streaming rain at a election event in North Carolina.
He didn't even mention the words "Medium" or "Workers". The financial crisis creates a clear advantage to Obama, who thinks the Americans are the best to save the economy even at the edge of the defeat.
`The next week could be a decisive turning point', the impressive democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compared the 'good economic instinct' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After remarking that he would even be able to reduce the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, was a priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates considerably describe the questions that have been raised on the plan for saving the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress yesterday evening and are extremely unloved by the people.
"Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?"
Youths and oppositional showed Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of Parliament elections in advance.
Some hundred white robes gathered Sunday evening since closing the election room on the market of Minsk to protest against the deceitful nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should be resigned'.
Some admit that they haven't chosen at all: 'What is useful if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has been best shown to the foreign observers in order to resume the negotiations with the European Union, is willing to perform a democratic turn.
The penalties, including the non-release of visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the requiring of certain assets, could be cancelled if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded by the electoral committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the statement', regreted Juri Potemkin, press speakers of the Union's democratic forces, a heterogenous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who tells the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, then because they were appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean time of broadcasting on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of mixing into the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly guilty of Russia, is in a crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of being a Russian Protectorate.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which has followed the election process, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It emphasizes that the numbers of votes appear too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has given the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, the leader of the Social Democrats, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
No one was in the election rooms.
And there will be no more than five opposition members in Parliament, who are those who are most in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night drops over the October place again.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Choice Commission congratulates on their success.
Disagreement - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has recovered the public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood pendant service of the Canadian red cross during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Canadian Government in February 1994 launched a public investigation conducted by the judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and drawing up directives in order to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitating to submit his report, several provinces then set a committee on the legs whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up their work, almost 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraged.
Through the huge efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and work in this area during the following years, we have recovered public confidence," she says, before pridely emphasizes that in early 2008, almost 94% of the population in Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in the consciousness that "trust is something very cruel".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts in accordance with the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the appearance of many cases of the human form of bovine misery in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman who has the lead since the foundation of 1998.
"And we didn't have the least idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we call on one of the main directives of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which are accordingly applied to exclusive measures if you do not know this, and when a disease progresss only slowly, as it is obviously the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which is indispensable to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was accepted by persons who had stopped longer than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it has been proven that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technique appeared on the market for the detection of HIV: Nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which enable it to prove the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as it was in the tests used so far.
The NSTs made it possible to shorten the incubation time, between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and they could not recognize this, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, it means that you would need to distribute 12 million blood conserves before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema Quebec distributes between 400.000 and 500.000 blood conserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood conservation.
I believe that today you can feel well if you get or write a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what disease agonists can get into the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus has appeared on the island of Réunion, which, as the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor without delay," continues Dr. Décary before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
`The need is increasing because the population is growing.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donation network, among which only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants are suitable for blood. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the suitability criteria can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who supply their blood are not accepted because they are ill, for example, AIDS or malaria, and who are traveling to a country where malaria is spread, is excluded from blood donors for one year.
`With these 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can no longer spend blood.
It is difficult to convince people to spend blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour during blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, cardiovasculars, eye apples and skin, which are used almost exclusively in the case of severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel blood bank of Quebec.
In the navel sniff, which was previously considered biomedical waste, tribal cells are rich blood that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth navel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should begin to make it available for transplantation in the beginning of next year', explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of navel blood loss as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finale
Montreal's Impact went on yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-winning (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decide the game of the quarter-final series in the Saputo Stadion, where the total gate ratio counted, for the semi-final round of the excretion games of the first League of the USL.
The middle-field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetiest game minutes.
After a first half time without gates both for the one and for the other side, the Mediterranean players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other meetings for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember, at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a pre-location of Seattles had introduced a 2-to-1 position.
In the semi-final Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps went into the half-final round with a total tower ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to meet the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly said - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of all shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel.'
`He fixed himself too much in the first half of the time, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause.'
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the introduction of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Link) is trying to be elected in the present partial election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term objective that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, who followed all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular pictures of water power plants, mountains, viewed by Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the electoral period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he will stop the elections of this autumn, even if he was confused that his calendar was very full.
The `Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a vision that the Prime Minister claims for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides an agreement with France on employees, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent years, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th width - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister restricted himself to explain why the north 'a jewel with huge potential', but no date, no amount of investment or precise priorities for the future projects.
At least a few views on what could be done more: particularly water energy, forests, but especially mining sectors, are favoured by the growth of the thresholds and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest, the Nordic Neckle, Zink, Copper, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan, and even Diamonds.
This `biet twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us, he stressed how to clearly show that he is seeking to realise a national foundation room.
Quebec grew very much by his connection to the north, he stressed: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James book.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put a theatral break to consider the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec region, includes a part of Labrador with which Quebec has always claimed, explained to the press Prime Minister.
`This is a traditional attitude that pursued all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity I will take this attitude again on behalf of the government," he explained.
In addition, 'with the climate change we have to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the northwest passport, which will be ridiculable throughout the year due to the ice cream.
In front of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal very carefully with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (heavy pecist members of Ungava) have already initiated discussions in about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Ground Establishments) takes an important place, the work has taken place.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create a common vision.
On the other hand, the development of the north will take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
He promised that the plan of North will be discussed, regulated and environmentally environmentally.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if it was a continuation of the liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
`As the liberals who were in office before us, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new growth and development tanches.
This was, on Friday, one of the subjects of the weekend that was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the partial leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Stauddamm.
"From Godbout, who created hydro-Quebec, about reading that reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, always knew our party to determine the future," explained Jean Charest.
He referred to a different, this time conservative project, to the programme `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Waterkraftampe Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stresses that its entry into service was intended for 2012.
"It remains among us, but I'm going to be there," he trusted his party members, which resulted in those storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact the possibility of holding this autumn of a choice that is possible from the law yet not excluded.
He stresses that his calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The weekend General Assembly created a platform of nationalist plans to the Liberal Party Chairman, in particular from 'the Constitutional Objectives' which have been adopted: The PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the 'Speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the Nord Plan's guidelines were taken with Skepsis.
The Chief of the Party Québécois, Pauline Marois, has repeated the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry Government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, failed to apply them.
If she had done it, we'd have been much further today', Mrs Marois judged at the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has spoken for supporting the adoption of a plan in north by the government.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea', the party leader Sébastien Proulx explained in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the vacation today.
Letters - A disturbed country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz Minister (which irony) in the Cabinet Harper was the one who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that they were a 'shadow' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unwilling fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover so with shock, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker itself.
We have to do with a government here that has not, as the only of all the countries concerned, brought their countryman captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp home.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a young man when things happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks their words and lets a child soldier go to it under inhuman conditions.
The only one who leaves to a court parodie to estimate the debt of the accused person.
Let us remember that, especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers, they plan to get Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair process in Canada.
Just this government also closes the eyes before torture: It is little interesting for her that after so many years of difficulty, a young adult will certainly be broken forever.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are currently experiencing a tricky cutting of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper is constantly carrying as a flag before itself, and that sounds so nonsense from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be randomly abused, tortured and locked up, depending on a government chief who is only supported by the minority until today (may belong to minority after 14 October).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has dismissed the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellish Tale of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwellic logic that the world's largest gold gain society was pursuing a disappointment of more than six million against three authors and a small medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'publicly transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of deceit, but of the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely disappeared by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to lead a public debate to drive everyone into ruin who dares to represent one of its opposed opinions.
Whatever the process is going on, the authors and the publisher of Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight against a army of lawyers who are paid from the nearly insufficient pockets of the gold mine.
On the other hand, the tactics of these inequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders, to force an agreement that makes the counterpart mouth-dood and also to shock everyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold is working, debates in Canada are usually carried out by the exchange of ideas and not by kneeling.
So it would have been enough if the Goldmine opened up their books and documents and opened a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement at the side.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a public debate at the same time and, however, disregard the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President covers only the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very beautiful vision of the concept.
In a democracy, the right of speaking is self-inferior.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many people consider as a knee complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this concept...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the finding of truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long known to deal with debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what she claims, it does not have a desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The management of Bush and the directors of the Congress, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the great depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking the Wall Street for months has still to be adopted by the two convention chambers.
The main content are: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, new facilities to reduce the number of houses caught due to payment residues and the right to monitor the wages paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Members of Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', explained the representative of the Management Bush, Henry Paulson.
"It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at the Wall Street," explained the Democrat.
"This is the basic point: If we do not, the dream, the chaos and the troubles will be enormous in the Americans' daily life," the Republican Judd Gregg explained.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that the investors had had had a new failure.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market tomorrow.
The two American presidency candidates, who took part lately in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as the supporter of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfiedness about the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama relied on the addition of certain facilities to agree, especially those that would allow owners to keep their houses and those which concern the salary of the governing employees of the companies saved by the State.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the unresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to congratulate you.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another broadcaster if he would vote for the proposed plan, his republikan opponent John McCain answered: "I would like to know the details only, but I hope it.
`The guides I have read show that this is one thing we all have to devour, and with which we will be able to come forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It arrives 14 months after a crisis resulting from the place of a real estate bubble, which first led to the breakdown of risky hypothecillary credits (subprime), before expanding to other forms of spread loans (PCAA), and eventually to freeze into financial power and ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of republikan Members was the one who failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'gifty' assets of the societies in distress are only to be secured and not purchased by the government, they believe to escape the sackgasse.
In order to round the viewpoint for all at the congress, one has also added a provision that says that if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, they can then raise new taxes in order to retrieve its used capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payments must be adopted in a new vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring it to dividends in the event of profits and that can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the settlement procedures relating to the housing bound to the real estate credits covered by this plan and also to lay down deadlines for the repayment and findings paid to the managers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the parliamentary committee to vote on it today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday, there were other votes against this project, both on the sides of the Republicans and on the Democrats.
`It is obvious that Washington does not understand us', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his voters.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in order to ask the taxpayers to the box.
The Democratic Member Brad Sherman, head of a group at the Congress called the Caucus of the Skeptikers, represents things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be under pressure, and carefully consider what way is going to be inclined," he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At a emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial government of the Fortis Banking Group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The entry of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced GDP Paribas that she would not buy her competitor, which is in great difficulties since she lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, explained yesterday the Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive a choice right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now as uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, on the other hand of the arrogance channel, the British Government was just in the position to state another bank put into distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) of real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that she would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was a long time his trompet, no one would say his weakness.
Has the American actress released the charming smile from the narcissian mirror?
Yes and no.
His phenomenon, his sensibility and a obvious talent may have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he similared and for which he was a kind of rivale on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his vision, with surely more crushed, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dreams should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristics.
For in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man, reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific war, who studied play art in Yale at the beginning of the fifty years and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television and soon in the movie.
This man, who struggled for citizens' rights, was also the driver who became the 24-hour race of Mans Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown faces also disappear this mysterious, backholding, engaged and over-sensitive star gloom of show business, whose puzzles will never be perfectly solved.
A pleasant man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death moved the cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his big roles were played.
More than a half-century American film art in constant change moves over with him.
The charming cowboy from the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is again pressed into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is raised to his sensible Mr Bridge, who is disturbed in his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were there in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable Boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of drack) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was re-incorporated after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathic Ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded with the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and razoric Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
Still you.
In his life course, Epoches are united.
The youth knows him primarily from the culture film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as the Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox trainer of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a last role in 2003 as the Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinema people who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the seat for a long time, and bear Hollywood, his asset, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `Underplaying' when he assessed his all-expressive performances.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the rolls were flying in such a way for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as a outsider: neurotics, alcoholists, figs, or desperate, with which perfect representation he shield and reflected his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, signed a fine female portrait full of melanchol.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, devoted his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of fine feelings and sadness.
During the flood of honours that came over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared very much: "He's present has improved my life and this country."
Yield and joy of life were essential properties of the dead actress.
Apart from his legendary career, a great prosecutor of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's disappearance, is now going there.
We have often seen him standing in sauces, bags or other foods, with the foot in shells full of vinaigrette, and this seems to be quite tasted, although we found it fun at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flow into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And it was an honor for us to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actress.
A model citizen, in the closest and in the widest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of grant &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations begin in the criminal process against Jáno's grant and its complications.
In particular, the accused person is proposed to participate in organised crime, as well as serious harmful damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document falsification.
According to the lawyer, the appropriations made by the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly in the Kassen of the Organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities stated, in relation to the payments of tenders, fictional accounts were submitted and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the accusation, most of the invoices should have been faked.
The accounting blocks were bought on the market by Jozsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to be issued to the invoices was decided on that round tour north of the Plateinsee to which Isván Lados was sent by Jáno's grant.
During this "exploration tour" Lados should find out pensions and restaurants.
He demanded invoices on the consumption in order to postpone later on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Labour and the Self-Administrative of Budapest.
These accounts should have been manipulated by the majority of Isván Lados and its complicated, András
One of the goals of Lados' exploration tour was a beer room.
As are two accounts issued in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have accomplished the ninety-headed group of the Association of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the boss of the company indicates that such a large group would not have entered into the local place at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 on the Foundation of Job Jöv ért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also revealed grave form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which only has three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, it is supposed to have stopped 130 guests in charge.
The fantasy of the counterfeiters was apparently no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents of the customers Job Jöv
As manager Gy
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly applied on the stamp."
And further: Besides form faults, the fact was also wrong that the operation should have housed a hundred people after they have a total of 11 rooms that are impossible for so many people.
Also, the restaurant has been no longer operated on the invoice.
The emsige accounting counterparts have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel office taken to the Visier is exclusively offering travels to abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary raids on the cash-payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has been known during the investigations, they have also shown the VAT tax on the invoices, although travel offices related to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect at four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation of Job Jöv ért, as the operation accounted for only 15 per cent VAT instead of 25, and the employees are only issued machine invoices, but the false documents were handwritten.
A further error undergoing the accounting officers was the fact that they had indicated in a case of "waren transport" as a result of performance, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the State lawyer informed.
Further form errors - incorrect account format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, as well as XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be declared as falses.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers were dear to have never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is the falses at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was just in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the Mass Manager therefore stated that the invoices had not been issued.
Conscious fake
The other groups of accounting officers are people who were well aware that they would have to lay fictional accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapitvány issued accounts for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an amount of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the accusation, the manager of the Collab Kft was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The biogate Kft, which is currently located in Liquidation, should also have cooperated with supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH should have provided the Foundation Job Jöv
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers comprises persons who are directly related to the accused persons.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the Postbote of the Ukrainian Director of the Delta Trió Kft., a non-foundable fuel and vehicle trading company in Budapest.
This company should have issued several invoices on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the Surveillance Authority, the cash investment Kft from Kiskunhalas has been the buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to be awarded the company documents also by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Cubatov was to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH, to the Associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány, and to their countervalue itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian murders to Iván Kubatov's express wishes.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the accusation, was due to lack of contracts.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: On request of his complication, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as atlass and Y-Generáció.
Totally, Kubatov 15 invoices in total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade should have issued to the organisations.
The state lawyer assumes that Kubatov could have cashed 10% of the total of the accounts and VAT each.
Cubatov should even have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to the application of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért gave their applications to the socialist party's organisation, Táncsics Mihály Alapitvány ("TMA").
Both received 500 000 forints each, but these amounts have benefited from abroad.
In order to do this, they have presented five fictional accounts of the Works Team Kft..
These invoices were also ensured during the examination of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now estimated by some accused persons with a statement of the procedure for the failure of the accounts, as they have already been delegated before the lawyer.
A sensation could be if the main prosecutor of Jáno's grant to a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already said several times to report comprehensively about everything, his consciousness is still out.
So the question remains open, whether this is in its interest, whether the socialists have completed a package with him on the reconciliation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is willing to take over the responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that a grant now plays the "reasoned" after his search for mildness of arrest and house arrest had fought to deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage with economic offences and have not paid them, are on free foot or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains rejected.
The psychology of survival - or why we are ready to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers are inclined to spend more and thus to overestimate the error.
Neurologenic and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" Magazine, people do not want to get hit in a competition, such as an increase in eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological schema of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto, while the others participated in a player action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain line, was measured in losers of the auction, where the survival of the opponent plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the increase in prices was explained by avoiding an overreaction to the Striatum.
In order to undermine their constraints, the economics in the research group have also undertaken investigations for the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups against a partner should be offered under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the fair value of the product, afterwards they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars reward, in case they are a winner from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between two groups was simply that the emphasis was on one on the profit, while the other was on losing.
However, as a proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologs, the members of the group of the "thin losing" group were ready to make higher efforts than those in the control or the "winning" group.
"These results can be derived from no previous economic theory.
Indeed, these have just reasoned the practices observed in auctions with the joy of gaining, or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the formative neurological procedures, so we now have a third declaration ready" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the New York University Economic Faculty.
Hepatic: When should the doctor be visited?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatic is the collection concept for various viruses infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowishness are common, but the influences and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogens, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different types: for hepatitis A and E through the dilution tractor (e.g. by contaminated foods or water), for hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses may be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, shield secret or spice).
Travelers are recommended to vaccine against the viruses A and B at least, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after the consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by unwelcome, weakness, stomach pain and fracture.
Then the yellow occupy on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and healing can last up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die annually in hepatitis B, much more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates are that only every tenth infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatic C may also have serious consequences: untreated may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the influential destruction of the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Consequently, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more frequent: those who have undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug dependents and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases worldwide is estimated to 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory study, it is recommended to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
At the time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thus burning the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004, for the first time of patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness for this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious belief acts like a type of "small" that already should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists of the Oxford University have performed an interesting experiment: It has been studied in how much faith in God affects human pain feelings, reported the British leave "Telegraph".
During the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while studying a painting of God’s mother.
As the results showed, believers were able to disable the majority of the pains.
Through a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for pain regulating.
The study was the first in a research project, which, in addition to scientists, also involves philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
When attempting, the students were attached a sparkling device to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: one of the pictures of God’s mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would produce a kind of religious trance, while they chose Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as calm.
The experimental persons spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time, they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages while either looking at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt "in security" when they looked at the mother of God, as if they were "careful" and they had felt "ruhe and peace".
During the view of the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than they had seen Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that you could also produce similar effects with other, strongly-acting images, even with the atheists, you would have to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find a picture that causes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practitioner of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image Leonardos or other comparable painter would have on the pain regulating of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about yourself
At the time of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fog and right: she is found in the bags of people as about her heads at heaven: she knows where people have spent their vacation, to which specialists they go and what they move.
And that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google.
In the direction of skeptics who are suffered by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets outline: these would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data about users and thus to draw closer to the company's original goal, which they want to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after 10 years of world change work, Google is still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status of Quo in five years, Schmidt meant that he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs are not yet able to know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms were recorded during their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited sites.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search course and resort to it later so that the meetings can be generated much more precisely, and on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" that the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you check what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that affects fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to reject the power that is based on rejection in many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search words are not only stored but also transmitted to third parties in the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradise example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, while Google gave the Brazilian government information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization EFF, successfully moved against the FBI before the Court: therefore, in the future, Google cannot be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request.
(Allerdings, the Federal Government has successfully resulted in the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been held back to the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list to two months.)
Google's image is therefore controversial: Those who are dismissing their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacy through the use of the Google services, the company is convenient to the conservative companies.
Yet, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not request its users codes, in contrast to Microsoft, and its services are available free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems to be far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software gigantics.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet's sharpness of measurement - a relationship that has been focused in particular in the past years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing but collaboration, speaking, the users deliberately leave tracks and use the available communication channels, and even though the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
A average youth can at the same time manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually include all of this in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallery that are placed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When viewing the party photos of the last night, the friend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is released because in his blog he makes only too honest his concern about business management air - one is sure: the term "private" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he awards from himself - so in some way you could form the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And whoever is trying to keep something secret, or even the Google Monopol, can like to do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that is accessing the Google search engine, but deliberately no tracks left.
Not few people are deliberately not registering on Community pages so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile by the user.
However, the public opinion is bound to wait until Google shows her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the more and more rapidly introduced services are not only providing Microsoft, but also other software developers head breakdowns.
Critical viewers, however, also find the alarming counterpoles: For example, the group leadership has rejected a protest of employees entirely after the fees of the firm-owned children's garden have been doubled, the management also meant that the multi-measurement of the employees is too expensive, but all this is just too courageous against the fact that Google was even going to knee before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all regime-critical meetings, or those who would contradict the good taste, were filtered.
The group's internal regulation is that no new service is provided in advance but only if it is already available. However, the events of the next months and years could recreate a lot: While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archivering project is currently taking into account that the company will soon have to interfere with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system that enables the creation of a complete health profile from founding, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best orwelling manner in which a human being will be terriblely accomplishing thanks to Google's data.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ozd to remove tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ozd, the police have now consulted two young people who are suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the speaker of the Police Commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were firm and are currently in charge of the aid.
According to information from the MTI News Agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken in investigation on Sunday.
The man is urged to have murdered several people out of grace.
During the investigations, it has been found that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he attracted his believer to a land in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a hidden weapon on the door.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the gun and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Börse offers purchase for Prague's Börse
Approximately EUR 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warschauer has offered the $100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaws are entirely the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wishes to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
After reporting the Czech daily newspaper "E15" the Polish Offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Exchange and the German Exchange offers have been made.
Petr Koblic, Chief of Prague's Exchange said last week that by all interested parties the Warsaw's exchanges would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not even exclude that in the future this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Exchange to 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the agreements of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The financial crisis from the view of European newspapers
In its comments on the international financial crisis that continues to be devoted to, on Tuesday, some leading European leaves were already spoken of "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster we ought to blame the President of the United States, meant "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to make his own party for the draft law behind himself, which should bring some relief into the distressing situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billions' hard investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also place the sinsbock in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leadership is responsible for the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to break together, and under which the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after voting at the Congress, threatens that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer let the threat be disregarded, the Geneva means "days-shower".
Even though some countries could provide their money-based institutions with savings packages and save the banks with the money of taxpayers from the bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are still more banks, then no further financial talks or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, the EU Member States must jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening money institutions, the Vienna's "The Standard". Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, the European taxpayers should now take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not seriously dealed with the crisis that is now a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "Retters" would not have to "shoul with several hundred billion euros" immediately, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to take the money of taxpayers in order to turn off an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which the Nissan engineers of Hummels were inspired in creating new accidental systems.
In collaboration with the Tokioter University, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by authoroboters of type BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collision.
In the flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of bees, which can see in every direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identified obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately implies the collision avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in second break parts, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike the systems of the past, this manoeuvre takes place instinctively.
"If not so, the authoroboter could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the authoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the protective sign - a layer that is currently considered unavoidable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees if they avoid other bees.
And that's what's going on in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the exception cannot be upward, downward, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the turnability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open here to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the rotation movement, or the acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have longer life than traditional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save them.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manöver, so that it takes only a handful of KB memory.
No Gigabyte and Megabyte hard memories are required.
This is the first step in developing the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimate, will be seriesly in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find technology in the GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading it to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar Saving Package Act is available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight East Coast, the Congress members, after several days' debates, agreed on the 700-million-dollars' heavy rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American parliamentary House, and said that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
As a result, Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said: The programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but it must be done more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the salvation of the Wall Street, but about shaping the voice of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, so, Washington's time Sunday evening 8 (median European time Monday 2 p.m.), but did not trigger high-speed flights on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the parliamentary House first votes on the draft law for the stabilisation of the economy from 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme declines from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be spent once for the purchase of fauler, with credits charged.
In a first tranche, the maximum half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the convention is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum should be used for the purchase of credit cards, bad securities, and over the next 100 billion USD the President should decide.
The programme is reviewed by a own Commission, which is also the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time buy bad loans, hypotheses, and hypotheses charged with securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry have reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme guaranteeing the concerning funds and paying the fees of the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the funds needed so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as immediate aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that is caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now on state aid can expect that their finishes, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake, will be reduced by the government.
A reduction in wages will only be made in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the framework of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the Executive Board of Banks is disposed of to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of faulty loans, the government will be aggressively activated in order to ensure that the managers will not be overdriven.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people are involved in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that reductions are regulated by law by managers, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights to the participating banks, so that the risks for taxpayers are lower, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank are recovered.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how taxpayers will return their lost money from the financial sector.
There were, however, skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers at any time, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were advanced by the same people, who are also responsible for the collaps of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices increased further

The sales prices in the country have been slightly increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a few - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly in bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, in shoes prices increased by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices in plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices in chemicals and production (1.6 per cent).
A price reduction was reported in raw oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical devices (0.9 per cent), and in small terms in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing were unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the main domestic markets in the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry are considered in the annual comparison, prices in the raw oil processing have increased most (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, drinks and tobacco was 11%.
A price reduction was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical devices (0.3 per cent).

The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and on-use sector compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was observed, in the investment goods a price reduction of 1.4 per cent.
The industrial export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but the annual comparison decreased by 3.9 per cent.
Compared to the euro, the domestic currency grew by 1.7 per cent, to the dollar by 7.1 per cent, and compared to the course of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent, even by 15.9 per cent, compared to the euro.
No more visa in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the American-Sungary Visum Agreement to enter into force around the 12th year, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their opinion is "they all depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in a timely manner in the overseas".
It also stressed that there will be no entrance permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The leader of the Hungarian diplomat has negotiated today in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give her the "Mediterranean Cruise with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also has discussions with the foreign-political advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican president John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support savings packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, have granted their support on Sunday for the 700 billion dollars heavy bank savings package. However, there are politicians who also require the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the government have announced after day-long Marathon consultations on Sunday tomorrow that they have come to an agreement on the Bank Retail Package.
The crisis of the Wall Street, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suitable than the opponent in order to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to economic topics, while McCains High, who has made his presentation of Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was molding at the same time.
At a election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will adopt the law of 700 billion dollars.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that it supported.
"We have to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, the whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35.000 viewers.
He did not fail to mention McCain's economic visions as "obsolete".
In an interview given to the transmitter ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have hard to cook (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the finishes for top managers - something that he had on.
The CBS said Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the parliamentary house is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking space
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (fig.de)
Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned policeologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein Huber Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bayern over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
It was surprising that the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something ended, but it was already quite exactly ten years ago: the doubtful hegemony of a government party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU has landed at 47.7 percent and has fallen under the fifty-percent market for the first time since the fifty-years.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Federal Day elections, i.e. still in the much quoted Stoiber-Era.
Modernisation consistently operated by the CSU in the country has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had projected this 40 years ago, but they were considerably damaged at the rate, but without any impact, secularization, the result of education, the rise of eastern and northern Germans to the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain on the faithfulness of CSU converters.
Modernisation is always in line with optional increases, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters in the camp became more critical and more self-employed.
It is noted that in recent weeks the classical civil groups expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abitur, such as high-level graduation.
Here CSU support decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in their "Who with whom? Party chiefs retaining in coalition questions" articles on the chaotic internal position in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ shows itself open to conversations in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the leaders of the parties were hardly able to look into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very likely - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP Chamber as a vice-cannant, gave Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have elected the Schüssel-Molter course.
Repeating this direction would not be questioned.
But murderers have responded carefully to red offers.
Cooperation could not be frustrable, he said, if Faymann tried to mix into internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently fully open, and these questions should be discussed on the internal ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," says Haider.
Jaróka: The devil circle of poverty and Segregation must be broke through
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Gender Equality, which is directed by the EU Presidency of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Members of the European People's Party, especially the educationegregation, since this is one of the most serious infringements that Roma children face, and this is the greatest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Fidesz Members reports, Járóka has noted that, in addition to discrimination in the job search, Roma would be disappeared primarily because of its low level of education from the labour market.
"The majority of the Roma youths have no middle school education, and thanks to a bad basic school education, only a small part of them can reach a graduate."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human rights to be a key role in the forming of other human rights.
Investment in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The Members believe that it is important that this context becomes aware of the widest possible circle - Roma and non-roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts the school, the more its chances to become a productive member of the labour market, and by means of income and turnover tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and sealed teaching must be set" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member stated, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deegregation process in the educational sector, which is essential for proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-righted citizens," Jaróka urged.
Since the congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for pre-establishing the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, as defined in the "European Year of Equality of Chances".
CSU: Grace at time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the electoral debtor, no heads were rolled at the top of the Bayeric CSU, the staff debates have been broken.
Commander Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace takes.
The fate of the Tandem after the disastrous 17% loss of voice will be decided on the day of the extraordinary party last October week.
However, the much educated duo already lets see that it doesn't want to stick on their seats.
They want to address the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority one day after the "Bayerian Tsunami".
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career level, the Christian Societal Union reached 60.7 percent. However, now, one year after the punch against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "aloneregator" in Bayern, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern country of the Hungarian economy, they will have to be governed in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of partial restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer will also be attached to the exploration team, which leads to a possible coalition with the liberal FDP, or the legally justified "free voters".
A irony of the fate is the same as that with the list of "Free Selectors" that Gabriele Pauli enters into the law, whose anti-stone appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo has first used to then reconcile the targeting politician unpleasantly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who hitherto pulled the threads out of the background, becomes an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called the "bitterest day of his political course" on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous comments towards CDU - he believes that the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not reposed on the legs with a common force act, Merkel cannot be re-administered after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hole from its disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
With 18,6 percent, the SPD has reached its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukchenko-Opposition: 110-0
At the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has made it.
Russian observers believe that this is a matter of prosperity and stability in the country leading by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects law irregularities in the telling of the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the Legislatur of the 10-million inhabitants has come out without opposition for decades. However, the counterparty gathered under the name "Unified Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has hoped that Lukchenko, who already renewed his presidency mandate for the fourth time in 2006 at the unclear elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment, would allow some members of the opposition in Parliament to "administer" this time.
That is why the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycoats.
Ukraina is increasingly dependent on the rising prices of the land gas imports from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans were taken into account, and the country also agreed to the Russians the sales of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country. In the light of the expectations of the opposition, the Ukraina hoped to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukchenko and other high-level politicians have been classified as the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
The OECD elections evaluation report, in which the emphasis was more on the positive movements, rather than on the defects - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, on Monday, the OECD's rapid report criticized the campaign - therefore oppositional should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all, the opposition is able to recognise a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were set on free foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to refuse the recognition of the independence of the fragile Georgian provinces of Southern Eastern Ocean and Abchasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, which has regarded both areas as independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and a backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkewitsch on our sheet.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty people have been afraid to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way to sell stones, yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkewitsch in view of the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensionists agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only benefit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and to the increase in trade deficit, it is only a question of time until the "social security" that comes to the silence of a Friedhof begins to break," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, declared the News Agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now of work is frozen"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are turnable doors for the entrance and exit of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those Schlaumeiers, who will first stamp and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Ministers.
">"Drewable doors are a means of increasing the efficiency of work through a higher presence rate and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now starts a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta again underlines.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of the turnable doors is also of great symbolic value."
From the officials sides there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, collaboration came from all sides."
So everything in all there is no breakfast anymore during the working time; end with coffee or Croissant .
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 p.m. works miracles."
During a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della)
by Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months, the absence of officials has reduced to 50%, i.e. 60.000 people per year are present in work".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage-Dynamicans - so the Minister - were twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far beyond inflation rates."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined together to cooperate with the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"Where the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures on smaller absences at work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulpelze' grow uninterrupted.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have joined together in order to explain the war against the decisive standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related disease; so also the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker, which can be carried out on control visits and further aspects of the Ministry's innovations.
Napolitano: "Prophylaxis against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day there are 2500 accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 remains life-long invalid.
For 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto nazional contro gli gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents of work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as it is caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be the 58th national day for the victims of accidents in order to focus the attention of social institutions and media on this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data and the tragic news that are spread by Anmil confirm the decisive question of prevention at work." confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazionale nazional mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention of jobs, to protect the injured workers, to support the victims' families and to sensitize public opinion".
"A delicate "Bast" has raised this; understandably in tragedy that, measured in its order of size, triggers some reversals in the media and the participation of the public. However, the everyday reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not forget that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The number of initiatives for direct awareness in the school framework are particularly important for young people who are living in the labour world.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness.
On his part, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of labour-related deaths represents an urgent social disaster which forces the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data of work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is much too high," stressed the President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you are actually doing too little to contradict the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform the workers who are already starting at school."
"A further effort is necessary - so he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater responsibility of the employers' sides is asked against a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also came to speak on "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of accidents" and prangled the "absorption of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return a guarantee on insurance to the employee so that the fate of the victim of an accident of work will not be dependent on voluntary or random donations determined by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: Hazard of hearing damage
Listening to sound music over a longer period of time with portable musical devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This reports to the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report published in Brussels.
"The report – as stated in a comment – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical devices for at least five years a week will risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume, their hearing without knowing it unreasonably harmful," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific findings – as is said by the EU – show a clear risk that is excessive for rapid action.
What really means is to sensitize consumers and make this information common.
In view of these scientific knowledges, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and take steps with the new technology."
Brussels had ordered the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical devices among young people.
"Scientists - so conclude the EU communication - confirm that they are too concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people better from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment that limits the level of noise from portable musical devices to 100 dB. The concerns about the damage that could come from a too large noise load.
You can limit these damages very much in which you can handle solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the sound viewing.
In their report, the European Scientific Committee pointed out that if the users of portable musical devices hear only five hours a week loud (only 89 decibel) music, the legal limits are already exceeded that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This amounts to 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the starting committee to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, in March it should be over, and in June the balance will be drawn.
This is the course for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome" set by the Kapitol. The Commission has hit herself in the new seat behind the Caracalla themes this morning.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project will be completed, the City and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able in June to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capitol and the captain of Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains by the City and Municipal Council.
There is no new distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve because such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - so announced the Mayor - we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission."
Anyone questioning the Commission's competence, as the Commission's opinion lacks binding, Alemanno responds: "All things depend on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If it, as in France the Attali Commission, delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deal with the everyday problems and emergency situations that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of view to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome emphasizes how much to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to thought. It will occupy the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city a quality jump - which it really needs - and thus to do a common step in the future."
A future, as the captain of Rome, that "does not only limit itself to the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropole and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician, who is much about being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States, and who maintained relations with the confined Islam (and still do this as a private man)."
The attacks against Obama become more and more intense, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A Miami lady wrote in a Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very freaky: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators as a whole!"
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good President? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great predecessor.
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the chain we will know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here is an American mentality that has been kept hidden until the end.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crews, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Something that was never heard before – only now when the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error has Bush committed during his office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq.
America's changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a trip to the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness point.
He who will take his office is faced with a huge task.
United States. The financial collapse leaves his tracks with journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the reductions. And many accuse the Internet, the "mörder" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were consulted by the PEW Research Center on their situation and mental control.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain the concerns of the information relating to the constituents because of the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, not significantly shrinking.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and executive seniors of the pressure press believe that journalism is on the wrong way at national level.
In the local area, it is even 65% in the executives.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction of the web.
The main publishers are going to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to want to join the new technology in the hope of "they bring something good for journalistism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the chief actors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chief players at national level are sure to share their values with them, while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who fear losing their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The theme of the "safe work" in the team (our "decactors", note d. Red.) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters, the employers as they are popular, and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The chief players are very often receiving very high wages, but the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pensions and insurance.
As regards the vacation, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they confess themselves, will often be "sick" during the year.
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: DIRECT TO ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate maker, which had requested to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppola because of bank root in the context of the investigation of the counter-contract in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted to a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be moved from the province city into a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such discouragements (which the lawyer had spoken to him) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain a prosecutive evidence to him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the parliamentary Chamber voted against the 700 billion spare package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the republikan party distinguishes more and more in its ancient and moderate East Coast Seal, which always favored the state institutions and business community, and that neoconservative, who is enemy against them in Washington and the financial world and wins in the south and the centre of the states choosers.
This part of the party is due to its rise v.a. the voice of it which I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the present economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the United States, even in the west and perhaps beyond it will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-frighted events, which eventually accept and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unhöred renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments: how to behave to the families concerned, which are also a huge chooser mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically against it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been in the face of itself and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, does not know a common way to find.
Therefore, all of us are now expecting the intervention of their own state; saving plans, new rules, and, for example, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the United States in the economic situation are to save themselves without foreign assistance.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimation to use them: thus two non-compliant conditions – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to fall in the same way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is perfectly in line with the increasing importance that is recently associated in the economy with a very closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradox is it right now, when we were so convinced that we had entered into a networked wholesale, in a realm of ever differentiated technologies, of intangible technologies, that we must at once find out how our future will be increasingly dependent on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are still at the extreme point connected with a tightly written piece of Earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or free of oil.
I am now coming to the second news, but it requires a short call.
Who's Territory, who's government, who's saying politics, says that also leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected Leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to control things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing leaders, such as those of the economy, which have disappeared as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, a deeply sufficient and in some sense still alarming aspect is: a loss of trust, an innocentness, an image of inappropriateness, a feeling of remoteness, which all focuses on a whole class of Western governors.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is the way that it is not only the acts of the social elite, but already their ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is more and more foreign and overcome.
So the demand for Leadership is undergroundly a devastating but powerful movement of the elimination of the leading class and conventional political establishments. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolte" of the voters and in the immediate turning of the collective state of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American parliamentary against Bush (and may also play a role in the victory of the rights in Italy).
The impression is that the old Elite, its parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and, therefore, less representative value on what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and still strengthened from the financial crisis and driven up to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be overdriven to speak about a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The superkleber that lets go up on walls
The forces of gravity thanks to the victory of a sticker and to be able to climb walls up like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the goal.
With an area of just 2.5 qcm, researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, using a special carbon structure, called carbon nanore tubes.
"The principle of the climb can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic herbs, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as Glass Teflon and Schleif Paper have shown that the new stick is ten times higher than the holdability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "remove without problem from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton University of Engineering Sciences.
"This material could be used as degradable cleaving", adds Liming Dai.
Sometimes like Spiderman to empor walls? Maybe already, but researchers rather think of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the area of space.
So for the moment the super heroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART of RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, devoted to a new climbing species.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a climb of microfibres that cleanses itself like hair by moving on a surface itself from dust and keeps always a perfect liability.
Medicinal products: never take fruit juice
Caution of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin riches v.a. in the summer, may cause serious health damage when they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the intake by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packers and fresh fruit juices in connection with medication intake. In the context of the 236th meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he rehearsed alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the acceptability of certain vital medicines in so far as it is practically eliminated and thus threatened the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurologic medicines to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN GEFAHR – The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients from the risks of this mix two years ago, and stressed the need to observe what will be drinking in connection with medicines such as diazepine or methadone.
DO NOT HAVE GRAPEFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contains substances that can inhibit the medicinal products.
The list of obstacles to the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, Director of Università Statale di Milano: "Some results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still unclearness, to have no shoe to ask a pharmacist or doctor," the expert on the Ansa Agency stresses.
Economic Nobel Price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who is teaching at the University of Princeton for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a lead article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attackers.
A prediction that has not received a few polemics as an answer and has been held to the economist years later, but today has proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandales has disappeared from the public view field in the context of Enron or Worldcom's collapses," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, which is particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsofts Office an increasing number of users, both at home and at the office, both among free-sourced and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the audience: in addition to a revised and now sparthanically designed start menu, one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is now reached, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Attention was also made to compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those who allow it to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e-mail sending. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphics editing modules and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
This is how you can generate "hybride" PDF files which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now be edited more handy by different users, thus avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a fracture to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the cloud, while the final result is to be published in the next weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, the freeness of charge could be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it has just been in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the large throw: at last, various public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking a training offer, which means optimal aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word related text generation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at an explosion of Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded at 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Coal also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new Doping Fall mi framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian sporter Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner Team, who is a third class and winner of the best climb.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who has been tested positively on Cera, the Epo of the third generation. This was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis of the blood samples of coal is one of those that have been performed in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and announced, according to the Associated Press, the Austrian competitors.
The 26-year-old Austrian went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climb.
The theme: The New YORK TIMES asks: IS ITALIAN RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the only country of the migrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with a struggle.
Do this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated all to the topic of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had clothed a package of cookies.
The case proves to what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the largest support of the Lega Nord".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and for the faster designation of illegal immigrants is also referred to as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also emphasizes the Pope and the President of State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between Church and State to combat racism."
Students Offers up to 900-Euro per room lounge prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crisis.
According to the last study by the Sunia, the Renting Federation, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florenz, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already accepted very serious moves. The whole group of students loses their right to study so factually, since their families are not able to support them at this level," so the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities, the great demand of the students leads to a deformation of the market which also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without limits of rent price, unauthorised rentals.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in a review of taxation at lower rental prices.
In a more precise review of the investigation, it appears that there is a need for a bedroom in the district of Brianza about 450 euros in Milan; a single room begins at 650 euros (in the quarter of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or some 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, a bedroom costs averagely 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university, are EUR 250/280 for a necessity sleeping space, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices are located in the quarters around the university at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Cinecittà.
Only anyone in the outer district can save money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Neapel you need EUR 300 450 for a bedroom, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Pollinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedplace costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of hire to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a hire that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinema closes due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what happens at the moment in the large city centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinema, which began with the birth of the great multisale complex in the periphery, in a long way means the death of the cinema in the centre. A process that appears not only irreversible and irreversible but also the moves of a cultural crime.
Most of these are historical places full of memories, "it is like a friend with which one has put back a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", which gave him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a pre-town kinos and its nostalgie, which consists of living in a well forever lost cinegoult.
The figures that the Anec, the central trade union, are speaking a clear language: over the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema has to be closed; these cinema paid most of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florenz, 9 in Milan, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinema, followed by Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41.
This proves that the main guilts are the multiplexkinos, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinema has been registered: with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardei has the lists, 81 are both in the Toscana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in a irrational manner," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "though it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all is the receipt of the already existing, because closing a hall in the city, are not all its family customers ready to visit instead of the old multiplex kino in the periphery.
And here remains the lack of the fund for the trade union: the debt burden recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral position that the government does not comply with the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million in the year of need."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinema, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The predicted measures include tax advantages for the cinema drivers as well as benefits for the audience on the nearby transport: it will be allowed to travel to the restricted areas of the centre and park more favourable parking fees.
"It is a joyful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But surely, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to dispose of the super power of the multiplex halls, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that brought me to the founding of the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass over at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to side to not have to see the dust-covered plaques.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Calabria Antimafia authorities against the Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his vice-president Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for mafia business.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the Clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who carries the same name as the chief of the Clan, has already been condemned for the involvement of criminal associations of the Mafia, to an amount of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard disregarding," the lawyers write, "had the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advice."
"So the Mafia group had been made possible – such as the judges – to enter the Council houses officially and to co-determine public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabrien Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than one exception to connecting local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white West."
The arrests of today's morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the Clan Piromalli police, they were excurred.
Since the end of April the municipality council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but the local politicians of their municipal offices had already been removed in 1991 – and then due to claimed links between organised crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected to the head of the central coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted Scandal as the prefectur ordered the resolution of the municipality Council.
He was interested in the Vice-President Marco Minniti, who he urged to have discovered everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with the arrest order of today's morning that the Piromalli-Clan even had been able to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the investigations in the case of Dal Torrione, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known as a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus the public administration measures became identical with the interests of this clone."
When the energy escapes from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-decorative source of money that covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and seems to understand this only now the world's large energy companies.
Wells, flows and times are the new renewable sources of energy that are now looking for all, and also seeking occupation, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price broke in 1980, the idea of maritime energy was lost, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power stations.
In addition, the flows and times would still be.
Gigants at the attack.
The first company that now puts on sea energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now increasingly more companies from the traditional energy industry that put on maritime energy gain.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – as the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the possibility of working with us."
This is about the acquisition of an authorisation from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project before the coast of Alaska.
This is a not too underestimating sign, for example, when you remember that just in Alaska, oil is continued to be promoted by the United States and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drills.
Besides Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; are the details not known, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
More improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the outbreak, not least because the last doubts of environmental protectors have not yet been explained.
Until now, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a smaller dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of connected bones.
The shot of the waves, which move the bones up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming pool over plumbs and cylinders.
This drives a turbine that operates a generator again.
The electricity will be sent to the coast through underwater lines.
Until now there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. A part of the energy gained could also serve for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a shopping house and a parking lot with the help of underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the periods drive the turbines, which are eating the generator by the inducing rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of possible clients is waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
Only the waves, then the times.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Electrical Exploration, deserves immediately the potential that is in times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sun radiation, and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is just the time energy that brought states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest 7,5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
