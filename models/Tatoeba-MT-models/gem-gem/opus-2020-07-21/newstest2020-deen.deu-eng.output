Fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandie on Friday. The fire was outbreaked in the night on Thursday. Nobody was injured at the incident. The fire war was in use with about 200 cleaning vehicles.
The fire could be commanded to hold
Inlanders were called on not to leave their houses. Constructions around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemistry work on the side of hisses, additives are manufactured for lubrizol. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people are working. The chemical factory has already in the past provided hit lines - about when a leak released the gas methanthiol through 2013 and the environment largely smoked after faul eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city wastewater system.
Woman cancels her job to search 57 days for her disappeared pony
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her disappeared dog - and announced her job for it. The seven-year-old border Collie had gone out of the hotel room during a short trip in Montana. 57 days from the Hündin were missing every track - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "It was about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately run out. Probably a loud donder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days on, they were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as post employees to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flirt"
57 days after Katies' disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already gone. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly standing her cabinet under a tree. "I just armed her. I didn't want to let her go," King said, "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. The people stopped in their vehicles, went out and armed us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Loss in the Bundeswehr: Machine weapons disappear without scratch
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still disappeared.
In the past years, the Federal Army loses numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots Munition, including three machine guns. The stay is inclinable in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "angry" scale.
In the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing - many of them have been unsaved. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20 000 shots Munition. This is a list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which is reported by the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared. The remaining disappeared weapons and parts of the arms are among other things six machine weapons of type MG3, 11 guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 weapons pipes of type MG3 are missing.
The magnitude of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal war was "angry," said the left-day parliamentary Martina Renner. This would be more, since in the course of investigations was hardly detected. The left-hand politician spoke of a "dark balance". Renner criticized that at the listing was unrecognizable whether, under the disappeared ammunition, those who were found in connection with the investigations against the suspected federal war officer Franco A. were recently condemned because of the ownership of this Munition, "and that even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned," Renner said.
Oil tanks "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tank "Stena Impero" has left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitively showed, the tank was in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was declared as a destination in the United Arab Emirates.
The tank had actually been released on Monday by the Iranian government, but he was first continuing in Iran waters. From the reedery it was said that one wanted to wait for an official statement from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was put on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Gardens in the Hormuz Sea Road under the preliminary ruling to have violated security rules. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of a Iranian oil tank before the Gibraltar belonging to the Great Britain.
The street of Hormuz is one of the world's most important roads. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region had been much worsened over the past months. Trade shipping was in the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tanks and drohnes.
Merkel appreciates the courage of mankind in the peaceful Revolution
President Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR, who had gone to the road 30 years ago at the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have brought the DDR regime to the wake, Merkel said at a festive act of the Thüringer CDU Group on the coming day of German Unit in Erfurt. The office reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi-Centrale. "The state security was taken of the horror," she said.
Musk strives delivery record
Teslas Quartal may keep record ready. Despite the delivery tree there were last losses in the electric autogroup.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electrical autogroup with the prospect of new record numbers strongly boost on the exchange. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the "Electrek" industry blog to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars fast to the customer. To this end, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. So strong the course has not been in place for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this purpose, six-digit numbers have to be made during the current and next quarter year. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kitten ourselves
A type of brake in the big brake prevents people from cocking themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. It has also been made progress on the question why children are so violent against the kitting, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the closer reaching a pinching hand triggered before the touch of laugh. This lies on a deep layer in the great brain, which already triggers the laugh at the expectation of the throat.
According to previous research, rats responded to "Laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are cooked by humans. This "Laughter" is communicated by the part of the great brain which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is underpressed during self - touching
Until now, the Berlin scientists have found in the experiments on the rats that the laughs, as well as the activity of the area of the great brain, are being underpressed during a self-removal. This is also the case when living beings are put themselves. During the external touch and the throat of the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been strengthened.
However, passing the self touch and touch by others at the same time, should the laugh also be oppressed. This pointed out that the brain of the rats could not just distinguish between the self touch and the touch by others. The new findings were drawn to the fact that people couldn't kiss themselves, because the self-relation actives a brake in the great brain.
The rats had also been trained to kitten themselves. Therefore, they sometimes broke this initiative in the experiment in advance, showed escape behavior or a terrible star. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzling is a behavior reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster disappeared: Great fire in French chemicals deleted
The large fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This informed the prefectur of the Normandie of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken out at Thursday in the night.
According to authorities, no health hazardous substances should have been exposed. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. Nobody was injured at the incident. The fire war was in use with about 200 cleaning vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
Inhabitants were called on not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.

In the past, the chemical factory already provided bars - about when a leak eliminated the gas methanthiol through 2013 and the environment widely after faulty eggs smoked. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October, Brussels should not apply to its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
About Cox, which had been used for the rest of the United Kingdom in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's mind and again this country would be to carry out the EU's exit." Cox had been murdered by a legal exhibitor during the referendum election campaign in 2016.
Mahnmal to attacks by Oslo and Utöya are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial is revealed on Saturday in Norway for the honour of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose reproductions. You remember the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the judgment in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses were shot by people from all over the world, including survivors and families of the victims. For opening, among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, the court terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first shot a auto bomb in the Oslo governmental district and after the island of Utöya, Dutzended participants of a holiday camp of the Youth Organisation of the Social Democratic Workers Party. Overall, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN General debate did not bring a solution in Iran's conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tank "Stena Impero" in Iran could be stuck back in the lake. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iran's President Ruhani.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Reederei Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now drives for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. By lunch, the ship has left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV broadcaster SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Garden had set the tank on 19 July under the presumption of neglecting the rules of the maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing the same, said Hånell. They had been working professionally in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The reconciliation now works to bring them back together as soon as possible with their families.
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar after the "Stena Impero" fixing it: in early July, there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, to be put to the chain. The delivery was due to dismiss the authorities against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received the notice of the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "Piraterie" and threatened with consequences. In the mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutations that it was dealing with a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, showed London vehement back.
The street of Hormus is one of the world's most important sea streets. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region had been much worsened over the past months. Trade shipping was taken into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear conflict of both countries stands. The Americans suggest the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States was in 2018 out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from the construction of an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has undermined the lead in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and extended agreement.
Because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace on Hormus's roads at the UN volunteer meeting in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers.
India builds a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predetermined as "war winner". In view of the criminal duties imposed by the US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers are forced to be reconciled in the People's Republic. Financial heads of Asian companies considering to move their production from China into another country, India is called in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has certainly not only to do with the irrespectives of the Chinese-American trade war. With a gigantic pile of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created as to play a major role in the global widely distorted production chain.
But now India itself has been focused in Trumps. From Haudegen in the White House devalued as the "Königreich der Zölle", America took off the threshold country at the beginning of June the commercial advantages for 2000 products. The United States prohibitively inspect India of high duties and demand a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rainy with India is freely an advisory place. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy brilles. Delhi and Washington combine the concern of China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In front of this background, a salve of American criminal duties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened These that open markets accelerate economic development has a serious standing in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reform eifer is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic error, which in the multi-voluntary state has been too long in the entrepreneurial spirit. Corporations now receive fast construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a stronger insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating both companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five mode years, economic optics in India have made a lot better, but in trade policy, this is not true. This is because of protecting internationally low competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, modi of the Nimbus of the energy reformer, which is radically renewed its country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows all too well which vocabulary western managers like. In the core of the "India First" Advocate, however, never declined from a protective economic policy, which prevents the force of Indian companies to eliminate anachronistic courses and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive thanks to the defect of their industries, belong to the stam electors of Modis Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and congrate this short-looking policy.
Addition of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French presidency, Jacques Chirac, is intended to be attached to a report in Paris the next week. The former Head of State will be held on Monday at Montparnasse Friedhof in the south of the French capital, the news Agency reported AFP under the call to the Chiracs family. It will take place in close family circles. For Sunday, a public sadge in the Pariser Invalidendom, as media reported.
Targeted the competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light-athletics-WM
The world's peak was long in the end of the goal, when in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium, the heartwarming scenes were played. In the first preceding of the men over 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swallow dangerously. He could hardly hold on the legs nearly 300 metres before the target, run in unhealthy attitude, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the west African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly interfered with him and supported him the last half of the stadium round to the destination. The forces were still enough to stop the running armband clock after the target. As the scene was not already kurios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly pulled the attention of the collected journalists on himself. Schreckers he first woke out, he didn't want to talk about his hero's act. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted only to help one suffering companion. And yet he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited by the World Association. Under normal circumstances he shouldn't even start. "That is why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did that in the evening with stress - and much more intense than he would have thought. For this hero's hero will be remembered. Most of the time Dabo even left his competitor Busby the goal and voluntaryly took over the last place - more than five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Baraga, who won this precedent. At the end, it had not been used anything, because the busby, which came into the goal with much help, was disqualified just by the end of the World Leichtathletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studys there in Lisbon, arrived in order to set a personal best time at the WM in Doha. The official data was made at 18:10,87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million Mash: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, the security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairos, a increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir site were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura had protested with hundreds of participants. They were against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, suggesting the critic corruption and misecurity. A so open protest against the political leadership had not been in Egypt for years. The Spanish exile of Egyptian construction entrepreneurs and actors Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "milion march" at central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali calls for a "volks revolution". The man is also not "Guter, because he is a subcontractor for the arms millions, but his embassies.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase in two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organization spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Indeed, these figures were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and commented on the figures.
Random arrests
Many people were "willingly arrested", "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW informed arresters under the call of lawyers. The claims against the arrested are sufficient according to their lawyers from "distribution of false information" to the membership of a "terrorist association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, for HRW data, were also randomly subjects.
HRW also criticized the censur in the North African country. Hence, the government blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to spend returns easier
For online dealers, many packages are lost. Approximately 20 million returns land on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to spend back-sended products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be exempt from the turnover tax on penalties, the Ministry explained a question of the Green-Bundestag fraction, which the newspapers of the radio media group reported on Friday, but the dealers could put the market value of the incurred returnes so low that they should pay no or only a few turnover taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would return every sixth package in orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. To spend the companies would cost additional money in accordance with current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate penalties as a turnover which then applies to sales tax.
Green Fraction Manager Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister for Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies could rate non-profit products accordingly and spend freely to non-profit organizations. The companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donation. This was not only valid for online trade but also for other businesses from the fashion store to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be increased next.
For industry, Banksy's work underlines "the reproduction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic conservation of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital is to be issued until it is to be increased on October 3, and it is estimated to EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first released in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Bristol, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibitioned the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. At this opportunity, the work called "Question Hour" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million amounts.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the sub-house after the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the two-payed Brexit on 31 October, even without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is mixed into the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-eastern England, he painted an image, which represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a medium. The work sees thousands of trucks and other visitors daily at the entrance to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "travel in the park"
The strong verbal attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Resident in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election fight before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controvers are a "speaking walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy that. We will get out of the EU and we will win."
Johnson had hardly attacked Brexit consignors in Parliament in the last few days and put them to the people, among other things, "rails" and accusations that he could put the members in danger because they could be targeted by murder threats, he deceived as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to get out of the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were excited that Britain had not yet come out of the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the invited mood, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kaschmir
With a emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at its first appearance before the Uno Full Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, said Khan on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this is bad, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
Since its independence on British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of them to the divided region Kaschmir. Both nuclear powers have dominated a part of Kaschmir, another part of China. In the beginning of August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kaschmir region and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrations in Cairo demand the Sturz of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with a hard hand. It will shoot with sharp ammunition on the population, over 2000 captives were in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already inhabited there. Protesting was never dangerous in Egypt. However, since the power acquisition of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario like at the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protest in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being stumbled by the government drived millions on the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not handle, no matter how hard it is against opposers. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its values, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the greatest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produced food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people has a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have trouble to deal with a bottle of water at all.
Tüv Tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" for main city airports
Two months has been checked whether the complicated installation feather is working in the interaction with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the history, but the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is sure, Head of Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many details themes, but a real show stop we don't have." He assured that the timetable until the start of occupying is still a buffer.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large. The construction production display is now intended to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year, for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, it must continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is no release for all dives on which the cable trails are hanging. The airport manager expects it to exist until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking shortages that fall down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They have to go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then, in the beginning of the year, there should be new tests with hot gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and other wooden angels and planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should be operated in 2011. Since the beginning of 2006, costs have increased from two billion to approximately EUR 6.5 billion to opening next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the officers plan to develop the airport. Therefore, it is supposed to be in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance manager Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport funds on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for Drug Spreaded - Police takes a man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several machines in the Chemnitz city area for it! Now the acter finally sits in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket automotives in Chemnitz and the region has increased considerably. There was a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German at the Citizen Street and at the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police Speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations due to the introduction of explosions of explosions of explosion in reality with a particularly severe case of stealing, led by the chemnitz criminal police, not only confirmed this suspicion of the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemnitzer now standed eight acts.
The Police Speaker: "He seems to have financed his decay-based dependency."Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had sprayed parking ticket machines on the citizens' road.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automated bomb is now in an investigation. The police investigations against him continue to run.
Think that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Airhansa Group crushs its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with cheap flights like Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Airhansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed a press speaker of Austrian Airlines against the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Eurowing Airhansa-Billigflugger is thus de facto dissolved. From the current seven Eurowings flights, four remains in Vienna. The AUA takes over the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal from Jänner 2020. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Trails from Vienna to Germany are taken from Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA cross and network planning, explained the speaker. The flight times are intended to be coordinated on connection flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna rotary cross and to expand the decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna is only "Production Company" for the AUA group sister. This is how, among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mostly with Eurowings device. The board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and air carriers are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight numbers are no longer made in terminal 1, but as the AUA in terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, a price struggle was broke out after the Niki-Pleide. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to raise the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 aircraft. The Irish Billig Flyer sends four Ryanair Machines and Crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade union as a conversion design to the collective contract.
The battle claim by Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary that Lauda has overcome the AUA in five years, arrived on Friday AUA Board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years."

However, it is sure that the fortunation of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul becomes a similar great festival as the mourning of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study of Causes of Cardiac Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for heart-crystal diseases. But what really causes a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburg researchers want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to get more detailed on the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet include the essentially influenced risk factors for cardiac crystal diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the one of 1000 former patients of the University of the heart and vessel centre at the week.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20 000 relevant human genes, possible illness-inducing changes of the DNA - called mutations - it was known by the clinic. Every year about 200 would be added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop the initiatives to develop new options such as caution, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also benefit from researching other people's diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Cardiac and Certain Center. New knowledge is possible for interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos is currently dealing with allergies. Now on the medical campus there, a centre for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created and a professor for bioinformatics is created. For the reasons of his commitment, the Swiss logistics operator said that he had been operated in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The bioprobes of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 people, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In the inheritance decryption is strictly respected for the protection of anonymised data, scientists insured. It is about a Petabyte (1000 Terabyte) to data, said Holger Moch from the University School of Zurich.
The inheritance of a person today can be decoded within 24 hours according to the week. The pure cost of this is EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has costed several hundred million euros. The study will start on 1 October, all 9000 samples should be analysed at the end of 2020. First results will be expected in the following year.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have filled more than 300 and abused boys from a Koran School. According to instructions from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police speakers Yakubu Sabo announced. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the predecessor to be taught in the Koran and to be "hessed". In fact, the guardians of their teachers were held under "the most delightful and inhuman" conditions, Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children aged nine years, had been chained in a small room.
The Koran school was reported for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They had not been affected by the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In most of the Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They often replace the lack of state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee aid, over the last ten months, more than 40.000 people fly across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police liberated 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in the north of Nigeria have released almost 400 students from disgusting conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that pointed out torture," said the police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamicly-powered school. The conditions there had been "human invaluable". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and placed on chains. Some have been sexually abused. Television pictures showed degraded and injured students in an apparently bad health condition.
World Footballs: More claims to Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature Not Valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thereby record.
After Nicaraguas captain said that he had never voted in the world football valley, it came to the fifa from other countries. Egypt was not worthwhile - with a curiosous reasoning.
Many of the Fifa has proved to be incredible over the past years: the WM promises, dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functioners. However, the Fifa footballer valley did not so far suspect of running uncleanly - if one avoids that the voice-righted national trainers and national team captains of the membership associations are often more consumed by sympathy than by objective appreciation.
But after the captain of Nicaragua had already complained that he had not voted at all, further imperfections are now to occur: Egypt complains that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa excuses that "the signatures were given on the choice forms in uppercase letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to resolve the situation - without answer.
Sudan's trainer also surprised
As the situation in the case of Egypt is complete, the Sudanese association indicates that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not voted in the same way as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi at place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa, the vote would have taken the same way, with the signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese bond.
Pronunciation had also raised captain of Nicaraguas Juan Barrera: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case he was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The association now came to the report on Friday: Voting, but of course was no intent. The filled election documents were "fairly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguanic selection, said in a communication of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas has actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the Communication. Both Rosas and Henry Duarte team struggle had voted for Messi, "as well as in the official list of the FIFA."
The other cases now allow the fifa to be checked in an investigation, but stresses that the election process has been externally supervised by the Consulting Company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winner of the World Football Val - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian affairs: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two rank-hohe Republicanans have spoken openly for an official investigation against the U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the republikan governor of the US Federal State Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are detected." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the elimination of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the explorations. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine the activities of the Democratic Presidency candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
So far, the Republicans have retained criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have proved unpleasant because of this. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's Party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as the lighting of environmental regulations and the sharpness of immigration rules.
As a further rank-hoher Republicaner, Charlie Baker, director of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to examine the matter and to go to the reason."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. federal states, have formally failed to agree with the trial against Trump, on which the Congress is decided. Hence, their comments are particularly symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. At mid Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary Chamber, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, most disturbing." US media also reports that among the Republicans were internally first rising.
The affairs may introduce an official procurement procedure against Trump, which the Democrats in the Representative House have announced an investigation, and they are proposing him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
With its majority in the representative house, the Democrats could endeavour to a so-called imperfection, but the decision on a resolution in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. Until now, no U.S. President has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers at board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had been arrested with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 libical refugees on board unauthorized the port of Lampedusa. Following severe protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by a Italian judge after a few days.
Now, new serious prosecutions against racket are being raised. Thus, three men who are tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a recording camp in Messina (Similia) after migrants had recognised their penalties in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we have not even secured information about it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben New Builder of the German Press Agency.
In the mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, quilded and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shakanized and exposed greedy - by repeated and constant physical violence," then said the Communication.
NGOs and help organisations now indicate that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are flying from Libya. It is therefore highly likely that they are also actors on the ships. "It is therefore very important that it will be examined."
The Italian Ex-Innenminister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate excuse from Racket, against which aid for illegal immigration is still established in Italy.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electrical autogroup with the prospect of new record numbers strongly boost on the exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an e-mail published by the "Electrek" industry to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To this end, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. So strong the course has not been in place for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered some 95.000 cars and thus reached its current best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 30,000 to 400.000 cars. For this purpose, six-digit numbers are required in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
U.S. Budget dispute: Renew only a bridge funding
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and decided a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the limits of expenditure for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States stands once more before the new fisheries year beginning on 1 October. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and decided a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision on Monday at midnight, it would have come to a shutdown, a partial shutdown of the Federal Administration. President Trump must still put the decision into force.
Shutdown disabled
Preliminaryly, the Federal Administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year ending on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to take part in time on the 12 expenditure laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the new financial year of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio.$ extended expenditure framework.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the Representative House, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate has also reversed 10 of the twelve expenditure plans more or less, which are hardly able to multiply.
The spirits are particularly distinguishing on the resource allocation for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats are disturbing the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The issue of the wall construction was already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building, the spirits separate
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this question. It is more likely to be an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21, and a shutdown will not be excluded at the same time.
In view of the persistent inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and the associated risk of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. Submission S. 1877 to prevent shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the previous year level, interfere with Parliamentary travel activities and stop their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertility for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation is intended to be open to women and lesbs in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a government legislation which allows all women to take advantage of in vitro fertility, which would be expected to increase the demand for anonymous seeds.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. Also the French Bishop conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which was defended by Minister for Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It pictures the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. The idea is that the cost of artificial fertility for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Reproduction with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
On the other hand, with a sharp majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of her dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In the past there were cases in Germany where women in vainly complained about the release of the sperm of a dead one. The opposers of the prosecution in Paris argued that a so witnessed child would then have a "specially difficult fate".
On the other hand, numerous members of the governmental party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had spoken for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow would be a "double sadness" if by the death of her husband was still unfulfilled with her child's wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be contaminated with the sperm of an unknown one in the future, but not with its own partner.
Until now, artificial fertility in France is only allowed heterosexual pairs that cannot witness children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the body farmership remains forbidden.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian pairs, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for climate: calls after flight charge for Uni will be louder
The universities are flying a lot, so the country wants to make a climate charge there in the future. The directors say they don't have any money for it, but now they are also internally under pressure.

The debate on a climate charge on flights from universities and universities before the summer break is again in swing. After the national rapist conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding propulsion from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctors of six bath-württembergic universities and a pedagogical university for compensation of service flights. These are the first step "required", at the same time, there must be a wide debate on the prevention of flights, says in their opinion. The original cabinette decision already planned in July continues to be on ice because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the Secret Service FSB, the prisoners were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time there was a shot change between border guards and boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later killed his serious injuries. However, this time there was no injured, it said.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic lack of food. So the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. There Russia's coastal guard is traveling according to their own information on the protection of their sea biological resources.
30 000 ink fish captured
The re-controlled 30,000 ink fish were discovered and captured on the boats. In addition, the information was taken from three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fishing authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, according to the complaints of local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have, according to the media, been arrested there at a time this year.
The chief of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrowly-made synthetic networks in Russia. With these would also collect small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they need 200 years to be destroyed.
Recently only 18,000: USA lower asylum over limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is guarding against protective seekers: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal extraction of refugees is further reduced. Recently threatened believers and Iraq's asylum are to be received.
The U.S. Government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the arrival of new refugees. However, in the year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people are to be left into the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the admission of protective seekers from all over the world over the past years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher limits of admission had been validated.
The targeted maximum of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. However, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs called "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly reminds of the language use of the U.S. official president.
A "responsible dealing" with refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries in order to help reconstruction there, explained Trump. For his hard course in migration policy he gets much support from adherents, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border to Mexico that wants to cut down tromps. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had a national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current action and current internal developments in the U.S. capital, Trump is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj business and a potentially threatening official procurement procedure.
The U.S. Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, after presentation from the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqers who have helped the US Military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, to take up a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America in other countries apply for asylum. In this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to stop migration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court of Justice orders release from Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan woman has been moved to an admission station for human monkeys in the United States on the request of the Argentine justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was awarded the rights of a "non-human person" so it was forced to release. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human fats are not able to adapt to the life of the wilderness, it is expected to live in the release of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other Orang-Utans and 31 Shimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly housed by Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to pass a further 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. State of Cansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" in 2014 has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ocope sheet. By 2023, a research and education site is intended to create for the conservation of species' diversity.
Record for Swiss Extreme Mountains: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extreme Mountain Ride Dani Arnold has been a new house racing at the nearly 3000 metres high tin in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double soil or other means, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the great tin in a new record time.
Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise, only supporting Jeans, T-Shirt and only with absolute dizziness, so that he banned the old best mark for nearly 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European North Walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US export product manufacturer Nike has bought a significant profit plus. The net profit increased to $1.4 billion (approximately $1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the group announced on Tuesday. The new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" with which the Adidas competitor turns online to its customers.
During the three-month period until the end of August, the sales rates of Nike increased by a plus of 22 per cent in China, and thus the group of Beaverton in the U.S. Federal State of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directly address the consumer via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investment and thus increase its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football prophecy Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defense Jesus from Brazil was being suppressed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus thereafter published the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma already knows what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma attachers could never again visit a game of the association, wrote the club on Twitter.
Rassism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scanning Italian fans racism against black players of rivalizing teams. "We cannot have racism in society or sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify and throw the responsible ones from the stages," Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the weekend. At the beginning of the expression were racist singing at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
But also about the adherents of Juventus Turin, there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities now declared 38 randalian fans of record championships of Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them would no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police communicated. For the rest, then, bans from four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan-groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are subject to severe pressure, money laundering and private violence. The club had taken the investigations with an advertisement last year.
The Ultra leaders should have posted Italian media reports behind the black trafficking with tickets. They would have "military" ticket trade for the fan curve and should have pressed Juventus employees to get to more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcisstic, the generation Z is political - all years will be careful names. If you look more precisely, the awards of contradictions are stuck. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The craps come!" This call officially started the crab catching at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as the department for public work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee was known.
Gaochun, the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in organic terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun have already started crustification. In the course of the time, the crust industry has developed into a prominent sector that has ensured high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years Gaochun has actively developed a large, ecological and scientific development of crustaceans and a technology-based crustaceans. And the city has come to the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and for the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services, and the service network for "approvements under a roof, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a platform for credit granting" with care, so the city wants to optimize the environment for authorisations, for services and for development.
Gaochun is fully engaged in the development of the site's advantages by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, using the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a trailer for intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, as well as farms for organic agriculture leading in the "3+2" field. At the same time, Gaochun has improved the construction of a national, comprehensive tourism zone and of foreign transport areas of national importance. In this way, the ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun were integrated, the state of civil service and public service buildings, the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" are further developed.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani has spoken of a claimed offer of the United States to cancel penalties after his return from the UN Full Assembly. The United States had, in contrast to discussions with the Teheran leadership, put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
However, US president Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian officer on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the penalties imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: the Federal Cancer Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting should take place. "And America says I lift up the penalties," added Ruhani. The kind of penalties that should be terminated have been held at the debate. "And they have clearly said that we have all sanctions."
However, this prosecution was not made in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the existing penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. The Europeans hoped to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is intended to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump as Merkel at the edge of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 descendants
After the western Turkey was shaken within the shortest time of two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were hurt at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the past, there have been almost 200 descendants, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This will increase the concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The earthquake of starch 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and put panic in the millions of mettropoles. Now the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for bidding, said Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, badly built homes fall into - among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
City planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici warn for years that large open areas, which were registered in the centre as a refugee sites, have long been built. First on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Beben in August, Istanbul's engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul are not earth-proofed.
The epidemic centre of the Beben from Thursday was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres deep, as the catastrophe protection authority of Afad announced. A few minutes later, a small refugee took place for even more panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injury or damage had not been reported at first. The State Senator TRT showed people who run out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the District of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students wept as to see pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake threatened. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and anatolic earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of the strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. On Thursday the earthquake again met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Enterprises design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags packed with all necessary ready standing next doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes. When the next big creature comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been hurt. Some buildings had suffered light damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Katastrophe Coordination Centre (Akom). According to this, two minorities of mosques in the regions of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning before afterbidding in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. buildings wackeld. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more severe than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter from replacement. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the crew is officially indicated at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first crew, CNN Turkey said, there was a descendant, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
On Tuesday, a earthquake of the strength had 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was until Istanbul to feel. Also its epidemic center was located west of the millions of the Metropols, the Avad disaster protection authority already informed on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that took place on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul earlier or later - the tension between the tettonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will get rid of it at some point - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy calculates that the earthquake was now a warning. It would have become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the broadcaster. "From or later the great creature will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an interruption - the creature also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a huge earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at the ground sea this year the earth had beaten.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two brisant documents provide new ignitions in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power from U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official procurement procedure, the US Democrats see stronger: The complaint of Trump and its controversial telephoneat submitted by an anonymous advertiser with the Ukrainian President raises important points for research against the President. Trump itself looks once more as a victim of a "hexenjagd". In addition, he doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
United States: United Airlines air fare locked in toilets - Flyer redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilette, a flight by United Airlines has been redirected. The WC door had been blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the Airline informed U.S. media.
During an outdoor landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close cabin. About an hour she had been locked in it, U.S. media wrote to other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video that is distributed on the Internet, which is intended to come from the US media of flight 1554, it is to see how several people try to liberate the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has excused all passengers. Open was first whether the woman receives compensation.
The Cakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenesian publisher (Zürich) shared. In this it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but now is at once the most powerful man of Great Britain. He views it as his mission to transpose the will of the people in the reality and is determined to stop from nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if Ministers are shameless lying like the Soviet leaders once when Brexiteers in high positions just approach the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." By McEwan, only in the spring of the Roman "machines like me" about artificial intelligence appeared.
Kafkas 1915, published for the first time, is a story of Gregor Samsa, who awakens one morning and sees himself "to an incredibly transformed unclean cooker", being excluded from family and society and eventually endorsed. "Ian McEwan rejects Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," said the Diogenes publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluid brakes to reduce the noise load by freight trains. In addition, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's New Town and Sopron are modernised and electricized.
This is intended to make it more comfortable and to reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU's EU infrastructure peak "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels until 31 October cancelled
The German travel organ Thomas Cook has cancelled all travels until 31 October 2019 a day after his insolvency. Travels could not be "come insolvency for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday night.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, which are already paid or totally paid. As it is about travels starting from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach is examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the sog of the Pleite of the British Mother Group and had posted insolvency on Wednesday. The company, among other things Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels money from now on
However, from this Friday hotels in abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas-Cook holidays, will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidays are no longer invited for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the holidays are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zürich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This is true immediately and subject to the fact that Thomas Cook travelling from these hotels will not be requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel accounts," continued Speaker Bernd Engelien.
Insurance thus reacted to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on their own site, so some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, on Friday, the insolvent travel provider is voting, the insurance speaker said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalurlauber were travelling from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return to the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through the Zürich Insurance will only help the travelers who are still on their way. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly only in vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This was also valid for such bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about travelling with start from 1 November 2019, the company opened. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure is reviewed, it said. Basically, in these cases, the insurance is also responsible for Zurich. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zürich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website of the possibility of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims on a web form.
Prince Harry destroys bomb mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on the tracks of his mother.
With a blue splitter guard West, the British prince Harry in Angola has kicked up and destroyed a sprengmine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he made the fire circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the savanne landscape without harm. Although only the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100.000 relics of the decades of blood conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry then wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same champion who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to return the way she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day African journey that has started in the South African tourist metropole Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of non-dealing remains acute
In fact, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly stated: With him there will be no third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are in the polarizing British for eternal duration. The recent judgment of the Great Britain Supreme Court swept like a damocular sword over the Blondscope. Its suspension of the Parliament to be able to run its Brexit-Curse to the expiry date, was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliged Johnson to lead to a renewal of the bilateral discussions until 31 October. However, Johnson had gradually excluded.
Boris Johnson still thinks the deal is possible
However, the pressure seems not to pass over to Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital of Andeutions, he supported a renewal of the negotiations in the event of a disagreement until the end of October:
You know, we'll follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU for 31 October.
And best with a deal, and I'm carefully optimistic that it works.
And the time runs gradually from the Brexit dealers in Brussels. The EU and the British sub-dealers have been more than six weeks in order to prevent Britain's exit from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not achieved any interruption. A agreement seems to be more difficult at the end of October. Breaking the British Prime Minister's law does not take effect again. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could continue in the event of a No-Deal the Brexit.
US authorities: Other deaths by e cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the U.S. Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people concerned, about 500 of which confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage until now. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times, Mohammed Ali's videos were divided into online networks. The construction entrepreneur and actress in Spain calls for a "volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military that critics are proclaiming corruption and miseconomics. Ali hopes to have a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed. At the center of Kairos, there was already an increased police presence. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir site were locked. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and the phones of footers were partially searched for news and photos related to protests.
On September 20, the demonstrations also gathered around the Tahrir site.
Last weekend there was protests with hundreds of participants in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. A so open protest had not been in Egypt for years. The security forces responded hardly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) have been arrested almost 2000 people since the past week. Many of them had been randomly arrested – only because they were "incorrect time at the wrong place", HRW shared with lawyers arresters.
The organization also criticized the censur in the North African country. Thus, the government blocks Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been governing the country since 2013 after the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partly condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in the Hamburg Harbour, among other things by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the "Malizia" race hunting over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of heating on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Islands and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Yet, many have acted like a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens under exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of heating the earth and the destruction of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, was measured with a drohn of greenish glassery and fished with networks for microplastics.
For his "feature for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded a great example in the Hamburg climate week with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all of us who live on the heart of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award. "He is a witness to the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades."
Terrible Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nuddles 430 Euro
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The account of 80 Euros of drink money was paid by the two women, but they posted the resignation on Facebook, which resulted in hot reactions.
"Some cases harm Rome's sight. We urge the police to consider whether it is a fraud here," a speaker of Federagit, the association of the travel leaders in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Freiday edition).
Prompt came to the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the account. Also a drink money of up to 20 percent of the invoice was normal, the host said.
U.S. President Donald Trump could be confronted with an official procurement procedure after the turbulent detections of the past days, and the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the representative house as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be on the public. The prosecution of the Whistleblower, who has made the discussion of concern about national security and the democracy of the United States with its complaint, is monstrous: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He has exploited Ukraine’s dependency and so forced them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the now published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not return the complete words. However, the telephone record of July 25 is only a episode of a much larger history, in which the centre besides Trump is especially his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis' travel plans reports to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the president Selenskyj, who has chosen the president, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are warm. "We do not mix into a choice, we are mixing into a investigation which we have the right to," he says the newspaper. You may think it is inappropriate, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants us to pursue investigations in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "for this information is very helpful for my clients and will be able to make it possible for my government to help."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have been infected with right conspiracy fantasia, fixed on Trump's counter-kandidat at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct a cause for Russia investigations in the United States. However, this condemnation was never serious.
This is about the precise investigations that the Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice President and currently prominent candidates for the Presidential candidate of the Democratic Democrats, Joe Biden, as the Ukrainian Representative of the Obama Government, urged the release of the Victor Schokin Ukrainian General Attor at that time. And in order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, in whose supervisory board his son, Hunter Biden, was active. Biden Senior has pressed the Ukraine financially in order to destroy the corruption of his family.
Actually, the expiry was something different. When Joe Biden asked that the Ukrainian General Prosecutor should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also prompted for the deep corrupt hosts, the U.S. government was far not the only Western partner who urged his release. On the other hand, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, mostly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances.de reports users that Facebook has not been able to load again and again since about 15.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if not yet in the same range.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disorders
It's not the first massive crash this year. As in March and July, the services were out of service for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also this time, especially, take back on Twitter to make their angry air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved by the chilen air gun from the ice of the Antarctica. They were on their way with a sludge boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour the chilenic rescue helicopter needed for saving.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"We received the message at 9:30 a.m. shortly before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the sleeping boat."
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NOT charge cableless
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since more than a few new smartphones have come to the market that support cableless charges and sell themselves very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call another study from the beginning of July. The cableless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the cableless loading of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick for the devices extremely harmful. The reason for this is the significantly larger heating development. If you load a cell phone normally per cable, the battery is heating up to 27 degrees within three hours. When the cableless charge is charged, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned. If the mobile phone is a little beyond the spole, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the lading path, which moves to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of battery is a crucial factor. Then each grade plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only capacity, but it also does not last as long. Thus the lifetime is lower. Therefore, the researchers advise to always upload the smartphone per cable. As a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always connected with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of a battery exchange again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply place the device on a suitable chargepad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a disturbing cable salat and a difficult fumple. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transmission) is being implemented a global standard, with which exceptionally even Apple is involved, there are little restrictions. However, the technology should be applied only in exceptional cases, according to the researchers.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousands in six months
A nepalese mountain climb has, according to its own information, increased 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, shared his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international struggles: It comes from a photo of mountain climbs that are on Mount Everest's serpent in spring.
The image of the mass anchorage launched a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest peak of the earth. In May, 11 climbers had died at the climbing within few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climbing of the 14th eight thousand people: currently Chinese authorities lock the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather. In the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China in order to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a fervent elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protection area near the famous and many tourists visited the former rockfestation Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old to the police speaker. A autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The farmers are often farmers in which the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, approximately 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This is usually happening when the animals move near their habitat villages.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants are living in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.
Containing British oil tanks leave Iran
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" leaves the Harbour City of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detection by Iran. This was announced by the IRNA news Agency of the Bandar Abbas Sea Travel Association. The Iranian Revolution Garden had established the tank under the British flag on 19 July under the preliminary ruling to disregard the rules of the maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent economic committee of the sub-house wants to examine the plenary of the traveller Thomas Cook. It is the case of the management's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government could not be financially involved in the survival of the company. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control by external accounting officers," the Committee's chairman Rachel Reeves in London informed. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of managementgier."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of darm cancer
The role of genes in the familiar increased risk of darm cancer has seemed to be overestimated so far. In this end, researchers from the German cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are therefore likely to weigh more severely than yet accepted. This has consequences for calculating the individual darm cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk causes Tesla action to rise
This was written to Tesla employees in an email published on Thursday (local time) by the "Electrek" industry. The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, if it continues in Musks newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To this end, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors enjoyed the information: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. So strong the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this purpose, six-digit numbers are required in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Will British Government deal with Brexit law? Johnson retaining
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a deck on whether he, in the case of a reverse of the last law adopted by Parliament, seeks against an unregulated Brexit. On a question like this, he just said on Friday before journalists that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a suspension of the expiry date, no agreement with the EU should have been reached until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "Chapter Law", which is difficult to negotiate with the EU.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political Schikane" in order to cope with the law. Johnson could use a procedure stipulated by the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he seeks a contract with the European Union, "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Iran evidently runs out of uranium riches
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Partners in the conflict on the rescue of the historical Atomic Agreement. "The leaders show inability or lack of willingness for the European States when dealing with concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the edge of the UN Full Assembly in New York. In the case that they do not stand to their promises, he set out "more steps" from the agreements of the hardly negotiated 2015 Agreement.
Background is the conflict with the international agreement on the prevention of a Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counterpart of the commitment to Teheran, was to normalize economic relations. The United States went out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change the course in the nahost policy considered aggressively. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder demands and, in the meantime, react to hard sanctions against Teheran. Iran last reacted with a rehearse of the uranization restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used the centrifuges installed in early September also with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA, Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal, and therefore, the Iranians left with the costs and burden of depressing US sanctions alone, muted Rohani, but there will still be further discussions that hopefully break a solution.
Rohani continues to confront Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, on Monday of the US estimate that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Jemen had known to the attack, which was regarded as false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"The ones who raise such charges have to provide evidence for this," said Rohani. This would have been not known by the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General Debat. Instead, they would have called for only that the rebels in Jemen couldn't have carried out an attack like this. Rohani had been met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Before possible discussions with U.S. president Trump, the major sanctions of the US administration would have to be lifted, Rohani requested. He asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialog and reason".
Comet by other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep of the world. This happened once. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was only one suspect at first is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crossed by our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has raised the interest of astronomers around the world.
The largest comet was discovered on August 30 by the Amateurastronomen Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on the Krim - with a self-built telescope of 65 centuries diameter. Following observations of various observations confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which has been seen during a passage of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insight into a foreign solar system before he disappears on Nimmers. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of Canaries reported. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150.000 miles per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported about Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Authority Nasa in a notification.
The comet is based on the analyses on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of heavenly bodies. To honor its discoverer, the interstellar sweep stars, which had been first conducted under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, which pointed out that the first part of the name was the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in an approach. Thus the researchers will continue many months for investigation. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observations have already taken the visitor into the shower. Thus, a team about Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already been conducting the characterisation of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study, took the diameter of the heavenly object to 2 to 16 kilometers. Recording of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaiii shows a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers of the Canarian Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweep star, offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of the cometes of our solar system, which indicates that their composition must be similar," IAC researcher Julia de León reported. This observation shows that cometes in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, supplemented the Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stipple visitors are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors may capture a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency wants to stop the three-part space zone "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million miles away from the earth. According to Esa Scientific Director Günther Hasinger, it is supposed to run on an even unrounded, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Peking's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Pointally before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new Mega-Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, then in 2025 it will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. The recent Prestige Project of China is also called "Seesters" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing paths that are intended to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-New U-Train transports passengers in only 20 minutes to the city of Peking.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany has been relocated since 2006 - and much smaller - since 2006. However, a first passenger machine has been landed in Beijing after four years.
New oversound plane is intended to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which the British Space Agency (UK Space Agency) dreams. It is possible to make it, for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company develops Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the Office by the US Sender CNN. "This is the technology that it could definitely achieve," said Agent Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We speak of the 2030s for the operation, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate with the Australian area closer. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole is currently about 20 hours. As a single passenger airplane, the Concord had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 until the setting in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, it came to an accident at the start of a Concord at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inmates died. Last year, the US-American air carrier Lockheed Martin Pläne announced, together with the US Space Authority Nasa, to develop an overshell plane that is "X-plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed-point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also alignable outside the Earth’smosphere and thus enable the "natural generation of truly reusable raising devices".
Resurrection in Washington: Trump wants to discover anonymous tips providers in Ukraine shops
In the Ukraine deal for possible abuse of power of the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to discover possible undichte places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the U.S. Messengers at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spion" and with such ones were "a bit different" in the past.
This was considered to be an intimidation attempt to give hints. The event was not actually public. Several US media, however, spread audio media from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded to the statement of the President.
The Democrats in the U.S. Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparing for an official proclamation procedure against Trump. Their prosecutions were primarily based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee, who raises serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On large public pressure, the descriptions of the advertiser were made public on Thursday.
In its work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, which the US president uses "the power of his office" to achieve that another country is mixed into the US election 2020 for its benefit.
In the centre of the condemnation, there is a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about former businesses by Bidens son Hunter in Ukraine and claimed efforts to protect his speaker from Ukrainian justice. Bids are in the race around the democratic presidency candidate for the election 2020.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of the confusion of the Ukrainian telephony: Leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the deck. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was produced. However, after the discussion on the direction of lawyers from the White House, this was removed from a database intended for this purpose, and instead was stored in a particularly protected system. Until now only a cruel conversation protocol was published.
The identity of the advisor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA Secret Service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from second hand, which would have appeared inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no hints or spines.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, however, provoked discouragement. The president of the U.S. Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted angry and complained, Trump's statement is once more undergoing the integrity of the government.
In the Representative House for months, various committees have been exploring against Trump and its environment. In the light of the Ukraine's claims, the Democrats have now pursued research with new wake in order to initiate a possible decision-making procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump attacked ship sharply, took him a wrong representation of the things and again called for the resignation of the Chairman. Trump frequently suppressed ship and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government employees from the security and external policy area, which were more than one of the democratic, but also among republikan presidents, were in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation of a possible official proclamation procedure initiated by the Democrats. If the contempts were true, it would be "a screwless power abuse" by Trump, it said.
For the further process, there is no precise timetable. With its majority in the representative house, the Democrats could work on a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on a real office, however, in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. Until now, no US president was removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Management Council: jobs are "sleeving"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the costs in production could be at the burden of production in Germany and Europe, which drives the driver's management board. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is the cost of staff. The "Pact of Future" negotiated between companies and the Management Board in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be degraded in the case of the autobuilder if it is proved that the related activities are no longer required. In addition, employment guarantees are applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper learned from business circles, jobs in the production that are not actually to dispose are "slepening" over another way - that is, at the official course, will not be resumed.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force the re-settlement. In the meantime, there is a lack of employees who are increasing working deformation, the concerns about a gradual excavation of vehicle works would be greater. In order to increase the fear that vehicle production could be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. The VW only said: "A adaptation of the employment volume is done as agreed socially compliant along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to more standardize production worldwide and manage new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus to increase competitiveness. Production headquarters Andreas Tostmann said at a managerial conference in Berlin: "Even in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crises firm."
In this way, there are already successes: For example, this year, the production costs of each vehicle have been reduced for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production duration do not call VW, according to our newspaper, it is round at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg tribe is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works brownschweig and salzgitter finished components. For Wolfsburg's interior, the VW rule is that there must be 800.000 cars built annually so that the work is satisfyingly profitable. In 2018, however, the discharge in Wolfsburg was only for some 700.000 vehicles - contingent by the decreasing diesel demand and the problems of conversion to the new consumption and exhaust test procedure WLTP.
As Tostmann has announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars should be rolled from the band "perspectively". This is intended to enable the bundling of the golf production in the family work - because the work of Zwickau is re-establishing to the location of the e-auto production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Gulf and Tiguan have evolved last downwards. Therefore, the expectations are now on Gulf 8. It is intended to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced with Voodoo to prostitution: human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with swords, swallowed into the ruir area and forced to prostitute. Six mutate human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six disgusting human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced to punishment and penalties for up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused women from Nigeria had swallowed and forced to prostitute. To force their obedience, the travelling Nigerian women had still had to put a ritual swear in the home before a Voodoo Priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean by libyan sludges. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various board cells in order to reduce the claimed sludge costs of average 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore totally reduced.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on boardelle in the process. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the pronunciation. "Some were correctly responded."
The judgments were based on commercial and bondage inclusion of foreigners, human trafficking, penalty and severe compulsory prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Sustainable Party with the Airhansa Group has again threatened the Ufo Consultant Federation with Streiks.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "notify on 14 October the work fight measures in the LH Group", Ufo-Tarif President Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct tariff negotiations with the Ufo. It also concerns whether the trade union has legally cancelled tariff contracts at the Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo now looks strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Working Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the tariff contracts were not cancelled. The Court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and verified the inquiry of the case. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely different, I think it is unlikely," said the Ufo Board of Flor.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted a request to the Bundesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt in order to legally verify the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not set up a representative board for months and is thus not able to complete its role as a collective partner.
In the past, a strong leadership dispute in the Spartengewerkschaft, in whose course many members of the Board and of the Advisory Board have come back, including the long-term Head of Ministership Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had exposed a already started urabial vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July, because of the doubts of its leadership.
Easy entrance: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia was not just known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and domestic visitors would be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to tourists. Visums are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with members in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch conservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own opinion, Riad wants to reduce its dependency on oil trade.
In the mid-September, several of the most important oil plants in the eastern Saudi Arabia had been hit by several rockets and drenes: the largest oil raffinadery of the country in Abkaik and the oil field Churais. In the followers, national oil production broke dramatically in, the oil prices were high. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are sitting in preparations for wedding festival
Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepared for her wedding. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram stories several party photos on which she was seen in the white wedding look. Reality-star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a young family party in Los Angeles according to the People-Magazin.
Justin posted several buntes, among other things printed with bananas on Instagram, and asked his attendants: "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding." Media reports suggest that the Promi-Par wants to marry church in the coming weekend.
The beebers had given the Ja-Wort in a New York state hall a year ago. A larger feast hadn't existed at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two of them had found a common level: "If you do not want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead at aircraft crash in Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police shared. In the dead, it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Since Thursday night, the authorities had searched for the machine after the crew had delivered a emergency signal by GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The accident cause has still to be determined. The crash location is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
Besides harmful, the World Natural Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are no other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 already stands at the highest level of danger and thus pre-extinence.
The IUCN divides dangerous species into six categories: "potentially endangered" through "hazard", "hazardous", " threatened from extinction" and "extinct" to "extinct" to "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than threatened.
Eberic and Wild Rose Castania threatened
In Germany, Eberschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the populations are as small as well or by transforming or weakening their living spaces."
It also looks bad for the wild usual roscastania. They have been considered to be "hazarded" since 2017, two of the IUCN scales. The largest threat is the Balkan minor moth next to a swamp. It has been spreading from south-eastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosscastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10 000 copies. Not taken into account this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and only.
Drugs and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for weighing animals, strains and moose. More than one fifth of the weighing animals and mooses and almost half of all types of smoking are threatened, so the IUCN. The most important is the destruction of the wilderness, the destruction of species, the agricultural practices and the climate change. Weights like snakes played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbreak of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the European Office. "We have to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injury reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. Dead were not reported. Thousands of people had to leave their houses, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish vice-president Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the spring there were almost 200 descendants. The earthquake of the starch 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and kicked panic in the millions of mettropoles.
Now the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay. Over the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for bidding, Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake threatened. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate.
One of the most difficult creatures was one of the strengths 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The Epicenter was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of the strength of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the mid-term show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will launch the half-time show of the next American football fanals Super Bowl. This gave the singers announced at Twitter. "Store will not be," wrote Shakira to a picture of themselves and Lopez. She was cruelly excited to stand on the super-Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she dreamed of getting on Super Bowl - then she saw Diana Ross flying in the sky at the half-time show.

Fighting against decreasing appreciation numbers
The Super Bowl is the peak of the American football season. The game and the semi-time show belongs to the most viewed TV transfers in the United States. Even though you have last dropped the numbers of viewers: In this February the spectacular in the United States attracted the least viewers for over ten years. However, there were still almost a hundred million people in the average.
To the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been a rebellion in the past: In the dispute about the dealing with Quartalback Colin Kaepernick, topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B, the group of Maroon 5 wanted not to appear in the last February. The critics were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then the Quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, had in the playtime of 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Hymne from protest against police violence and racism on the knees. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gestures. This ensured great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most African football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unified since March 2017 and has no NFL party anymore fostered. He forestrys the association to stop him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleids: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive to the pleasure of the traveller Thomas Cook, according to a press report. It threatens high depreciations on outstanding loans and loans. This also affects the credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (approximately 2 billion euros) on their books. This would have shown estimates of AlixPartner's consultative company.
The creditors of loans would have to buy depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors from 550 to 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciating are likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, said an expert on the sheet.
How much the losses of the believers will be at the end will be shown after the insolvency procedure has ended. A person close to this procedure did not spray too much hope. For example, the about 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad layers. Most money could be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Racket is supposed to have brought mutatisfactory murders to Italy
The Sea-Watch Capitän Carola Racket may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have certain information about it," said the speaker of the Refugee Organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben New Builder, the News Agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognised the three men in Italy. They are predicted to have raped, tortured and killed in Libya. The disgusting actors were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they had left on their ships. "There are no passion."
Carola Racket had brought illegal migrants into the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and hit a ship of the Italian Financial Police. On the day, the three suspects should have arrived there, and the captains are going to investigate for support for illegal immigration.
United States Warn Federal Government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equidae Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pai the "handelsblatt" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which obliges each company "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC-Chef, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "confidentiality declaration" by suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, such as technical solutions, reports the "handelsblatt" on behalf of its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology not only consists of the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of codes that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "also where, it would be possible to check each individual update in real time to detect security risks," continues the FCC-Chef.
The Chinese group Huawei provides close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are insensitive. The employee company, which claims to belonging to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said the "dealer sheet".
The United States has discovered that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for conversations in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in North France burnt: Schools closed
At night residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall lights the sky over a northern French chemistry factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the northern French city Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's cracks remain closed in the region.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not be opened carefully on Friday, the competent prefecture was informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not suspend the smoke. Injury did not exist. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and set the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. It is still the risk that after the deletion of smell, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 fire officers and 90 cops and gendarmen were in use at the fireplace.
From the chemical factory, a gigantic black smoke pillar had risen. French media reported gigantic flames and explosions in the Lubrizol company's factory, which produces additional oils. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city centre.
The factory in Normandie belongs to the authorities in the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, said to the transmitter BFMTV, there was no "high toxicity" found in samples at first. However, contamination of the nearby Sys could not be excluded. In the river, dampers were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire was broken out early morning at 02.40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause was first unclear. Rouen is a regional metropole and is located on its side between Paris and the port town of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, called on Germany to increase investments to encourage economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest, and now, the better the earlier, the better," Le Maire said on Thursday night in the idea of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the Eurozone is weakened, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation is worsening in order to make the necessary decisions."
Acting would have to be said, among other things, to those who had budget play rooms for more investment, Le Maire said with a view to Germany.
France does not have these gaming rooms, added the minister and referred to the high government debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilised" and "senked", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to take more public investments in order to experience the European economy. In contrast, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to deal with his budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax simplifications of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government, among other things, responds to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to decrease to 2.2 per cent, as expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Does he still try to tricks?: Johnson wives question about Brexit technique
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the 'Chaptation Act' adopted by Parliament sharply.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another sludgehole.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds himself covered about whether he wants to carry out an unregular Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, what is to prevent this, Johnson said to journalists only that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a suspension of the expiry date, no agreement with the EU should be reached until mid-October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "Chapter Law", which is difficult to negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political Schikane" in order to cope with the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure stipulating the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he is seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is that with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Consultant Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political conflicts about the Brexit as "travel in the park" and proved to be confident that the desired EU exit is still in place: "We enjoy what we will win, we will get out (note Red.: from the EU) no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" campaign during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, now acts as a chief Stratege in the British government seat Downing Street. He is to put behind the compromise-free policy that led the Prime Minister into a discretionless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all standing before the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tasks) is deeply in the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrated guests were Ringo Starr, Stellla McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Fronts-Fronts-France Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event, McCartney at Instagram wrote: "#ThePolaroidDiaries are a refuge in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the fortune of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, the art story studied at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundred of these are now published in the Polaroid Diaries.
It is portraits, still life, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 90s. "It wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, there is one in the centre: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phones in the bathroom mantle with a bag on her head or wears a very normal life in the Moonboats. Surely, McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the lighting light on her farm in southern England or Scotland. Thus, Mary McCartney said BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had boasted out of old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned with McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the Poloraid camera begins the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the choice Click: You have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to always capture the right moment. "I just knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Esssay.
The light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles-Fans, but also an anekdotic is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have already worked as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the just newly established Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday, Turkey could not cancel oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Full Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey has problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn "for the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "in particular in this question and in many other questions continue our relations with Iran," said the Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran has a secretly pursued an atomic programme and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the invasion of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have worsen significantly.
U.S. Government wants to restrict the refugee intake
The U.S. Government wants to drastically restrict the inclusion of refugees. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained on Thursday, the annual limit of a new settlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at present.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that although the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens, the US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqers who have helped the U.S. Military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, to take up a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The 1980 program will elect refugees from UN-Lagers around the world and resettle in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current limit of 30,000 is a deep value. When the predecessor of the US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was nearly 85.000.
Assistance organisations reacted to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. U.S. would thus continue to harm their leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally -. The US government expects to have its own information for the next financial year of asylum. These figures are separate from the new residence programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a tip"
U.S. President Donald Trump has advertised advertisers in the Whistleblower shop of the spionage. Anyone who wants to admit to the informant who has prompted him power abuse, "come close to a peak," said Trump according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several US media in conjunction.
Thus, Trump spoke to employees of the U.S. UN mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleplower about controversial transactions in the White House, he answered: "It's coming close to a peak." Then he added: "Do you know what we've done in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spion and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little different than we do now."
The observers reviewed the last remarks on a possible response to the death penalty. The Democrats exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and formed him intimidation of witnesses. In addition, there was an attempt to prevent a congress examination of a possible office proceedings against him, the chairmen of the Committees for Foreign, Secret Services and Supervisory in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower is assured to the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office in order to ask for an interference with another country in the US election 2020. Concrete is one of his controversial phoneat with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump put him close to initiating investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contradicts any mistake.
It is still unclear who are both the Whistleblower himself and its informants. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be analyzed by the CIA Secret Service.
Refugee boat census: Babies and grandchildren drink in Egäis
Once again, people try to get over the Egeic Sea from Turkey to Greece, where they often know much too small boats. During the fall of a sleeve boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died during the decline of a sleeve boat. Among the death victims, a baby and four more children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the occupation of a prevailing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broke up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of Chios island. Inousses is located between Chios and Turkish Festival.
The countries from which the migrants come are not known yet. At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Egea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee aid (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who Break Concert
A U.S. Concert of the Rockband The Who found an odd end because of an immorality of Leadsänger Roger Daltrey. At the midst of the arrival on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it goes."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apologizing and supplemented, Daltrey could "not really speak." The audience promised Townsend to come on his expenses at a reconcert of reconciliation. However, a date is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sundays in Denver, The Who said that they were to be recovered at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band was formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly adjusted rental: WeWork lets real estate markets go
In New York, WeWork has risen as the biggest hire.
Within few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driven force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world, but now the company is in the crisis. Renters need to be afraid of billions of revenue.
WeWork's office rental crisis threatens to disturb the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had dismissed Adam Neumann's founder a few days ago, suspended the planned exchange course and started with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private venue for the leaders to gain financial play room for the next weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. This has, among other things, been the largest lease of office spaces suddenly from the market in New York and London.
WeWork rents large office spaces on the long term and rents them short-termly in part small units to members. This can be individual free professionals, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork is currently burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company took a loss of $1.6 billion, in turn of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs should have risen as an estimated $2.5 billion. In order to limit the loss, the new company management will now have taken the emergency brake and the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has concluded lease contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, which result in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the whole real estate market.
According to the calculations of the Economy Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months almost 300.000 square meters of office surface. Only WeWork's new contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly marketed areas in this time. Without the WeWork's expansion, the office performance in the U.S. Metropoline would have increased at that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork is currently operating several dozen office stations in the best position.
Also in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be evident without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork’s main renter, in a last year by the Sparkassen-Fond Provider Deka purchased for almost 100 million euros office house in the centre of the financial metropole.
Many renters have converted their real estate to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make his business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to describe part of the hoped billions of revenues. Access to the WeWork reserves - without further buttons - they have not despite the long-term leasing contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by extra-funded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only has close limits.
Russia again arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal guard has again operated against North Korean fishermen. In the last days, there have been a total of 262 wild fishermen who had been illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic secret service FSB of the Agency Interfax reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them had been injured. This time there were no injured, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources, Russia’s coastal guards were discovered 30,000 ink fish. In addition, the information was captured according to three fishing boats and two motor boats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the re-controls, the Ria Nowosti agency reported that the coastal guard set more than 8.000 injuries in 2018.
The Russian fisheries authority had also not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans according to the complaints of domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in 2019.
The chief of the association of Russian fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrow-made synthetic networks that were banned in Russia. These would also bring small lives from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they need 200 years to be destroyed. Even the ships themselves do not describe the hygiene and technical rules.
In the past week, three members of the Russian coastal guard had been injured, according to Moscow's injury. An also wounded North Korean man died later on his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
United States prohibits the entry against Ex-President Castro
The United States has committed a ban on entrance against the former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The American Foreign Ministry justified that in a communication on Thursday with Castros participation in "great human rights injuries". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans were randomly arrested and captured more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Forces, the brother of the dead Revolutionary Leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disagreement of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the persistent crisis on Cuba and in Venezuela," twined American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made a ban on entrance against members of the Venezolan government and the military. For months in Venezuela, a bitter battle of power between the government and opposition has been undertaken. The United States has committed a number of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-approved Interim President Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean island is given oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of transmitted doctors. According to the U.S. and Venice Opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the oppression of government counterparts.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests hitherto, but thousands of people want to go to the road for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate struggle week, the movement of Fridays for Future plans again actions and announcements in thousands of countries worldwide. The beginning was supposed to be made because of the time shift New Zealand and Australia, before the protests over Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale business in Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather themselves.
Thunberg itself was good things. "The last Friday has struggled more than four million people for climate change. This Friday we do again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, it has been done 6383 actions in 170 countries.
Especially in Germany, the access of the last Friday was very large. A good third of all world demonstrators - about 1,4 million - had been involved in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time a list of the movements is planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as youths in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate.
At the age of 15 in August 2018, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in order to encourage the politicians of their country to take more advantage of climate protection. Thunberg has in a short time developed the Fridays-for-Future movement. The climate protests are mainly involved in students and students, but also in increasingly scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, in accordance with the Paris climate agreement, global heating must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic tower with a high sea racing hunt in New York. She had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was inspired to conscience to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home of Stockholm, she was used on Wednesday for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony, which is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker of the Ministry of Notice on Thursday in Moscow of the Tass Agency. The prohibition is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, then, has to count on a penalty of 3.000 rubels (EUR 42.46). If the cigarette should emboss a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the prohibition, the Ministry will fall like burning kerces. Also to grill meat shoots on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Slag against Cybercriminelle - Explorers lift servers
For the first time, in the fight against crimes in the Internet, German investigators have eliminated a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
Overall, 13 actors are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on the Mosel through the international-acting criminals in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach.
This informed the State lawyer General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects should have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had destroyed investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the state lawyer.
The first time such a host had been lifted in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with support of special units such as the GSG9 there have been searches in Germany and in the neighbouring country. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to inform more details.
New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests hitherto, but thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate struggle week, the movement of Fridays for Future plants again actions and announcements in thousands of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as jokes in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale business in Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protest - Who are Thunberg's behindmen?
Righteousness and courage are high deeds, including in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. Amazing more surprising that a 16-year-old girl keeps the powers of this time the mirror in front of the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to raise themselves for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can gain a collection of children and young people for himself. A child named Nikolaus from Cologne in 1212 has felt excursion to use for a fairer world. At that time he has also been able to win a group of young people for himself and overwhelmed the sea in order to get into the land of praised, like Greta Thunberg recently made himself on the trip to America with a sailboat.
However, there is a shade page in this regard? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has been widely sold thanks to the rampenlight daughter. Also old-beware followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed over the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably too much to thick. This is also not unjustified because the action came very well into the media worldwide and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Here are the spirits now divorced: Is it morally right to gain financial gains in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain individuals work together with stockmakers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately related to, a critical and reflected viewpoint is ever more important in a democraticly characterized society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may also seem to make it possible to criticize certain trendsetters' projects.
Comet discovered: Interstellar Guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers' suspects have confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - he is only the second of its type.
Garching/Washington - long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet by another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy of astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateurastronomie on the Krim
The assert body was discovered by an amateurastronomen called Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further post-observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. He is only the second of its type, which was looked at during the pass.
The great chance for astronomers is now to hurry out of the vicinity of insight into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of Canaries reports. The comet is clearly interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelway that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before approaching - and can be observed several months
However, before it is so far, the astronomers can see him closely. Because, in contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be studied from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov raises hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to 2 to 16 km diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our cometes - for as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sweep star is similar to us. This observation is close to the fact that cometes in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, supplemented de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are once again occupying the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid rushed over the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely deceived": Rachel Johnson disposed of over brother
About Boris Johnson it becomes lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister with clear words guitars the warrior language of the Prime Minister as "pleasant". It is not the brother she knows.
"Chaptulation", "Betrug", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to cultivate - at least verbally. At the time of questioning in the sub-house this Wednesday, it was on a massive reconciliation of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have reported: Thousand Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the sender Sky News to use words like capitulation, as if the opponents of a EU outlet should be "hanged, longed, fourd, poured and feded". She thinks that it is very disappointable. They do not recognise the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the elections to the EU parlament for the "Change UK" anti-Brexit party.
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a EU-friendly sub-house member, who had been murdered by a Neonazi in 2016 a few days before the exit referendum. Their concerns could best be honored by taking through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the sub-house. "It is very smackless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britian first', now criticized Johnson's sister. The acter was evident from the right-extrem camp that was strengthened by 'this kind of language'. For all those who grieved about them, it was very funny.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used like this," he twitted. The best way to honor them is if you passionately and determined to enter what you believe - regardless of what you think. But you never have to "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in the attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson younger brother Jo had set up his office as a state secretary and his mandate as a tory member. "I had been broken between loyalty to family and national interest in the past months - it is an unresolvable tension," explained Jo Johnson the step.
Johnson's language was also criticized in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 Bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy of dignity". In a common statement they explained: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should talk with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl, two women appear with Latino roots. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the next final of the US football-Liga NFL. This gave the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because this has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American football lia, which celebrates its 100th birthday in Miami in the next year, takes place on February 2, in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern top of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is purely-rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on the stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after their parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed great hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the "Hustlers" drama in the German cinema from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough she created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of semi-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. In this year, many are also being chosen as political gestures. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sport event and at the same time a giant advertising spectrum. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones looked for furrors there. In general, the NFL Finale looks far more than 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversials. The reason was the dispute about the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused from protest against police violence against blacks to raise itself when playing the National Hymne and, among other things, had been hard attacked by US president Donald Trump. By solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The Rock Group of Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
A actress and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether on the streets of Egypt again flowing blood have spent the last week both in abroad. One of them swept back on Friday at the airport of Kairo. President Abdelfatah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-General, who in 2013 lost the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely selected state head of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US president Donald Trump had praised Sisis against political Islam and no silver about human rights injuries at the Nil - in a week where Egypt's security forces were arrested hundreds of people because they had refused to protest against the presidents. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state sight. "The Egypts do not let themselves in the Ire."
The President of the other man who is currently determining the events on the streets, Mohamed Ali, of course stayed abroad, where he disappears the access of the security forces that would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter the Egyptian ground. The 45-year-old actress was only known as a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the toneous voice that conquers the political discourse in the Cafés, the living rooms and the testoubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to raise themselves against Sisi.
While the people hungry, swallowing the President in the luxury and putting up beautiful new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi is based on his rulership, is foregoing corruption and accomplishment. Because he made his second profession as a builder for 15 years with precisely these gentlemen businesses, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the precisely exploding numbers of clicks show.
After the last week since Sisis Griff after the power had demonstrated thousands of people against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called on a "million march" for this Friday. That really would be so many people on the streets, was unlikely. But there came to single small protests, for example in Giseh at Kairo and in the place of China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants had been procuring and demanded its departure. In these protests, the police also put in tear gas and rubber shoes. These videos were not able to verify independently. From security circuits, the police had finished the protest.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators were Banner last week with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the outfall roads. In Kairo several subway stations in the city of the Inner City were closed because of "conservation work", most roads around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa's site, on which the 2013 adherent Muslim Brother Murs disappeared, until the army took them under fire and up to 800 people killed, should prevent another measure from collecting misfriends: Sisis Futurespartei wanted to stop a great explanation for the President.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the tahrir place," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us fight with police officers." However, as a retractor, it is not to understand: "All Egypt is the tahrir place."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than it is purchased by the provider, there are different test possibilities.
Anyone who concludes a Internet contract does not need to trust the speed of the providers blindly. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in case of disturbances.
Finally, the pre-paid transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various test possibilities. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"The tests of the providers are, however, carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of the offer and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Consumer Centre of Bayern recalls on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the supplier a reasonable time period of normally 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work after multiple calls, customers can cancel and may also require compensation for damage. However, if the success remains, only help the complaint.
First ranking Republican for investigation
As the first rankhoer Republican, Vermont's governor has spoken for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is derived from here, it is determined by the facts that are detected," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the elimination of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observes Biden "since years".
Republicans have so far retained with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have proved unpleasant for this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as the relief of environmental legislation and the sharpness of immigration rules.
Spider Man remains in the MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore not be part of the "Avengers"-Universum. It was quite unclear how the films should continue around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report corresponds to several US media. Thus, the film starts in the United States: the film is to be started from 16 July 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige: "I am glad that Spidey's way is being carried on in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel studios are very happy that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superheld with the ability to play in various universities, since Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Probably Sony Marvel should have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of coming Spider Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finals
After nine stakes, the series of "Suits" in the United States is now reached at the large final. In the last sequence there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were charmingly customized tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series final.
One step forward: Duke Meghan did not return for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some backs showed the most imaginable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and lucky wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his declined penalty.

Eagäis: Baby and four more children drink at boatsungluk
During a refugee boat in the Egeais, a baby and four other children are drunk. Overall, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastal guards told on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell close to the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish Festival. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transmit to the Greek islands in the east of the Egea. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee aid (UNHCR) 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that they should visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "informe Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday, and then he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help manage.
On Friday, a speaker of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofers with the EU Iron Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Innen Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusual migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish Deal still work?
The rising figures last made doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which ensures that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands. In contrast, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deceased Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only due to the lack of staff on the Greek side. On Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29 400 people are suffering. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people are currently 5200 migrates.
It has never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Flight Pact in March 2016, the state round broadcasting reported.

Green politician must be responsible for punishment photopanne
The Chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the electoral struggle - was manipulated for this reason of the bechers?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Kanada - It has been quite a long time unnoticed - and eventually noted. The recyclable coffee beaker with metal throat, Elizabeth May, the Chief of the Canadian Greens, has never kept in the hand. On the website of the party she was seen on a photo with this becher, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also been distributed to the media - and there was a cute (Pap) becher as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chief must be responsible for photopanne
The National Post then rejected May’s manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible in the topic "Employment Protection" and that in the middle of a championship to the underhouse valley, where it also has Trudeau increasingly difficult for a coupling scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and took the discussion on Fake News. A user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen in order to hide their entrance cup."
May showed shocked and deepened on her blog to know nothing about this action. To underline it, she posted the original to that: in conversation with citizens, a becher in her hand. However, she put it right, be from Bambus. She always had it. A speaker of the party said that it was only about to put the party logo in the image, and not to divert something. From the photo it is only a cut on the site.
May writes that it hurts her employee who did this. "I don't want to mention him as stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked her over engaged team: "If they want to do a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German greens are also ratted for their use of one-way plastics or for flights in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photographed. Thus, the Chief of the Bayerian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at holiday ice with plastic apple, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It appears that Jaqueline Ng was secured by the mail by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for the check-in, she couldn't be on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get upgrading for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-explained influenza has asked the Airline Cathay Pacific actively for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65.000 users. On May 30, it fled back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
At the departure, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they showed an email in which their Cathay Pacific claimed to have upgraded. The writing would have received the influenza from an airline marketing employee. The Airline, however, accused Jaqueline of faking the mail.
On the back flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-term flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at the JFK airport were skeptic: they were climbing at the central. And actually, the employee from which the mail claimed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and had a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1400 (EUR 1.280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company who represented consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also requested the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains locked for future flights. The conditions of the Airline also say that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns a lawyer.
Oil prices according to the report on arms restraint in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Sorts Brent 61.83 US dollars - approximately 1.4 percent less than in the previous day. The price for a barrel of the US variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
Explorer for the course was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a gun stop in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have approved a gun stop in four areas.
A Drohnen attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had led to five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The hosti rebels in the Mediterranean Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, are responsible for Iran. A weapons resilience would eliminate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually concluded, you can concentrate on growth and demand, Ole Hansen, head of the Raw Material Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of the News Agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices will continue its decline in the last days. A barrel WTI oil had still cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost $65.
Finally, Bloomberg, in calling on Insider, had reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack at mid-September was faster than expected. Thus, the production volume reached a volume of eight million barrel per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Lastly, there were several press releases on insiders, reports from rapid progress made by the State Oil Group Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a carriage and avoid negative striking lines.
At the same time, some relaxation was shown in the conflict between Iran and western countries: the British oil tank "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the detection by Iran and the recent release issued on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship was further in front of anchor, Reedereichef Erik Hånell shared the Swedish broadcast on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced to move the defense and soldiers to the Iranian arch enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily raised oil prices in the past weeks.
Pronunciation against tromps sharply
In the affairs of possible power abuse by US president Donald Trump, confusions have become prosecuted against the White House. Several leaders of the government had intensely attempted to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a violent telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This explained an anonymous advertiser. The speaker of the representative house, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, was explicitly proclaimed to the White House "Contamination". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has doubted that there will soon be a third summit of powermaker Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The mind and the success prospects of such a meeting were questioned for lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said the top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the Agency KCNA.
The United States had not yet done anything for implementing the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the Consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He criticized also intensified US penalties and the joint military maneuver of the United States and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "modern" decision Trumps to bring it back to a closer approach.
Trump had said on Monday he wanted to know what was supposed to bring a third summit with Kim before he prepared to explain it. The negotiations on a dismantling of the North Korean Atomic and Rakete Programme have been held in Hanoi since the failure of the second Summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June then both met in the enmilitarised zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to relive the discussions until now, but without great success.

Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British Pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest, the pound loses value to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the Pound Sterling. The British currency approved by up to $0.4 per cent on Friday to $1.2269.
The sales triggers were statements of the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest in the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be rejected, as the insurance would affect the British economy at an awkward time. This statement is surprising, as Saunders was a warrant of a restrictive monetary policy, Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy through the Brexit Hickhack without direct signaling a reduction of interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will, if necessary, lead his country without a divorce agreement from the EU on 31 October.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister has received a high risk, but it could pay for him, says trade sheet editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, a former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletics World Association.
New details of the Doping Scandal in Russia are to be seen to the intake of the light-athletic WM - and they destroy the few of the credibility that the Russian sports had recovered at the beginning of the year and also only as a follow-up. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the demanded samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it came out: they were fake.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee reads after an individual examination in the summer games in 2016 in Rio about 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, in the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. Also, in the world cups in the various sports, they were allowed to be there, even the Fusssball WM with the host in Russia.
Missing positive findings
In September the Wada resumed the Rusada band, but called for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the confusion of doping cases during the state doping. They should help to penalise athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtathletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada had received from a Whistleblower and the ones they received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings lacked in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light-Athletics Association holds as the only organization at the Bann of Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada Manipulations had already put in the room and asked Russia to answer the prosecutions within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-locking of Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympic Games in 2020 in Tokyo.
