Tom was swimming in the pool.

We can use it.
I'm gonna save it.
He's unmarried.
How time did you go and leave yesterday?
Let him wait a bit.

How are you?
I'm just kidding you.
It's funny.
Are you unhappy, Tom?
Mostly, I agree with you.
Tom discussed the problem with Mary.
Are you staying at home?
Give me another spike.
You can be sure.
You have to move now.
She was foolish.

They're high school students.
One of your lies.
I've got a lot of time, so can I sleep for a while?
He's always crying when he's drunk.
Can you explain what this is?
Look at me in my eyes, or it doesn't mean anything.
Don't forget that there are exceptions.
