DFB-Chef Grindel does not see a basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently does not see a basis for returning from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he seemed to have felt something like it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Photos" magazine.
Despite the now monthly debate on Özil's photos with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed to some time that this would be the way," said Grindel.
In July, the 29-year-old had declared his withdrawal from the DFB team and also justified it that he did not defend him against racist oppositions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism to Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if you leave a team or change an association that you talk to his coach and I find it hurt that this conversation has not yet happened.

Under tears, the actress cares how shocked she is - and she keeps the wing.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" updating takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still there," said Head of Development Peter Mertens to the Branchenblatt "Automobile Week".
The arrested and admitted Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the Task Force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/drive combinations are expected to be checked," he said then.
Mertens now said, "At the beginning of July we reached an important step target in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel Candal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "decisive organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had made a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wanted to continue to discuss this Tuesday.

Grindel strives to re-elective - Lahm should go to the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel will, despite the criticism of his person after the WM out and the Özil deal in the next year, again be able to serve as a DFB president.
"I'm doing my work and trying to make her as good as it goes," said Grindel as a guest in the early Sunday morning in the "Actual Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again to choose, I will do that.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
According to its own words, the Chairman of the Confederation would find it "significant" if he did not after the grant for the football EM in 2024 "will be able to cooperate with the future project".
Grindel has been head of association as a successor of Wolfgang Niersbach crashed over the summer march shop since April 2016.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Federal Day on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Chef organizer Philipp Lahm is supposed to cooperate in the DFB presidency according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he was also consulted in this role in the future in the Bureau and then, of course, invited to make his experience available in sports issues," said Grindel.
In speculations, whether lamb could become his successor as DFB-Chef, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President of the State, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player should be the future without migration background integration messages of the DFB.
Currently, this office of Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there's one without a migration background clearly involved in society and football and says, "the topic is important, then we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide for a better basis for our associations on site where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with his three-day visit with Kanzler Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Shortly there was panic, people ran through each other.
Seven viewers were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.

"You can also like to meet with me at any time in a elevator," said Flake now at the New York Concert about the crowd of viewers.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the Journalist's robbery
State speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the robbery of a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Reep Tayip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first series.
The T-Shirt, hadn't been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance of the expiry of the press conference.
The act of the journalist has caused a strong disruption, which is not acceptable.
He has made it possible for protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Cancer Office.
This is absolutely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are claimed spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the fetholah-gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed punish trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening decades of prison.
Foreign journalists are also not sure before the Turkish authorities: first in early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had ensured survival.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking he usually knows his fans: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look at: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actress was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturizing conversations at the theke of the Hamburg Harbour Kneipe "Shellfish posts".
Moderator Ina Müller joins with her guests on some beer, some wine or more high-percent drinks to unlock the mood and tongues.
Not a few promises also drink courage for the mandatory song deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actress Florian David Fitz is known from films like "man's hearts", "Terror - Your judgment" or "The coolest day".
The coiner did not get the excursion to the high north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is totally naked on it, the eyes only two small clothes.
The Bed-Selfie shows a totally exclaimed Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - knowledge that he now won: "Regel one: does NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black saw.
And syringe.
And the round of egg liquor, which ina sweeps at half three, also lets away.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old person.
His fans posted just a few tips to combat the defense.
They were sufficient of instant breasts, fish brethren or - probably at the most targetive - headache tablets.
Others just enjoyed the sight of the usual attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller survived the nightly surcharge, it is not yet known.
However, since she has moderated the TV-Space on the theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and Unrat
The entrance in the 36 kilometres long railroad in Treysa, which is hardly detectable and decorated.
Recipes against grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly seen.
Screw, cigarette chickens, waste and unrate, demoled waste and in the meantime demonstrated signs - so since the long run of the entrance with a seat group to the wheelway on the hate hill in Treysa.
A more than unfavourable view for the pre-viewed object Railway Road in the Red Ticket Land.
The topic is the subject of members of the ADFC location group of Schwalmstadt, but others are already longer, so the Wüstehagen Wheel Traffic Officer of the city Ulrich.
The problem had already been addressed in the Wheel Traffic Council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals were sufficient from the removal of the seat group to the regular leasing of waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entrance point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstehagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also put the topic into the local council.
Not only the waste drives riders and residents around - the seating group is regular meeting point on weekends for celebration.
It is not only common, the layers are also destroyed: phospoons shaken from the earth, waste demolized, shields crippled, seating furniture.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the spokesworthy drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the racing space at the wheelway in Treysa is a meeting point for shipping.
"With all the cycling route, there is clearly the focus on the hatching hill," confirms the cycling officer, who now also cares for the new cycling place in goathain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes fairly expensive."
Another idea is a video monitoring at the hill: "Perhaps this may make the threshold significantly higher to comprehend itself to commoning.
However, this would require that then a police stroke will pass over.
Basically, deserthagen wishes to develop the hate hill.
He must be more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the cycling route could be very satisfactory.
Tourist marketing is still possible.
Our cycling route is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard body, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Ashe Red Street in Treysa.
There is no excavation on the hate hills.
In the case of regular traffic, bicycle drivers may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for music contest was a success, creative and in one another.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city partoffensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyelids in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke said.
In fact, it was soon a family together with coffee and cake by the honourable officers of the Culture Station.
Seven formations arrived from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blacks.
This contest, so District Citizen Joachim Schmidt explained, was a new one.
We have not yet experienced that in other parts of the city.
What did the texts look connected to?
In the places, the Hiltruper Sea and the market allies were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig shortened the lounge in his beaten song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Culture Railway Station was also appreciated.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction pauses with short interviews with the artists or indications about their creation.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitars.
From Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - on a major event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
However, for the favourites of the jury there was something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with a sound technician shameman.
Other musicians can record a song: He with his Hiltrup battle, who especially impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lumerland rule": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers of guitars and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all, the children came back to the final - and even without electronic support sounded "rightly good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accuracy of the melody and recognise value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Western Falish School for Music, Andreas Klomfat from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Part Offensive.
The city's partoffensive had put the event into life because of their ten years of existence.
She appreciated the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams who are in front of each other.
For each page there is a screen of view, there are four cards with keywords, which you can - the old trick with the red slide - only when you have put it in.
Thus it is ensured that the opposite can not read anything by mistake.
For example, on the cards, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Cube.
Fourth party.
These are the terms that are going to apply to encryption.
For here are not the terms to be guessed, but codes.
Alternating a player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not supposed to guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "cubes", "fast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposite team does not, as possible, wins the party if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Willing" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to festival; of course, there would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he was watching the school and knowing the window storm there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you don't know the concepts of the opposite, they can be better coherent with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
So, as mysterious as possible, but not to turn off, the rescriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptical to "Decrypto" is the rule.
The participants probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The declaration video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first put off will be fascinated about how much feeling is in this insightful game.
In total, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as clear as predecessors and genre prrimus "codenames", which also sets an agent topic on a game less words but is much better to play in small groups.
And who's only about advice and not about victory points, who can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and troubles guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the Police Inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a pre-existing police strip, and then he also fell in the upper city in a kneip when he troubled other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the sent place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspection in the prison cell.
In the narrower state, he must then be criminally responsible for the use of constitutional infringements.
Operation Pressig was home to the shoe blocks
The railway operation in Pressig was the turnier in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer knocked on buffer, it was heard in the whole pressy," Georg Dinkel recalls, who archives the history of the place and the station.
No one did that.
There the brakes were silent, and the wagons were knocked.
That was just a pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkels Home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald, a place was so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilramp mountain line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its peak point in Steinbach at the forest.
To accomplish this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bayer Landday approved the construction of a railway station with 21 locomotives, teacher workshops, bicycle and rail maize.
"Heartpiece was the rotary disc, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirshaid, rail historian and 47 years of professional iron trainers.
From the station (BW) Pressig, which was subscribed to Bamberg in 1968, there were also lots for the sideways Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern part.
On 15 July 1950, the "volksblatt" reported about 160 men's staff; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were ordered in the month.
In 1982, parts of the operation were cancelled, 1991 of the rest.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that you have not seen a better use of the location, including in puncto freight transport".
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Railway Directorate Nürnberg celebrated a pompous stationary festival in Pressig at the anniversary "50 years Electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic viewers here," George Dinkel recalls.
Just a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the ranking station Pressig was a history.
"The Rangers and Hemmschohlegers did the most difficult work in train traffic," says Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the conversion of the hierarchie of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are found here in the inflicted Plus article.
Kerber with entrance success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siemund have reached the second round at the Tennis Turnier in Beijing, as before Julia Görges.

The swimming pool now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach in the weekend in the series "Kunst and Genuss".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when in the terrain of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the special Vernissage "Windplay Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round around the Walberla" in the series "Art and Enjoy".
In the 15th year, he opened her pants.
A great visitor voucher showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 Copies of 20 artists are now visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He's been there for the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who likewise named himself as a main organizer and artist.
Something surprising but a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and designed flyers.
In this year there is also a 70-cent subletter mark, available at each art station, at the time of art & pleasure.
There can also be purchased for eight euros by Volker Hahn.
Hahn was pleased with the high claim of the special exhibition.
For the musical circumstance, Max Marcus Stadler was able to be won from Nürnberg.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windplay performance" formally challenges the artistic fantasy and ultimately expresss it.
It is artworks made of metal or ceramics, often supplied with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence, the visitor on the right side of the "gloss tree" is expected by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a wooden stomach, colourfully illuminated, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 cuffs and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun blitting through the bushwork in the background, the object works marvelously and loads to stay.
Barbara Waschneck, which prefers to three-dimensional letters, comes from Eckental to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
At half a distance, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has issued her work "The Wind the Heaven Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his bunte fantasy image of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay performance" to squeeze through the multi-sided art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singer celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtens also made their humility air.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out that after the resolution of the church chors "Cäcilia" there should be no sacred life in the city.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the tinbush, they raised the MGV 68 albachts from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of the encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Even for the anniversary, they had revived the founding festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was only a break.
At the time of the 50th year, the traditional festival was back.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Trumship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly talks about that the series could have had a co-debt on her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chiefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Trumship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went from board forever.
The series she made to star could be responsible for her failure to marry Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a bag alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues saw me at the height of the eye," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First, she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "Trumship".
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it is possible that her dawn man could have been very jealous, but "as many men also scared his conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he wanted to know my fears not to know my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've made myself," as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me a emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freak and courageously on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Hartner, Keller said once again yes, "because I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
On the day before the total grief, I was crying in the garderobe and wanted to say everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why didn't the men never work with them?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller then imagined love "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I'm too naive to love."
The nightbreaker, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZZ resort Zurich, has watched the ZFF opening party this time.
Our folder is not a moth, but a little lightweight.
And the grey glazing, in which a green carpet is dunked on the sixth place, blows it over fee.
But it is held film festival, there wants more or less famous to sunn in the light light.
Thus, on this late Thursday night, he darles over the place to facilitate himself shortly in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase".
The public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates their premieres at the festival, calls for this: The need institution in the sharer of a new pavilion has a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambient.
But this evening it stinks in the Lord Oase for some reason to heaven.
So get out of here, go to the other street side: Invited guests who have just spoken in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the festival start each year with a party in the three-sized shopping house.
This name fits perfectly to this film festival: From the whole earthball, the works showed are known.
What do you do not have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into an advertisement for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bulb around the feelings that have put a good fee to him, and two bully doorsticks actually win in it generously.
Inside, the invited ones are pressed to dance far after midnight to live music or they can be presented by DJ rhythms to whom they cry to each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite hips.
In the delicate dining shop in the Souterrain, Eastern waits for swinging mouths, next to the inequally shaking Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate brown sprouts.
And the hammer is: All the sales rules full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The trailer studys the shield at the rolling staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the rolling stairs."
If this is two separate instructions, he's been in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional design, and it certainly has already saved life.
In the household goods department in the upper floor, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing for proclaimed brand for years, isn't here in the evening either.
But then, between local prominencies, cash tables and kitchen articles, a face forward that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
There's probably not his main dealer.
And really: Likewise, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a chocolate, walks through the crowd.
He's not acquainted, not engaged, one shot at most stolen.
Just for this withdrawal, like misunderstanding as a pleasant, international stars love this film festival.

And then?

LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end, while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, also stood well against seven men and throwd on the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.

Surveys: 46 percent wishes Merkel not to be a cancer until 2021

Excursion at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi go to Tinder 2.0?
Who says, in times of tinders there are no romantic records - who should talk about punishment meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fast Food Dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is a signatorial place for the great love almost an anachronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pure meat, boxershort-snaps on the furnace table or the favorite podding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than just a sweep to the right.
The App Tinder is in the call to be less a contact- but rather a slightly busy.
We have watched the test: How do women react, in the first message you are not talking about the hot Brei for a long time?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood lovestory positions will then have it when the love luck predicts an out-the-eye-missed and-refounded plot.
If the guy also reports to his worshipers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi film that she will also find her dreamman, with which she has been talking shortly over the "30 percent reduced bio-puten meat".
For the belief in the magic of analoguous learning, she deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood in any case.

Football: Districtliga: Researcher's appearance of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this young season, then Alois Fetsch went to court with his hardness.
He gave himself, the coach of the football district of VfL Wolbeck, first resigned (inside) to focus on the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it's running around the firehoveway again.
Taufrischer Belege is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Old Rhine, during the last playtime only thin tons over the rise.
Yes, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.
"We've made the rooms close and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," praised Fetsch his boys and searched for each individual for the party to say simply "Thanks" for so much counterweer against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - it went out of the 4-4-2 nearly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), the exchanged Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost this would have happened when the SCA in minute 41 was two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his department.
After the break, VfL frequently took over full control.
Thewes from 18 metres failed hardly.
Schroer also came late at a Thewes input after 58 minutes.
With the exchange of Miles Geske missed a fresh cell cure again on the left side.
When Old Rheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters before the guesthouse an indirect free-run for the placelords.
The foul came to himself and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right slope struck down to the left from the sight of the protector - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes, they should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck fled unfortunately to the hand in the 80th minute the leather in the criminal room.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before in the 87th minute of twelve meters, the winner had on the pocket.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business
This was only 8 per cent of the boards on the date of 1 September, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented on this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will move over to them," said foundation manager Wiebke anchors.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male leaders - with few exceptions - are no longer thoughtable.
The remnant makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented compared.
It's another company culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is only due to positive impulses in the enterprises of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
Although, according to allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
However, in the previous year, the value remained 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - over the last few years of pre-residents - the proportion of women was stangled.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consequent women in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to accept self-debtedness to increase the proportion of "null percent" until now.
Another picture can be found in the supervisors' boards: By 1 September there was the proportion of women at 30,5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"When you recruited as many women each year for the boards, a percentage of 40 percent would have been reached in 2023," says the report.

In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger has been deadly hurt.
When note doctors are called, they should help - most of all, save human life.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of a physician with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been injured deadly.
The taxi driver, the physician and their drivers were severely hurt as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the physician car had overturned a red amp on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collapsed on a crossing with the taxi that drove at green.
After the collision, the medical car swallowed against an ambush and a tree.
He recorded the passenger who died at the accident site.
Doctors and taxi drivers are severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi drivers and the driver of the emergency physician were hardly incorporated in their vehicles and had to be released from the use forces.
The well-injured 29-year-old physician was able to liberate himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another occupied physician tried this, however, without success.
The three swords were brought to hospitals.
The police determine in close agreement with the Bonn State Prosecutor who is guilty of the accident.
Manchester United is losing again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is still supposed to be spoken.
Significantly, the scene was in the 74th minute, in which the regenezed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford the Red Devils supposedly returned to the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's passport, all defendants of Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic reads all the time of the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously over long distances of insufficient performance.
On the other hand, the moth is currently at Uniteds City Rivale Manchester City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's large competitors Pep Guardiola arrived against Brighton & Hove Albion to a cautious 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem sterile for the home team first broke the defence of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero took care of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the formal tower guards, and thus also for the jump to the table top.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 downlay in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri struggled with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-out, the Belgian Eden has been the best man at the Londons.
The meeting of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the end phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his locker.
So after the reds started with a makeless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool now also crashed from the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs of Todtenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (gear Watford) also celebrated 2:0-winning.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka went through, however, were tolerated against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County until the 81th minute for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defense Craig Cathcart buxed an inscription of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, just two minutes later Mesut Özil took care of the decision with his third season meeting.
Arsenal moved along with Watford thanks to the fifth victory and is newly behind the big Rivalen Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to rise up Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves stayed in the fifth time in the League at the 2:0 against Southampton and provoked the 8th place.
VW Care Mark missing: Paris Auto Sale in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris automotive salon will take place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet all-time: The Diesel Candal and the ringing for driving bans and re-equipment are not supposed to release the German auto-concerns at the Branch Meeting in Paris.
In 2018, they show their news from the next week with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really play a major role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and replacement offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until that time, would still be an important topic at least behind the glossive scenarios of the trade fairs.
A large name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters involved, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstowns is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will only start in 2021.
The new 3rd is at the centre of Paris.
Over 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to autogroups, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors arrived.
At the heavy earthquakes and the following Tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first creature had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, enormous damage occurred.
After the feet, the Tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people at the beach were gathered to a party in the coastal city of Palu.
It is feared that the sacrifices are still significantly high.
The figures are only from Palu until now.
However, there are also many other communities - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers celebrate God’s service in Werdol
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a helper team the final service for the motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werhl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
In any case, the Final Divine Service for the Bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the sailing concerns of the PS-star two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle god service (MoGo) will always take place at the Nordhelle house.
The end of the season traditionally celebrates the bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to do anything other than usual worship.
From 10 o'clock the ballites had been run up before the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the Biker-Frühschope was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or with a deep curryworst.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also there.
The preaching was held during the Biker-Gottes Service of Prins Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer Songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical painting.
"Because the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetically-calm tone," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was probably also a novum in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Heavenhouse venue celebrates a great festival: After the apple the milk comes
Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pants.
The great interest also raised Georg Hartmann-Neemerg.
He had his apple press in the bag and demonstrated his amazing viewers step by step the process from the mature apple juice to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Nemerg leave the children the field, and let them fill the apples in the great trigger.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely scattered mass.
Not yet, many of the children could imagine how it should be a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this important work step at this late Friday afternoon.
In forms packed and wrapped by networks, Georg Hartmann-Neemerg stacked the a little like hacked apple pieces layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the older visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in feather" was similarly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only persecute the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built hipburg for themselves.
Activity of the fox tower Cambodia of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited some stations to short-term games.
The home association will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
Then, however, Gregor stressed Krützkamp, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargeldorf of the place of happening.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the subject: finally it will go around milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season pattern: "Customed situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga-Niederlage, Trainer André Widenreiter gathered his disappointed professional by Hannover 96 and spoke courageously to them.
However, many positives were not seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Frankfurt transport.
"It's a stupid situation, but you've got to get out of there as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler and threw, "It's naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further victorious Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) hit the connection, stands with two counters at the bottom and is in their current constitution a decline candidate.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first season's home victory of Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached the gates for the DFB pokal winner, which, after the successful general sample for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in his start-elfdebuild in almost every dangerous open action of the Hessen and never to be handled by Hannover's defense.
The storms long hit after the WM showed with its speed and enforcement capacity why it is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter, who began swingful.
One of Lucas Torró’s headballs (17.) on the gate network brought for the first time danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a prominent position in the last moment by the 96 warranty around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (Rücks).
The leadership for the houselords fell almost necessarily and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a defended corner in the courtyard, Haller extended by head to the gate where Ndicka only had to hold the foot.
It was the first Federal League meeting for the defendants coming in summer by the French Second League AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt went on before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think through and had no chance of 96-thorn Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover Coach reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new open forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous, but flamming ideas remained until shortly before the end when the connector still arrived.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a little hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, which only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest of the Frankfurter was against overrequired guests only still walking, even Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix space becomes a party miles
Through cool temperatures, crushing was a good atmosphere at the October festival in the inner city.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter created it before millions of publics at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two hits.
Gifts: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy-Creuz Festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy-Creuz-Circle with the final egg.
The Holy-Creuz-Circle houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and on which the legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound then flowed blood.
From this, a great wall trip developed to the shot of Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy-Creus Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar space stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, priest Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger priesthood, God’s service was badly visited.
After God’s service, the procession took place to the Holy-Creuz-Circle, and with the conclusion, the church part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years the Catholic church chor then invites to the worldly part of the festival into the Catholic priesthood.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty foods as well as a large selection of cakes and weather, farmhouses.
In the afternoon, the priests offered leaders around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid winners informing the visitors on the order of the parishes about the damage to fassade, roof, sand stone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to move to the next year.
After the noise has been set for a while, the damage could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were prepared more concretely.
It is sure that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago has grown larger, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the inertia with noise.
The soccers are finished, before the winter, the natural stone works are to be started and the hope is to be able to complete half of these work this year.
Invitation: New home in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße, "a very special house" will now be handed over to his destination - there were agreements between all attendants at the deadline of the deadline.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, who have already lived in the living home of Danube Iller, have been in charge of the special architecture of the new building.
Wider gangs, halls and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former official building of the U.S. Army was placed on the test stand for the inhabitants with mobile heads: "The house had come in the years and no longer time in the equipment," said Bader backwards.
In 2016, the Baggers pressed to cut off the house.
The reconstruction should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well in it, according to the architect.
Life help Donau-Iller opens a new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in reconstruction.
The free state amounted to EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
The construction works have remained in the planned framework, according to architect Bader - timely and financially.
He also thanked the Leader of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and simultaneously fire-safe construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that the inhabitants had experienced freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is focused on the specific needs of his inhabitants, which need help to be mobile."
It would have been well combined with living and functionality, said Kreutmayer.
And further, "The ground in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation."
Totally, the new home in the Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three housing groups.
Stolz is the life-help business leader Heinz on the 11 full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Schweig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the vice-president of the SPD-Bundespräsident Manuela Schweig appealed to all countrymen not to find themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We should not be satisfied with these differences," said the President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, "day level on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germany worked longer in the meantime than the people in Western Germany, but at 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that nearly 30 years after the German Unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this pink dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunt dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax the relationships with Seoul, Pjøngjang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunt dogs.
As Moon’s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about one year old reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore happened the border town Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed in order to facilitate the "advantage" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white rock, spice ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Culture Facility of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced the north at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean employee Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September.
Both countries agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games in 2020 and to apply together for the exhibition of Olympic Games in 2032.
During the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
At the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this Memorial year for nearly ten months, many new books have appeared, which mostly answer this question in the backwards of the last hundred years.
On the other hand, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, places it in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - then the unofficial motto is for the work week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Nearly a interview, hardly a speech, in which the offices and their ministers from CDU, SPD, and also from the CSU have not made the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other occupied citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and occupational work, but what is it?
If the Federal Government is now to resign to the government - it is the government - it should not be stopped now with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blades of the past weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government couples gather to the Coalition Committee.
Kanzler Angela Merkel wants to regularly call this round in order to eliminate conflicts early; a doctrine from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda with diesel after-supply and the expert immigration law.
CSU Traffic Minister Schuuer wants to make the auto-concerns with exchange premiums look out to get out of the way, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for the technical re-equipment of older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has been closer during the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned expert immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum candidates who work or make training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trace change" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal to the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Conflict is good.
Without dispute, a society of so many, sometimes contradictory interests does not come forward.
In order to be constructive, disputes must not be rebuilded for partial reasons on the question of His or nonsense.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to fight, but always have the life-effectiveness of people in mind.
What is possible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the trace exchange question can be pragmatically clarified - and thus recovered confidence.
Especially this is why the people's parties now have to fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour charge against the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more precisely.
"Really day and night" had worked with her legists in reform of social insurance, reported an overwhelming Minister of Social Affairs at the presentation of themselves two weeks ago.
At the list-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ)'s statement is admired - she now brings the matter into Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister just wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her teams and no infringements against existing service law before running cameras".
Yet, she now has questions to be able to free Har things from every suspect.
Police takes a road in search of women's body
Marx Green - Longe didn't want to say it.
Now there's a confirmation.
During the early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The distance is still locked in the Marx green area until Monday.
In the past, the investigators had used a archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of ancient human knees, together with his leader, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters in multiple use.
In addition, together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bayerian monumental protection authority, a soil anamality was discovered in the area of the said roadpiece.
For more than one year, State lawyer and criminal police court have been dealing with the missed case.
Marxgreen was once again locked a wheelway and studied with sonar devices because the investigators suspect that this could have been worsened during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: crane walls in Barcelona before Catalony Anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first year.
But already before it comes to Krawallen.
Separatists have not forgotten the police action from the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independent Referendum of 1 October 2017, it has come to conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3000 officials of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the illegal referendum in the election rooms.
In attempting to prevent citizens from voting, it also came to violence at that time.
The Catalan police had created a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the about 6000 separatists, however, would have tried by violence to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, made color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others had been easily injured, it was called on the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be the first year.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to distinguish the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid Catalonia in the autumn of 2017 had put under force.
Then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled into the exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also settled in abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra is on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Upperliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC goodssloh and RW Ahlen distinguish themselves without delay
Red-White Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at the FC goodssloh, it was only a 0:0 disagreement.
The final light and the third last they disappeared before 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadium as collected ratlessness.
The first half was reluctant of the entertainment factor.
Therefore, who would prefer to get a beer or a bratworst could do this without concern.
It was not the risk of missing a Torchance, because there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) gatehead of the whole batch branded Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibilities had the Ahleners, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space border to a parade.
The hosts were even harder.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing long - suffering.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed 18 metres tightly over the housing and after an hour, the goods lowers also appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented contour over Sinan Aygün "powered" Nick Flock (62.) with a but lazy shot in the arms of RWA Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) they followed a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interim Trainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not permit.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but the one brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut tried to stretch out the positive: "It likes me that we have played at zero," but unfortunately the zero has also stood forward.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as yet against wooden weighing and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer observed.
Offensive "located everything like this a little" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
I didn't at all feel that we could get a counter," said the fact.
However, as an audience, it was not the feeling that his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too necessarily necessary for that.
Rail fields Harvest Thanks Market: Happily there are enough creams
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Every Fritzler are happy from the table edition site for which these donations are intended.
The honourable officers assure: "These donations are also remaining in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky showed itself radiant blue, but the space was still empty, but that should still change during the day.
Because, "Hier it's so nice, so we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a ordinary prize of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer were short-term.
Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creams.
And the "replacement" did not take it to enter into musical conversation with the increasing visitors.
This was so good that some people were sung with later hours.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date this time in his schedule.
He rejoices over the many assets with their stones, including mainly associations.
"There shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the chores of men.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the towns and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives a bunting point - here's something.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire gun and brought into the winter quarter.
In many towns, we have been working for the physical welfare.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative in his decupier saw.
Furnier work, beer deck with racing fields motives and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three racing fields of Imker: "Rackfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Bush Schloets.
Last named one has another speciality with it.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, as good as the cake tasted.
The convenience is that the visitors then left to stay long until the evening hours, even without stage programs that weren't present at the autumn festival.
Smuggling with local policy message: No successful advertising for tax plants
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably hardly acquired a favourable way for the construction of a treasure facility.
In several places, it gives appropriate smuggling, says Jürgen Kohne from the city management on request of the WN.
At least one case, the police have been punished for injury.
In large letters, the three words "Scatepark for Lengerich" are among other things on the Gamp-Halle and the Old Councilhouse.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertisement sign on the stairway rise to the Gamp-Bistro.
Since the short message of the time seemed to have been left "only" with a dinner, it was easy to be removed.
"Something days later, then it stood there again, this time sworn," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note just gets this case by calling several large companies from Lengerich on the table.
If the tax plant is built, its realisation is also intended to be possible by sponsors.
It is already promised to explain Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the carved table.
For years local policy and administration have been focused on Skateanlage.
After the old one was degraded at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council expressed itself as a majority for the fire parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to be against a construction at this point.
The end of June followed a turning.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It is not a decision this year, so that it could be built with a positive vote in 2019.
In the case of air navigation, the airpass becomes worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European Air Traffic Chaos in summer, the German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then come to the storm," said the chief of the air navigation union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the air navigation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight losses is the long-known staff emergency in the European air navigation systems for which there is no rapid solution.
"The airlines and airports can accomplish fast improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unions.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained lots was empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for monitoring the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the city of Hanse, representatives of the Federal Federation, countries, air navigation, airlines and airports gather to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional working digestion and overtimes, this will not go without us," the Head of the GdF, who has many members at the federal German air navigation.
Maas relied on the EU Commission's targets for the lotsen miers.
Transport forecasts for the period of regulators running until 2019 have been much too low.
The costs and staff savings of national air navigation systems result from them are now fully inclined to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), in Brussels, to implement rules that "not further cut off the air".
At present, the EU rules would vote up to 2024 and there would be further sharpness to fear.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have seen in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high late cost of the airlines would reconsider.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air navigation (DFS) offers a "advanced training and future pact", Maas said.
The uptake of 120 lottery schools for the next five years was just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrapp Supervisory Board is voting for group numbers
The members of the Chyssenkrupp Supervisory Council voted unanimously for the plans for the reconstruction of the group.
Following the will of Chyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the sitting on Sunday, the Critical Group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and be listed at the stock exchange.
There should not be any additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in administration.

Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to them.
However, the final decision is to take a main meeting foreseen in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG should include, among other things, the 50% share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be combined with lifts and deliverys.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos by policemen and Catalan independence.
Two contemporary demonstrations of Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have experienced violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, on Saturday, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain were gathered, and about 6000 independence prosecutors demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried with a great command to keep the two protests away from each other.
However, according to the forces, independence prosecutors repeatedly tried to break the security locking.
They would have attacked the officials with color and thrown shots.
Rangeleien was also reported between the participants of the various protest traits.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told you there were six arrests.
Better wages and assessment of colleagues
The police wanted to honour the colleagues with their demonstration, who had been committed almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Residents of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the AFP News Agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drove us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearians who wanted to give his name only with Daniel rejected the condemnation.
"Of course, we want to support our companions who have only done their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there for our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more Echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the police insured.

Football: Juve Trainer praises by peak party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Storm has "played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) - win of the record champion against the SSC Neapel.
For the trainer, the expensive purchased Star was also without its own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactic mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three towers, Juve turned the game after the early remnant through the meeting of Threes Mertens (10. minute) and depended first on the worst persecutor.
The gatekeeper collected by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double package (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the preparing work for the meeting of Defense Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to postpone just before the gateline.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But, of course, Allgri wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record-tour protector.
"We have to get better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve tour shield is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to become more depressed.
Seven victories in seven games are the makelless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the seven years back has already six counts spring on naples.
The tables trained by the former Bayer Coach Carlo Ancelotti were not unanimous against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58.) was the top party decided.
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow root from the place.
"We have played well against a good naple," the Turin Coach commented.
It was also possible for Emre Can to feel there.
The German national player has passed through at Juve.
The professional coming from the FC Liverpool was in use with all seven Liga parties.
The central field player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which meant Allgri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the place at the 2:0 victory of the Turin and was locked for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West, with a special surgical appearance, gave attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" in the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water cost for pearls and question marks with the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name for the publication of his new album.
After all, you can only call him "Ye", the musician says.
"The beings known earlier as Canye West," he twittered to the dead singer Prince when he put his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a new one.
Already the tenth album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hole from his disappointment.
It was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was merely grippery, we have never put it before problems. As thin, the list of Hoetmar's deposit possibilities is read.
Grade times two torchances in 90 minutes, so it is rare to make games positive.
Football crystal A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackberg
Also the SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first Maik Krause used from a spice angle to the early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation of Krause he understood free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when first Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in the afternoon of Jan Blome in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became still dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) forgave all.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the gateline and saw it red - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stowed the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had been toughly criticized before, that was then different from in the past weeks," was the fazit of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circle A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he ranked in words.
"We have no access to the ones." With that he deliberately meant the wing songs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all other green whites that came up with collective openness.
However, he could laugh: "A horrible victory," he said, twinled frech and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was note the lighting that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Well-known, after a dual of two teams, one of whom, namely Albachten, plays the mastership and the other, Albersloh, fights to hold the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best seasonal performance with distance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, how we keep over the entire game time against one of the top people of the League, that was really phenomenal."
So bitterly it is that you need to drive home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts in the lead with his 12th season meeting (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he put on the left side musterable for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew it, but such a player can't be held to take out completely.
"That was already crazy what he made," Lewandowski unnecessarily recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the page change, his own eleven made the balance: McGill's left-hand sailing sails between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long torque (45.).
After the page change, it was McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went down and down.
It was a tricky, action-loaded game.
Newly shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite the surplus, Albersloh was no longer able to reconsider the last Concordia Triffer (80.).
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against sharks, that's what we need to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers approximately 80 meetings until mid next year.
That is why France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This was how Academy Director Udo Hahn, when he proudly said, "All federal presidents and Bundeskanzlers were already with us," that at the Academy in the Tutzing Castle, prominents appeared again and again, but was also an issue in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmaker Constantine Wecker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also said that he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" granted by the Academy in Tutzing personally in Tutzing, which also receives television moder Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is not sure!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "riskous and fatal route over the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting on Syria, "Barbarei without limit."
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war abuses every human idea."
From structural racism in society about the gap between arm and empire to radical change in work by digitisation, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting at 200.
The next birthday of Karl Marx, the more visitors of the direction of capitalism criticism, the others are rather a tendency "from left outside to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical National Church," said Study Director Dr. Ulrike Haendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Sexual Consciousness with Heart - Wolbeck - West False News

As a cabarettestin, toubers made the sex understanding, not only with humor and heart warmness for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) man and what else may be, but also with music.
The Mini Gitarre put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben Süverkrüp was sitting.
It is one of the male sparring partners, who sometimes come to the end of the sentence, to the second, a true pianist: So kingially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner, that some might have wanted a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely as it fits to the red thread of the evening.
There towers had brought a paradoxon into the game: the satisfaction of the man will come if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates selfbiges: What would have escaped from composing Mozarts, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door indefinitely?
So Süverkrüp in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death" and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a gamed dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers surrendered Karlheinz Kleintje, treasure chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the Duo next to the appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt one in Wolbeck.

The Ahlener girls had problems, especially with the third-party player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten hits alone.
"I was really satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We didn't get them in the hands," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But it was more angry about the many abandoned opportunities.
The concentration at the end left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran nearly until the end of a residue, lay to break with 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.).

About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-meister of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has accepted in the two rolls, but hasn't come into the game.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has put up with a high risk but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "It has converted the adoption to three-rolled.
We couldn't keep the pressure.
Food has been sucked, and we've been getting a little bit in,” said Munch continues.

Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciliable appearance.

The widespread exclusion of the German public has "powered many reservations".

In the meantime, this event has become a strong part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," he is pleased with the chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a galla in the Dr.-Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Garden and National Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a view of fruit in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding vaccine was set for the Circle Association for Gardening and Landpflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall on Saturday evening.
In 1893, he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was actually purely about the fruitage, about flowers and gardening at the time, no one thought of it.
"The fruit tree was a favorite kid of the Elites at that time, in the time of the exploration," explained Günter Dippold’s career in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should swallow remote roads, where schools have been built so-called industrial gardens.
The construction of the fruit is still the task of the 55 garden associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But with this the spectrum is far not exhausted.
A naturally close gardening, biological plant protection, village revelation and nutrition plays as much as the supply of knowledge, healthy diet and youth work.
The many of the tasks of a gardening association showed the members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Maulwwers" entertainable on the stage.
"Young work is urgently necessary especially in the digital age," said the Circle Chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The castania collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & Co. you can gather a lot of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the circuit association decides," added the Landrat Söllner and highlighted the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circuit association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, also circuit business leaders and expert advisers Friedhelm Haun did not doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture talk through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, the need for self-supply after war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was poured in.
In the end of the 1950s, however, the garden has turned into a cereal and living garden.
"The nature has stable, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nuts trees.
Therefore, for the garden building associations, it is incentive not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and vital.
It also belongs to welcome the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bayerian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, supplemented.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline of insects, that's what we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful festival that was celebrated by the Turmbres of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister held UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: They make both trade partners an ultraimatum for a agreement.
The Canadian Foreign Minister now grants absolute priority to the trade agreement - and moves her speech before the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure on ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has suspended its speech at the UN General Debat in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only speak on Monday before the full assembly of the United Nations, her speaker shared Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she focuses on the new negotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had explained that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States had 48 hours of time to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement that has already been concluded between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to reconcile the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been running over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they will now be brought to the conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement before 1 October to the US Senate.
In the event of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protest against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro has left the hospital at a knife attack.
The right-extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, after a report of the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country will take public action.
The politician was attacked at the beginning of September during a election event in southern Brazil on open streets.
In the meantime, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Not"), women's associations had been called to protest against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and virtuous statements mobile.
In the economic metropolis São Paulo, several thousand demonstrations were expected.
In the capital of Brazilia, the protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian worker party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He entered the place of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced for corruption for twelve years in prison and must therefore not be candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
Haddad was the former Mayor of the millions of the city of São Paulo in surveys far behind the right-extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been mixing with the political operation for a long time, newly presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a stamp election on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will come out of this non-successful - regardless of who he approaches.
Bolsonaro is known for his being against homosexual and black and glorifying military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks again and again with verbal disguises.
Another time he said that the followers of Lulas left working party should be shot.

After long sickness: Danish rock legs died
The Danish Rock Icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at 72 years of age after long disease, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
At the death bed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician has been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become familiar with the Gasolin band, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the resolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt at night" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lucke Rasmussen appreciated Larsen on Sunday in an explanation as "strait boys", who was "on all the other hand, but in all the hearts".
In addition, the Head of Government reminded that the Monarchy captain Larsen had occurred on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and ignition a concert loss with the strength of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" are placed such a rescription of the rocky live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Citizen's Shoe Factory: Hardrock pure from three with another band.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group picture.
No trace from lamp fever.
Afterwards, the Rock Protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in the association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudstark the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are viewed.
Already the Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontman and Gitarrist Dennis Hadrika knows to conceal with the latest, unknown pieces of their own feather and the next CD to appear.
In front of the stage, the band will be danced to the voiceful and pressureful interplay.
Although "admission" calls are not to be overwhelmed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
That Hardrock is not like Hardrock, demonstrating the guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and slaughtermaker Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes in classical rocks of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the desired, just too balladenous "Take Me Home" covers by switching melodic passions to the guitar lax rock reefs of the multi-layer songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tunish-Shucks has played a special degree of knowledge since its foundation in 2005.
Full of anxiety, the band presents her hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its appearances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unobeyable.
Songer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also puts in the interaction with the band on the only gecovert song of the evening, "Word Up" of Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
At the time, the guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an even more excited solo, which runs through the audience.
A certain volume is subject to such a hardrock concert, of course, to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing team at the three concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibel.
This is about at the press air hammer level, but it is still clearly below the exams of the "wack-fetitvals", pointing to the "The Ignition" on its website.
Ear deepening 120 decibels in dust drive volumes as used for the annual metal steel thickness in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not need to eat at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang type have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bone sauces and tinned a concert tape with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead in the case of a sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident has occurred.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailing plane is crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the Mülheim/Essen airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "West-Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailing plane was crashed at the fair parking lot at the airport.

The plane has been found at the time of accident at the flight.
The crash station is only located near a fixed terrace on the airport area.
But a October festival has taken place since this weekend.
The Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the border of the two towns of Ruhr und direkt auf dem Auffahrt zum Autobahn 52.

Trump provokes Kim: "And then we have loved ourselves"
That, despite nuclear crisis, the US president of North Korea has been well-sensitive to Kim, there is no secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the low age of 72, the married president of the US has known a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In all the public, Donald Trump made an unusual love statement to the North Korean mightor Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of adherents in the US Federal State of West Virginia, Trump almost already found tender words for the half-old splash of the ruler's dynasty of Pjöngang, although it proves to be quite tighter in the rings around North Korea's nuclear decoration.
"I was crushed, he was also, and between us it went away and here," said Trump.
And then we loved ourselves.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also carried political fruits: Trump refers to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip awareness.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - was not supposed to be any memorial, it seemed to be aware of the U.S. president.
In any case, he took the criticism that was expected in his appearance in a large sports hall of the city Wheeling straight away: "Donald Trump says they have loved."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little about this, explained Trump and then directed his finger to the crowd: "I've always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then, there wouldn't be ten thousand people out there in this fold filled arena, but we would have been just 200 people out there.
October festival attracts many guests to Bavloiler

Refugees saved from libysch prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have, using a mobile video, pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya and thus enabled their salvation.
The group had turned up in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under life danger and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors warned the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Within the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in attempting to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he brought himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his companions had been struggled by the wards almost to death, said Onyeka.
Generally, the prison conditions had been catastrophic: "They all hit us with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink out of the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary reception of refugees who are stranded in Libya.
About 2.700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their home this year by means of the programme, said the IOM speaker in the Western African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
But he has not heard of a phone phone call.
International organisations have long been criticizing the conditions in the libyan refugee camps as human insignificant.
The North African state, which is dominated too wide parts of milits, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a pitch into the ground floor or the front place.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigations.

Germaner was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in mid-franks, after having caught the car beyond all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon randomly near a weed and released the missing people since Tuesday night, the police shared on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was found in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without supply.
He claimed to look forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday by a ride with his land car over the local grasses and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man's remainance has remained unclear for days.
Advocates Legal State in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with the Turkish President Reep Tayip Erdogan urged the state of law in Turkey according to its own information.
The relationships of the two countries were currently "overestimated", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Kölner Airport.
This concerns mainly arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
For Erdogan, he has therefore made it clear that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened that legality is a very important condition for this.
Laschet, according to its own information, also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion should be respected.
After that, Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The discussion of Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a short-term airline building of the Federal Defence Ministry at the Kölner Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at the castle's wrath, but that the lockers had rejected from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan continued to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the construction work.
He said, "The Muslims that go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are their contact partners - not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea demands dismantling
While U.S. President Trump is not tired to stress the success of negotiations on the denuklearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more prone to the situation.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a contradictory of Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US government at the UN General Debatt to block the negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its remaining sanctions.
"The recent stop is therefore that the United States builds on forced measures that are fatal for trust training," Ri in New York said.
A dismantling system is not possible for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Unless any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first," the North Korean Chief Diplomat declared.
That penalties of North Korea could force the "Knee" to be "a wish room of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US site there were no "compliant reactions", the Minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and rocket program, the UN Security Council alone decided three times against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have in the past days in the United Nations demanded strict compliance with the penalties.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a approach.
For the first time in June, Trump had hit North Korea's magnifier Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States will attend a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pjøngang on discussions about the end of the North Korean nuclear programme.
HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White covers and flower decorations on the tables and a big buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanks to God’s service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with costlyness from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were prepared for the great day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power loss had excluded the huge, two-part refrigerator, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be shown, the guests were excited.
"Better it can't make a cooking," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido carbishops were served or the guests were allowed to serve on silk, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and youths have put on the legs," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while magic Stephan lambs with cards and other pieces of art made surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of the Table NRW
From frustration about criticism from its own series, the chief of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the country association.
Sartor had become known widely because the Essener Table had introduced a stop of recording for foreigners.
He had already returned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW tables, Sartor said the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The chief of the NRW Tafeln-Landesverband, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding of the decision of his long-term representative.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there people who didn't know exactly why the food tables do that."
But Sartor is still active for the food tables - "six days a week, there is no change in it," said Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You can't follow the approach, "without us, people in the city are hungry."
It is the responsibility of the State to ensure that people were not hungry.
The Essener was not part of a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet shirt to tell me," he said.
There's all these social faculties who then criticized me likewise.
SF Lorch play 2:0-direction - Gmünder day mail
Football, District Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites are seized in Kirchheim for remnant - Bettrings strike Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was in the home game against the TV Neuler already in leadership - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment of the sports friends was great.
Very different from the TV hypocrisy: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly met with 0:1 in the back, but after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the table peak, the SGBs could have a 3:0 at the top of the table.
Gladbach plays two-fold leadership - Schalke without Embolo with the first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the fools play a lead twice.
Schalke arrives against Mainz for the first season (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has managed in the first five league games with early countertors.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco put back that strength on the day with which it had occupied the first place behind the Bayer during the last season.
Alessandro Crew brought the homeequipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka by head in the head, thereby, the hosts preserved the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is new from the top of the Federal Liga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2 rescue, but in the second half of the season, it was still 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, exchanged by Favre in the 63th minute, provided a further doublette in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic before the break dezimated Werder Bremen, the Stuttgarter had to be afraid.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticed Goalie Ron-Robert goals fabrified a courageous invoice owner who held the guests in the 68th minute for compensation.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang experienced no complete happiness, but also no debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zacaria and Long, gave a two-fold leader out of hand, played at last 2:2 and still waiting for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation at 1:1 Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Federal Legator.
Yann was unmighty at the flat-shot of 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was the second contradictor after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are very exciting.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a goal guitar in the storm of the fools.
Contrary to Wolfsburg, the French record purchases coming from OGC Nice met for the third time in succession and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is occupied by the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously uncovered Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart manoeuvred into an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart conter, which the Ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season meeting, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: The 23-year servant casted after a tricotzupfer against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's Defense Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert targets brought the Bremer back to the game by a courageous incast owner (68.) a quarterly hour before the end, the Gonzalo Castro shot back to the victory street.
Nürnberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team through Foulpenalty on course.
Macedonians agree with new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million people today agree on whether the name of their country is to be changed in northern Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three decades of swelling conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be solved.
Athens had been on a change of name because of his Northern Province and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become a quick member of Nato at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian crushed three pensionists brutally and injured her in part.
The 41-year-old asylum advertiser had randalized on Friday at 22 o'clock in the refugee gases in Alsergrond.

SPD politicians: John Kahrs marrys his friend
Almost a year after the marriage has entered into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-year friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the yaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had said before the "Image" newspaper.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD federal fraction and one of the speakers of the Seaheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD-wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited with an indignant lookout on June 30, 2017.
Thus he had suggested Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "rolled" in the topic.
"That was your shabowski-Moment," he said in the play of the accidental proclaiming of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, pairs of equal sex have been able to marry just as Heterosexuals.
Before they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 metres cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizen's Association of Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hills around the gardens of the inhabitants of the plunderhouse should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce the costs," said the Chairman of the Citizen Association Walter Schröer.
And it also collected something like that.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a shape cut.
Because in spring, the hooks have been cut off.
The breakfast following on work has also been a long tradition.
"It's supposed to be all with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the canuslalom WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the Goldmedaille at the end of the canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put a perfect walk on the Olympia Streck on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympia brown with three hundredths of customers.
I was well prepared, had already enough riding here on the plant and it's all right today," said the Olympia third of London 2012.
For the purpose, he threw away his paddle for joy and ranked both arms vigilantly to the height - well-known that it would be enough for at least one medal.
He always had start number four.
But the six still remaining launchers couldn't top his fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
Secondly, the Czech Republic became Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.

The days will be shorter - that will make inbreakers use again.

Pleite at Hertha: Get from reality: Bayern against Ajax requested
The predicate is unsuccessful: The defeat in Berlin will not let the FC Bayern fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small depth of performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase for the coins to the larger falling depth.
"A week ago you had the impression, we're unquestionable.
Now, a bit of the reality has come to us," said Thomas Müller after the earned 0:2 downlay at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, he knows that this is really annoying us and that's why we give us a gas to Tuesday.
For the first time, for more than one year, no own gate shot, as at the same time of the pre-saison two compulsory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football bundesliga first lost at Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-gen-tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stack across the outside have delivered two blow-ups, as the last excessive bayers are to crack in three days.
"The ones who know the FC Bayern know that we don't let us like this and we will do everything so that we can succeed again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, with his losers in his city of birth, he surprisingly walked and pushed his first defeat as a coach coach of council only on the re-defective dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the country play break, the first intermediate phase of his term of office would nevertheless be positive - otherwise the sound would probably be sharpening.
Thus, before the second king class of this season after the 2:0 in Benfica Lisbon, Kovac did not also undertake extraordinary measures.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax, which had also forced the optake AEK Athens with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost pokalfinale against the intrusion of Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich Klarxt spoke mostly.
The legal defendant appeared in the role as a Mahner.
"I don't think that this is all peak, we have to work it again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed just before the departure from the Olympia Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bayers were even with five counters behind Dortmund, which have now taken the top with one point of front.
And so Kimmich valued with an eyebucking at least positive that now the public debate on the supposedly unsuccessful Bayern has ended.
"Yes, that's already good," said the national player.
It's already good for the Liga.
DFB boss in shotline: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With heavy prosecutions, Turkish President Erdogan excludes Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel struggled around the excellence of the Mesut Özil permanent strut theme.
After the Turkish presidency strongly criticized the dealing with the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB-Chef defended the Confederation Line.
In the early Sunday morning, the grindel personally attacked by Özil announced the consequences of the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future, we must draw very precise conclusions - because we also have many players with migration background in the U-manships - that such a thing is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel once again explained that Erdogan does not stand for the values of the football and the DFB.
This had with sharp words encouraging racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they were able to photograph with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domain City.
Honestly, as her President, I could not convince that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özil, after the WM affair, which had taken its beginning by photos of both with Erdogan, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB".
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I am German, if I lose, I am migrant - that's not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
A basis for the return of Özil to the national team, however, he does not see either.
As a follow-up, next to the Brasilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, will be called an additional integrating officer.
"If there's one without a migration background clearly involved in society and football and says, "The topic is important, we need to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM and the Özil affair, he wants to return to the office as president of the DFB in the coming year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it goes," said Grindel.
Annuals build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red amp in the area of louder height.
He told the pensioner he would have driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady at the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a car driver who had come away from the street and rided against a guide street.
The man didn't want a police in the place and then got rid of it.
Then the Red Taler went home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, in which he has lived for decades, has done a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car revealed significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made an impression and could no longer distinguish much.
The damage is approximately EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal frontier in Emsland, 980 forces are still working with the removal work.
The federal war was told on Sunday.
As the situation of a speaker continues to develop stablely, the last 70 honorable helpers were deducted.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, says it.
In the night to Sunday, an oberirdic fire had been discovered and deleted.

At times, more than 1500 forces on the site tried to get the large fire under control.
The air gun supports the work on the Bundeswehrtest area at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also explanatory flights with drones of the Federal War.
For 2 and 5 October, according to the Bundeswehr, there are also planned "Tornados" instruction flights.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles that had fired airbus engineers.
The smoking flag of the Moorbrand had occasionally moved up to a hundred kilometres far beyond the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that receives damage notifications.

SPD politicians: John Kahrs marrys his friend
John Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage, the politician has married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Nearly a year after the marriage has entered into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the yaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had said before the "Image" newspaper.
If we marry, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD federal fraction and one of the speakers of the Seaheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD-wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited with an indignant lookout on June 30, 2017.
Thus he had suggested Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "rolled" in the topic.
"That was your shabowski-Moment," he said in the play of the accidental proclaiming of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, pairs of equal sex have been able to marry just as Heterosexuals.
Before they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ penalties and to eliminate family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change that organs may continue to be taken only by express consent, stresses Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate institutional penalties and to eliminate families in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death may be registered there.
Their wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change that organs may continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with express consent, Swiss transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donor certificate, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the families do not know the desire of the dead.
"You must then decide in the sense of the dead, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible organ donations on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Nations-Albert says.
"A register where people can enter their wishes - per or kontra organ donation - there is not," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has spoken for a new system of organ donations.
According to his proposal, each person would first be considered an organ donor unless he or his relatives oppose it.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in the head
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the head.
He sat on the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow struggles.
Martina Flamme-Jasper communicated this on Sunday from the Science Museum Phaeno, the exhibition site of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel greeting from Germany provoked the third place.
The latest WM participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as major divorce judge Ralf Laune said.
The Informatics Professor from Zwickau, Saxony, organises competition every two years.
For example, the previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.

Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even competitors directed in stages.
For example, the disciplines include the square root of six-digit numbers.
When calculating multinationality, the candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the chief divorce judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because there are already more intense and more effective methods learned in the early childhood.

Polare Cold Air brings new snow to the mountains in the West
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polare Cold Air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.

Farmers may start on Monday with the annual knee care
Sleswig-Holstein's farmers may start on Monday with the annual knick care.
The unique "green forests" in Germany has been the landscape of the waldarm country for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide wooden and scattered hooks are "woard set" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors spreading living spaces over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the manager of the Nature Protection Association of Germany (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living teeth
The knicks were installed on the basis of a command from the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living teeth" were not only field limitation and cattle, they also provided farmers burnwood and bars for their craft houses.
From that time, his name is "Knick": by "umbling" the beasts were able to develop the dense, fainted limitations.
Today, between the North and East Sea, about 45,000 miles [45,000 km] of the hills extends and gives the picture of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement space of about 7000 animal species.
In a mileage, up to 1800 different species could live and browse up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in the winter accordingly.
In other words, he declines to a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, also involves the wind protection effect, says Ludwichowski.
The cnickcare must be operated only outside the breach period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia speaks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the Tsunami:
During the Tsunamis, were you on site?
No, I was at the time in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I then learned about the Tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that it can also be influencing auxiliary goods.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also brought other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are driven to surrounding hills, on which they still endure for fear of another Tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still descendants.
Because many food businesses and also the tank stations are completely closed, people clown partly food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run around partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment we have a phone call, but before it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stay because people were not at home during earthquakes, but, for example, on their way to work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work correctly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions, which were not affected by Tsunami, there was the failure to inform a Tsunami to meet the region and they were driven to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is collapsed, the earthquake has met many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Survey in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned admissions is strongly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the hauch thin majority for the controversial judges Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to disclose the more than 30 years of discouragement.
The recent turn in the drama about the call of Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer exposed the oppositional democrats, the Senate justice committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the arch conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of the Republicans seemed to be assured when sudden Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends were willing to join.
President Trump, who had still called the heavy speeches on Thursday as "decision", first held further attacks against the women and spoke the opposite of "Luck in the accident".
In this way the last doubt could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply, because they rejected Kavanaugh, "you are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh

You will target the familiar accusations of two women, no more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "There aren't going on an admission flight."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile, in a "sivil vehicle" installed radar device of the municipality Ried for monitoring the temporal limit is stationed on the garden road, according to municipalities from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated against Mainz the first season.
The lighting on Schalke is large after the first season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is a large pessimist in football games.
This was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our violation room," said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blue has still succeeded in bringing the nearly 1:0 against the Rhine Hesses over the time and thus the first seasonal victory under roof and branch.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Crew 11 of the Chieftrainer Domenico Tedesco had given safety: "In sum, the first half time was good, both playful and pressed.", it seems that with increasing playtime, more and more of the head played a role.
Do not actually create headball unhearing
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give that out of their hands and therefore continue to withdraw.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three numerators of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Creature, who had no inconsistent share in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manship."
But at the end, only the victory.
The lighting was noticeable in the entire arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalkes Chief Coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes
The most likely manco of the afternoon: Kingsblue missed to worry rather about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Conpplyanka, who twice met the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a seat," said Tedesco, "you've already felt the fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.
Fishbachau: Smoking in the roadzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the headquarters saw a fire on Sunday at 13.30 p.m.
Now the police find out.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found police and fire guards out: An unknown had turned on a two square meters large area at the Gschwendner Berg Müll.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafamalani, is in front of them.
He has been followed for the repeated time of the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore housechild.
"I've been doing my task for many years to get interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Real Field Meeting" - that association cooperating in the orientation of the evening with the Cultural Policy Association.
El-Mafamalani goes much more easily into reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandably.
With a lot of gestures, hand-fitting numbers and one or another joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metapher.
On a table, the German society, on the catetic, sits on the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Consequently, it is not whether you order yourself politically to the right or to the left, but, "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behavior, then the discussion round is going on.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they have managed or failed to see integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on the stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on eye height.
The sociology Professor does not urge his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual destiny halls.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Maphalani.
Even during the following time of signing, he became an open ear for the questions of guests and also in the foyer, intensely discussed in prepared Kurdish specialities.

The municipality of Pliening has sold the first grounds in the newly built area Landsham-Süd on the free market.

With a total of 16 free-state, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated to be created on the area of landsham-South living space for about 200 people.

So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also works on the bank
For the third time, not in the startelf: Yet, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in succession, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters large Brazilians once spoke the fruit of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory of the FSV Mainz 05, when the Schalker players gathered together in the middle and thanked the chief trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old who calls all the simplicity half of Naldo and said, "We have to thank you, trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captains, who despite his re-reservist being no wreck.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated during the last season as the best shalker, knows that he has actually been ratted to his trainer, not to the absorption line, but gets a break for good reasons.
One reason named "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you very honestly," Tedesco reported the moment when he had told Naldo that he wasn't standing in the boot.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's all the time about the matter, it's about the association," Tedesco justified the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can now be sniffed through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last took Naldo.
And the Brazilians responded to the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself on the bank as an example team player.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry has continued its valley in August compared to the Eurozone.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third best atmosphere behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Marketing Institute informed on Monday of its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, however, the index is the 13th month in succession below the mark of 50 counters, which is the result of growth.
In August, only Ireland's industry crushed this threshold with 50,9 points.
Final light were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the stem barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index with 44.0 points reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley trip could mean that the worst thing was over," said Markit Economy Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in the sight: export contracts in the euro area have no longer fallen as since November 2011.
Consequently, the companies built up the seventh month in a sequence of posts.
In China, industry production also decreased more than initially in August.
The stem barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had first expected 47.8 points.
The purchase manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments of sales, employment, stocks and prices are raised, among other things.
