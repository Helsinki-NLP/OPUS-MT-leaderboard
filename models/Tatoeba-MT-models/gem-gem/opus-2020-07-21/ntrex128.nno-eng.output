Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently contempted of a proposal to re-name the assembly member or AM (MWP) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP.
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wallic Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned about being ridiculated.
A member of Labour said his group was concerned about your ‘MWP rimar on Twp and Pwp’
For readers outside Wales: On whalesian means “twp” foolish and “pwp” besh.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group "not naked" and proposed options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" in the change of name, but added that MWP is not far from the word "mupped".
In this context, the valley letter w does not declare different from the English Yorkshire dialecta's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly’s delegation, which now writes legislative proposals to introduce the change of name, said: ‘The final decision whether the members of the national assembly will, of course, be up to the members themselves.’
A whale officially determined from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals which demonstrated great support for calling the assembly for the Wallic Parliament.
In the case of the title of national parliamentary members, the delegation prefers whale parliamentary member or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support under the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly have probably come with other proposals, but the struggle to be some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, headwork.
The Legislation of the Reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on discvalification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their name when debating the legislative proposal.
Macedonians are in a folk-resolution to change the country's name
On Sunday, the voters shall ask whether to change their country's name to ‘North Macedonia’.
It was decided to solve a conflict that has occurred for many decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s membership requests for the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the people's resolution on the change of name, said that he's going to look away from the result.
Those who support people's settlement, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The Clocks of St. Martin stand while the churches in Harlem, New York, struggle
"The old ones I've spoken with said that in old days there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Adams.
‘No of the parts are present today.’
He said he understands why the bares disappear.
‘Persons socialize in other ways now to day’, he said.
‘Bars are no longer stuck in the neighborhood that people normally visit.’
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property does not come to keep as long as the leaders believe, "and before or afterward they are back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by shares filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical places of the neighborhood.
"The majority of those who buy share camps in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is the day when all churches are disconnected, because it is not likely that these people who move into the share camps will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin Church a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moves out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock leased by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boikot of the shops in 125th streets, a main handman in Harlem where the owners were opposed to join or promote the blacks.
The building received great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to build him up again, they also ordered a new watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and descendant in Saint Martin, was proud and called the watch game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played on the watch game in July calls it something else: "One cultural tax" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the bigger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St Martin wasn't found a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in the last months has become a complicated story of architects and building workers, some of them added by the leaders of the church's toys, and others of the episcopal bispedym.
The Sacrite, which leads the soccer and consists of the leaders of the toys, wrote to the bispedym in July with concerns that the bispedym would ‘quire the sakristit to pay’, even though the sakristy was not involved in the bispedym’s addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the soccer complain about the lack of openness from the bispedym.
13-year-old damage to hai under hummar thickness in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while dying after hops in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends in about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that the boy cried for help. He poured away to the gut with a group and pulled out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought he was just excited to have caught a hummare, before he realized that the boy cried, "something bite me!
Something bite me!”
"Health his bone was ripped off," said Hammel that he observed when he reached his bowl.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
I don't know what kind of hai it was like attacking the gut.
In a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark wasn't a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the gut had serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to examine and secure the area.
Giles commented that there were more than 135 different species of hai in the area, but most are not threatened to be dangerous.
Store Chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British shop chain of Sainsbury shall compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer stormagas incentives in the shop.
As part of an investment in the UK its beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continue to grow while fashion and interior sales fall, Sainsbury's will test their beauty product in 11 shops next year, and more shops if it becomes a success.
The investment in the beauty product comes in a time when the shelters that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interior are now empty.
Sainbury's said they're gonna double the number of beauty product to 3000 products and offer the trademarks Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They shall give the marks L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, such as in the Boots stores.
The shop shall also relaunch its own sminke series Boutique and make most products veganic, which will attract several young customers.
In addition, the parfum negotiator Fragrance Shop shall test the sale of its parfums in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first opening in Croydon, London, last week, and the second one shall open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Activities online and a change in buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores means that large shop chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, administrator of Sainsbury's, has commented that the shops will look more and more like the stormagasin, while the shop chain is trying to fight against the low price shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food sale and thus defended the purchase.
The trade chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmaceutical departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties didn't get some about how to share the profit from the pharmaceuticals in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's rare pharmaceutical chain Celesio, who had 281 pharmaceuticals and owned the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and to offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the marks La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty holes will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also assigned colleagues with special competence to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed so that they fit all the needs, while the attractive environment and the practical positions means that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to act.»
Peter Jones 'rassing' after Holly Willoghby distracts from agreement worth £11 million
The stars from the Dragons TV programme, Peter Jones, are ‘wonderful’ after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with the lifestyle mark his value £11 million to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to promote their inner and accessories mark of their Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, recently known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "awesome" when the Golden Holly admitted at an enthusiastic meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly has its new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessory mark Truly.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was assumed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to relax in one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one threatened his own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for the hall.»
Experts believe that determined to This Morning Host, one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company millions because of heavy investments in product, from puts to stearinlysis to clothes and interior, and may cause delays with the launch.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, which is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman in March.
Para holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said yesterday night, "We don't comment on his business."
Holy conversations "and then we love ourselves"
He cheated about the criticism he came to get from the media to come with a comment some could experience as "upresident" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Said Trump with his duty officer as "newness speaker".
‘I haven't given up anything.’
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump calls a great step towards the degradation of the nuclear weapons programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the highest diploma from North Korea Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘like response’ from the United States on North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with penalties to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"There is a great deal between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of the missile testing, help to release guitars and the return of the leaflets to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidentic, but instead of having 10 000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointing to the group standing before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign help organisations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants had to escape, nobody declared a national crisis situation, which is necessary for international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd Barna set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add with foreign passports to work in the field.
Sutopo, the speaker of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assess the situation in Palu in order to review international organisations for the right to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquake, the country is not specially prohibited for natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built spaces for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Trass warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was for cai in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the implications of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration to President Joko, and next year there is a choice again.
President Joko is also pressed in the case of secular tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gents struggled in the streets and used makeets, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

The Statute of the Parliament of Cromwell will be the last victim of the ‘rewritement of history’
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his purite followers did during the 19th-century civil war.
But the Cromwell Confederation describes Crick's proposal for removing the statue as 'noise' and 'no attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was unavoidable in the debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the British Civil War was ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, in the centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public meanings in the 18th century, and is part of the history of a figure that many still seems worth celebrating.»
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell was in the 18th century, and is still today, seen as a defendant of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one, it is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that divorce.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Mordargic attack and kill Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, followed by local media reports.
The man, with the surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut pulse years and covered with blood, near a pig bulk on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pig vaccines on a garden of 30 May, 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pigs were open.
He said there was a big man with blood around his mouth.
The obduct showed that a 250 pounds of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and devastated," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Monitor camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to eat the pigs.
His like was found about a hour later.
The animal he killed didn't listen to Yuan or his father.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the site.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Even though it is rare, such attacks from pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 295 pounds of heavy pig a whale farmer caught between herself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to usual, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like biting a little bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just need to have enough respect for them," he said.
Rests of the orchestra Rosa brings rain to the south-west US
As foretold in the weather report, the orchestra Rosa becomes weaker over the cooling water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Yet, Rosa will be bear the rain to North Mexico and Southwest America in the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was an orchestra of category 1 until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the orchestra was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific that moves east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes nearer the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical moisture north to the south-west US.
Rosa will bring up to 25 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest of the next days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 inches of rain can create dangerous flames and possible landscapes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to rain between 5 and 7 cm per hour in some parts of the Southwest US, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west US; especially above large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flames may occur due to spread terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against tours in the desert to foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make clowns to flooding rivers and lightning and towerstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total downstream amounts of more than 1 cm are possible, which can create small flavours and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
The four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Some times this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next days, the summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm beginning in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large layers to parts of the Northeast Americans.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term alert indicates that there are high chances for over the average temperatures in the east-USA through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh high
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw at Brett Kavanaugh's witness charge in the U.S. Supreme Court and woman who owed him for sexual assault in the 1980's, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion about the matter continued, with interruptions in the usual TV programs of different broadcasting companies to reveal the last new events on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debts in the next week.
Ford told the High Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was full and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a senseful dishes, he's 100 percent sure that it doesn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw jumped on Friday, following Nielsen.
The company came to this figure by finding the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels that showed disregarded, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
The Nielsen also has trouble picking up drivers who look at from the office.
To put this in perspective, there are a similar number of viewers who look at an American footballfinal or Oscar distribution.
Fox News's hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million sighters, says Nielsen.
ABC was on the second place 3.26 million sighters.
CBS had 3.1 million seeers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was focused on the drama on Friday.
After declaring that Flake, a moderate Republican, was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants cried after him on the way to a hearing with a Judge Committee on Friday.
He stood and looked at the ground for several minutes while the Protestants crawled on him at CNN live.
"I stand here right above you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken, and before he went into his lift he said he would have more to say during the committee's high.
The broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on TV when the Judge Committee was to rebel or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to complete senate and further loose.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats also asked.
Flake was partly overwhelmed after talking to his friend, the Democrat and senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake decided.
Flake's decisive proved to have power, because it was clear that the republikanians could not cry for Kavanaugh without a research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the complaints against Kavanaugh.

The volcano sprays owl over Mexico City
Oak from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centrum for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and the Centrum recorded 183 gas and cheese releases during 24 hours.

Police bullets with Catalan Separatists before the anniversary of the Resolution of Suicide
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrating suicide noises together with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrations protested against self-employed one year after the remission of any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powders that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
It also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent eskalation.
For several hours the separatists called “Don’t forget, forgive ” while the Protestants cried to self-employed, “Long life in Spain.”
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for small damage after the protests.
The vote is still pressed in the region and many will still have self-employed one year after the 1 October Resolution, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which were celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the electorates rose for self-employed, but there was also low electoral take-up among those who were against self-employed and boikotta loose.
Following Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the refluct and elected noise occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed sleeping in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests together with the wife, said that he no longer has hope of self-employed in Catalonia.
"We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to cry for themselves, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Even though they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent to keep on power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the jurisdiction of their role in the organisation of the folk resolution and the subsequent self-proofing declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was inclined by politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing proceedings since last year, declared that he should make elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Setting as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the oppression that we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga-shot gives Livingston 1-0-sights over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston hedges says
Declared Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second says after 18 struggles that train for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side was smoothing with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no defeaters in the Scottish Premiership-liga this season, and will play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Ranger's hosthood for Rapid Vienna in the European League will be on Thursday.
Livingston has six victories in a row, and the main trainer Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses sjans against the departure layer
Holt's team should have leased long before they scora, and created several problems for Rangers with the direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts to achieve goals, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over the target.
The home team was naked to let Rangers play before them, well knowing that they could create trouble for the departure.
And that's how the decisive goal was scora.
Rangers joined a free park and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went to Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the penalty field.
Before then the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the Liam Kelly keeper was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passions were sent forward and back in the Livingston penalty field, while two punishments - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hand - were vivid away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Every player played amazingly and still impresss the curve upwards.
The style of their game and players has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but a lot of thanks to Holt for the way he shocked on the page he was training.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense and organized a defence at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
Rangers were not motivated, in contrast.
Even as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and cut only the home half once, which should make Rangers realize that they won't come up anymore.
Erdogan is given a mixed welcome in Köln
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair the relationships between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been disagreed in the role of human rights, freedom of press and Turkey in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevent an over 25 000 people from gathering above the mosque because of "safety causes", but many of Erdogan's support players met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German State decided to welcome him in the country.
The dual Protestants reflected the difference between German Turks, who view Erdogan as one whole, and others, who view him as an autocracy.

Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards harm in rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a rebellion in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
Ongoing disorders broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special “Tornado” forces are collected to rest the rebellion, which involves eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small damage in the face.
One prisoner said: "Specially interesting guards shall rest the ongoing rebellion of HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate the power of our prison, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in prison anymore.”
It's more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injury after a prisoner was arrested.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious rebellion, where prisoners throw bilard balls on the guards.
The orchestra Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the benefit of the drying area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but there is just such a weather phenomenon that is on the way to Arizona early next week, in which the rest of the orchestra Rosa moves south-west across the desert and creates fear of flame.
The national weather service has expired with warnings against the flood on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and south- and east-Nevada, south-east Californien and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix twitra that only "tier tropical cyclones have had a tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra reaching 60 miles within the Arizona border.»
The last models from the national orchestra report between 5 and 10 cm of rain, with insulated amounts up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 cm in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 cm.
For the areas outside the fluid risk, Rosa may be a blessing in the dry.
Even if the flame is a serious concern, this estimated benefit will probably be in the south-west U.S. which is exposed to drought.
Following dry monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the next highest drying category, reports weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa will move over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds over 135 miles per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves northwards with a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific and is calming down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to count a lot in parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of fluid.
‘Regn between 7 and 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sunora, possibly for up to 25 cm,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa will draw northwards along Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will draw up through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday evening.
"The largest danger of Rosa or the remains of this is a lot of rain in Baja California, north-west-Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," said the National Orcan Centre.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flames in the desert area and landscape in the mountain area.

Trump says Kavanaugh ‘lided’ under the choirs ‘smart and angry’ the Democrats were against him
"Your void for Judge Kavanaugh is a rebel against the unfaithful and unfair tactics of the Democrats," said Trump under a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered under the "smart and angry" democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness before the congress on Thursday, and refused emotionally for the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"It is a voice to Cavanaugh's Judge, one of the best lawyers today, a lawyer with unfair service in the public," he said to a lot of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to roast in the intermediate elections in the United States.
‘Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't say, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are seeking to “stand opposed and blocked.”
The first important resolution of the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a Republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on the beaches, while a strong earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six feet tall, struck against the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came over.
The Tsunami came after a earthquake with strength of 7.5.
“When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not go immediately and thus were they victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he drove cars, tribes, houses; he hit everything on land," said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before he reached the coast.
Some climb into wood to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many corrupted buildings and stores, distorted and collapsed bridges and a moskee surrounded by water.
Continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquake could merge around the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Office for Testing and Experience of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, smal wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho describes the damage as ‘wide’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapse.
He said that the bodies of the survivors have been found during the rest of the collapsed buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epict.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggla, communication is cut," said Nugroho.
‘More than 300 000 people bore there’, said the Red Cross, encouraging their addiction and volunteers on their way to the prevailing areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday to notify that a tsunami had hit Palu, even if the authorities said that the waves came before the notice period.
A amateur video divided by social media shows a man at the top floor of a building who calls desperately to people down in the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, hit a wall of water the coast, and take buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video with the first.
The shield and tsunami cause stream breakdown and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate necessity.
The military has started the process of transmission of cargo aeroplanes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airports of the city were reopened to accept emergency aid, but will continue to be disconnected until October.
President Joko Widodo was planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggla have come safely to the Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city, the totally ruined areas passed, said Doseba.
"They told them that they saw many corrupted houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While the naval aid organisations start to help those who have suffered from tsunami, some complain that foreign naval aid workers with expertise in crisis management have been refused to enter Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign assistant organisations and their start-ups cannot take place before Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It has not happened yet.
‘There is a crisis at province level’, said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis’, we can open for international emergency assistance, but they have not updated the status yet.’
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and families of those who are still missing hopes still on a miracle, but know that such natural disasters did not end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the clothes.
On Sunday a woman was saved from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor captive next to the dead mother say for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mondayi said that some of those caught in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my emotional burden to bear on," he said.
Gendon told him that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hake, instead of two blue hacks.
"I believe that means that messages were not found," he said.
Thieves set $26.750 from Minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, $26.750 stole from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was about to fill up a mini bank in Newport, Levee, USA, following a press message from the police in Newport.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, dennis McCarthy detective said in the press message.

Kanye West: Rappar renames Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes names - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was going to act on Saturday Night Live, where he's waiting to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the songer Ariana Grande on the show after being cancelled for 'emotional reasons', said the program host.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current artist's name, West has earlier said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
‘I believe the word ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad thing we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.»
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West earlier, has also changed the typing style of the name with and without bindings and uppercase letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military to civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50-year memory of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he should "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot on peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, in a time when left-oriented student touches spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment solution and lack of access to education have led youths to join in crime.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the USA should double its investments in research on the subject, tells the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after different parts of the U.S. government spoke about artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, and aims to be number 1 of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"In the doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence, it would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A doubling of the funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough of artificial intelligence occurs in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month through the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he works at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest ordered player of the game Othello, and later he works as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognising former technology competitions organised by the U.S. State, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked the time for the next competition to join and identify the next visionars.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
"It's not China who takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have leased excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen the research on artificial intelligence.
‘I seemed that doctorate students prior to artificial intelligence should have automatic residence rights’, he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association of Natural Science finances students at academic institutions, not different from the U.S. National Science Association and other State Organisations’ way of distributing money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a common center of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House declared the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (kunst intelligence) Next.
The national science association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians are travelling to change the country's name
The Macedonian people resolved on Sunday in a folk-resolution whether they should rename the Republic of North Macedonia to solve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for their territory and has used veto to vote against the membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name can undermine the ethnic identity of the slave majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not cry up in the destruction of the people, and a bocott has sought doubts about the extent to which the folk destruction comes to reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question of the public seat is: ‘Do you agree with NATO and EU membership and the agreement with Greece?’
Support players for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change of name is worth membership in the EU and the NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independently after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to roast for the future to this country, for the youth in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the paraply of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if the resolution is not binding by law, an adequate number of Members of Parliament has said that they will follow the result of the resolution to make it decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two thirds to be dismantled.
The state election committee reported that nothing had happened unusually before 13:00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had rose, in contrast to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered choosers rose.
"I'm in touch with my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital, Skopje.
The Federal Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, his Zorica, and his son Dushko rose in Strumika in the Revelation of Macedonia for whether to rename and open to join the NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a bocott of the folkshare before Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.»
Minister Zaev has said that membership of the NATO will draw investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent of work solutions.
‘I believe that the majority will be commuting for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and the NATO,’ said Zaev after having rosed.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "verification of the future spring".
An intent measurement last Monday of the Macedonia Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will participate in the folk-resolution – which is below the necessary figure.
Another meaning measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of the voters plan to rice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent came to roast yes.
In order to close the human destruction, at least 50 per cent must be rose, plus one.
If the public destruction is not closed, it may harm the policy of the left-oriented government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton Defense and Scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling vraka Brighton defense that led to 2-0 victories for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentine peak accepted a passing on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defence players and reached open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defense, before he ran through several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He came through a guard on the left and found Sterling.
The English spice used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to hit the Brighton-keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right in the right end of the target.
‘Aguero was still wearing the feet’, said the City Trainer Pep Guardiola to reporter.
"We talked that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the heavenly blue the first advantage of the Premier League's battle.
That goal came in the 29 minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deeply inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the course of Leroy Sane.
Sane kept on the ball while he leased Sterling to the destination.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the target right before he swallowed out of the path.

Scherzer will play spoils against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high instinkt of competition, and hopes to take the "mound" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, who leads with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against National Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the second team as most likely to play at the highest level this year.
Who does not want to play with such conditions?’
There is still an uncertain woman to start in Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer must "pitche".
Scherzer, which starts for the 34th time, throws a "bulb session" on Thursday and shall "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2,53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3--"inning" this season.
Trump collects choosers in West Virginia
The President referred in an obsolete way to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the intermediate elections in the United States.
"All we've done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that it happens right now.
And they're convinced that they're absolutely going to take the power back, you see how faint they are, how bad they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to do to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shall not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "sick and bad and evil and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you play documents?
Eh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen.'
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they're mine
When the momentum activists in my local party rose to censure me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs who's been told that I'm not welcome -- just to say what I'm talking about.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-semittism.
In my case, I was criticized to be disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it was important to drive responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes like Jeremy ironically, it was disagreed with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was ‘we want to meet to be inclusive and productive’.
In my last eight years, the Labour MP has a Friday girl like that.
In the meantime, today's meeting was not such, and the promise of ‘snow’ policy is longer forgotten, whether it was at all followed.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every sense is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became partial, when colleagues I used to be politically agreed with suddenly expected that I should re-determine and agree with matters I would never agree with -- whether it's about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't have anything to say what I'm saying, I'm always getting up with social media and people want me to go out while they criticize central policy and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments to me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get sex-discriminatory and racist sjikans to themselves every day, who are still professional and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period has been the normalisation of the harassment of politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
We are no longer a tolerant lot that has anything for all. For each mistrust proposal and for each change in the partial rules, the lot becomes smaler and smaler.
I've received many advice for the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so high, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join the policy.
When I logged in to Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall together, so I would have better public services for those who need them most - if it was like a communal consultant or government minister.
I have never hidden my political meanings, nor in previous choices.
No one in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and who of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country runs against a Brexit that will harm private, local works and public services, I don't understand why people care to throw away energy in asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour party manager.
But in fact, not the only message I have directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the electors of the election crises, whether they are Labour choosers or not: I am proud of teasing you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from tone you in the way I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unovercoming Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two of his "tries" may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr was continuing to win in this very entertaining Tent's Premiership fight today.
They're now on the top of the palm as the only inevitable layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defence and ability to take sjans who gave their home team and their trainer, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We have been looked at tests in the last matches, and we are still inevitable, so I must be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Aurs fortens praise, they were better than us to take sins."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion", which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes from Warriors' lot Melrose gathered, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try".
Climo received a punishment just before the break, he scora and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's "try", which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the ringing moon with five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously damaged and put on the bear, and from the restart, Ayr faded forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, like Climo "converted".
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a "unconverted Bruce Colvine try", at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty, scora MacPherson a 'try'.
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flanker" Gregor Henry away from his fifth "try".
The stars from the Scottish series, Still Game, start new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game Stars, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old player Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, in which he writes and plays together with the partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has advertised that the coming nineth season will be the last, and it seems like Kiernan plans life after Craiglang.
Following official lists, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress will not comment, but a source from Scottish Sun has suggested that Kiernan would be involved in the “progressive restaurant industry” in Glasgow.
‘The have is ours’: Bolivia hopes the court will open the waterway to the Pacific
Seilers patrol maritime headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazona Self are covered with the motto: "The have is ours. We have the right
and the obligation to return to it.’;»
In the country locked Bolivia, the people still remember a coastal line lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict on resources in the 18th century, and they long for sailing again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court to come on 1 October, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has driven, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to see the judgment of the International Court, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Haag supports Bolivia's demands, and that Chile, after decades of negotiations, gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the karismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who strives to be elected again next year, has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"No, we will soon return to the Pacific," he promised lately in August.
But some analytics do not believe that the Court will allow Bolivia to access the sea -- and that little would have changed if they got access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court does not have the power to transfer Chilen territory to Bolivia and has suggested that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert in international law.
In the last four years, the case of Bolivia has been far from the point of view, they have made it opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
Morales, with his fighty retorics, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at a time, but it would be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in Haag, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a exceptional possibility to open new relations with Chile” and a chance to “set line at 139 years of disagreement and rather benefit both”, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, used this maritime problem to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific’, he added.
‘Dome is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past.’
North Korea says they will not dispose of nuclear weapons if they cannot trust the United States
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to cancel, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the elevation they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come in a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart that his locked nuclear weapon explosion, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be subjected if the United States continues with penalties and resists any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington fights against joining any declaration of the end of the war, without that Pyongyang cancels first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many people are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness when it comes to the destruction and that the country most likely sees their weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headslides are the last mode on the way to a handmade near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you no longer need to guide.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a series of large and special headplates in their SS19 collection. The main plague surprises the audience during the motewoke in Paris.
The most intractic hats can be seen at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creatures right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent plague was an overwhelmed, beige Valentino-hat with a feather-like, at the brake that covered the models of their heads.
There was also another over-dimensional accessories during the mode show, including a jewelry-proof laser melon, a trollman hat, and even an ananas - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were seated together and similar more to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creatives similar to dyker equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in cookies.
If you like this huge dramatic fashion, you can just shine.
Mote experts track that the huge hats come for the hall in a handy near you.
The over-dimensional hats come straight after "La Bomba", the strap hat with the 60-inch breeze brake that has been seen on the kendices from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest unrealistic hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk - a beach laundry of the same size as the bikini-coated model that carried her.
Beach wash, with colour of burnt orange and frons the top with a white skin handle, was the most inclined part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
The Kennis-stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach launders in the mote stores next summer – the designer has made so much impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for over-dimensional beneficiaries.”
John Edward: Global citizens need language knowledge
Private school in Scotland is known to be at high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which is only strengthened by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
With more than 30 000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Advisory Board for Supreme Schools (SCIS), are working to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Self-employed schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career roads and the role of global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a tailored pensum, we see that modern languages are popular choles in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, then the message goes to his heart.'
This is an important reminder that we can not only lie in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing characters for independent schools.
Total 68 percent of students who took framand language received A.
The data, which were collected from SCIS’s 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of the students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support framand languages such as vital properties, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Languages for which choices are considered equivalent to STEM faga (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the pensum of independent schools and other places.
An investigation carried out by the UK addition and properties selection in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers were seeking to fill jobs due to lack of language knowledge of the applicants.
Thus, languages in school are more and more important to prepare youth to work.
With multiple job opportunities for language-professors, these features are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth does, if they have learned a second language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a property.
In order to be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically benefit from a competitive world.
Following a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other languages than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Learning more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, there are still schools in which languages they teach.
Many schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested, it will always be a lot of languages to choose between in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a teaching environment that will provide children and give the properties they need to be closed, regardless of what future brings.
One cannot reject that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future to the country, so this must reflect in the educational sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘International Communication Properties’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering infringements and high competence for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bee le faire.

Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts with a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stop the coming week, including stopping in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on wait to choose to fill the vacancy of the High Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming Middle East elections since the Republicanians are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
Where time will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trumps collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is planned for 19:00 pm tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to take up this week's hearings of the High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about debts on sexual abuse, with a expected confirmatory voice from the Senate on waiting up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November Vala and get some moments (drivenness).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that the next week's five collections are aimed at "developing volunteers and trailers which the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senates and Representative House", followed by Reuters.
"The congress control is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," an speaker of the Trump campaign who refuses to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection to the evening can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", following West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia republikan Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is requested in the meaning measurements.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a lift in the meaning measurements," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at the West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows mage for battle to keep hope alive on the english on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup-en trong.
The turning pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport, but one that the players really believe, and never more than competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lease, and now there is four, so we take it as a little moment, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he walked off for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points lead to twelve more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have much to be encouraged by, not least for Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and they have three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and leasing after example.
The boyural shout of the celebration was higher when his round continued, searched for an important put to take the match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His put that won the fight at 15, were met with a similar cry, the type that tells you that he thinks that the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually only been digging deeply and worried about your own struggle," said Spieh.
There are all these players left now.
18 holes to make a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the infinite history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sweet couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that wouldn’t shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also uncovered bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine hole on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
It's the race, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this noiseful, engaged audience, that they are the players to be hit on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to conquere a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European honor will be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, grove spanjole and Swedish into a hole they never came near to climb out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursome are so fascinating to look at closely keeping because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change on an eyeball.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lease in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the team of the United States has the power to fight somebody, especially the state side, had doubts.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after getting out of Saturday's four balls and foursome matches with a 10-6 league over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two winners over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their fight so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European page invited them to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American page tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States built more resistance in foursomes and won two struggles, but they couldn't get the subheading.
Jim Furyk's page needs eight points of the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a surprising weekend, is only the second pair that wins four points from their opening in four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they gave themselves so great out to hit an outstanding Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with one even more stretched 5 and 4.
Woods, who ran through two struggles on Saturday, showed sporadisk brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who bored for the morning's four balls, returned to the partyr Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - ranged one and three in the world.
Europe did not even get everything they wanted on a nice, blowed day southwest of Paris.
Three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas win the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Ryder Cup history, a layer has come back from a four-point base and entered single, even though as holders Furyk's page only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still seems that a Sunday attack will be outside them.
North Korea says that it does not come to speak to rust down unfaithlessly
North Korean Foreign Minister spoke to the United Nations on Saturday that if penalties continue to become more untrusted to the United States, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, at the annual General Assembly of World Governing Power, said that North Korea had made “important measures” to improve the relationship of the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, unmounted the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't get anything like that back from the United States," he said.
"Unless confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri, a known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phasa" approach to the disposal of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his statements showed significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear destruction, such as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a common statement printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit any mind between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "destruction of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end of the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate harsh international sanctions in North Korea.
‘United States insist on ‘degradation of nuclear power first’ and increase the pressure by penalties to achieve their objective by force and they even resist the ‘declaration of the conclusion of peace’, said Ri.
“True that penalties can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the penalties continue, our mistrust becomes only greater.”
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. President highlighted in the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister weighed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, the last five months and added: "If the party in this encouragement for the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the destruction of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Still, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last, when he told the General Assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the U.S. Continent, after the evil president Trump called Kim a missile on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "total ruin" North Korea, exa praise over Kim for his courage to take steps to unwapen, but said that much work still had to be done and that penalties had to remain in place to North Korea turn their nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeframe for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the United States’ State Secretary, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N. Security Council on Thursday, "The Sanctions to the Security Council must still be maintained strongly and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified dismantling of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in order to strupe funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidebar of the F.N. General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there was progress, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea to come with "pass-like requirements."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to unmount a missile and also an atomic complex if the United States did "like action".
He said that Kim had told him that the "like measures" he sought were security guarantees such as Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough silence
This year, a new course at Harvard University has contributed to all students getting more sleep, in a attempt to fight against the alternating macho culture that is going to study in coffeinrus all night. It means that one uses caffeine to keep awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at the highest university often unreasonable in the case of the most basic thing - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep lack on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I told now, at the age of the adult?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- something that surprises me, he said to the Telegraph.
The course, rolling out for the first time this year, the students explain what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improving their general enjoyment.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Services at University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after the students received seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hourly course contains a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee peppers, gardins, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart infarction, brain stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by selecting to smoke cigarettes, Mr. Czeisler added.
The proud culture of dying still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep shortages are a changing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapons against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said-- even to avoid going up in weight, because sleep deficiency looks the brain in sulting mode and makes them constantly swallow.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after having our student he was last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctorate students to complete a similar study programme before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting a alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can turn the internal clock totally, resulting in problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets give Gerrard's men a breakdown
Rangers went on a new defeat on the road when Dolly Menga's article sent Steven Gerrard's out of the side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for taking his first speaker on the way side 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone in February, but made to Gary Holt only causes Gerrard's second defeat of 18 struggles that leader, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-hour, and a Ranger show with lack of inspiration never seemed to compare.
While Rangers no falls down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is only behind the Hibernian on the destination.
And there may be additional problems in the stock of Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head, after an object appeared to be thrown from the remote side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that threw Ayr into Betfred Cup semifinalane.
Holt, however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that his cultivated dress took the punch of his opponents at each change.
Rangers might have the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes when Menga's first article sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-level player failed in his war.
A long free park from Keaghan Jacobs found so Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence party, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the resort.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos decided that he should have punished the 20 meters mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson wins away wishes to the Colombian.
Rangers only got two shots on targets in the first half, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's heads and a tight shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the players, no one can deny it because of the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who held cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made a break as if he switched Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and changed a direct effect when the wings player made a luxury for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly racing to block.
But Livingstone continues to overlist the guest team to play exactly what the game they liked, with that Lithgow and Halkett sent forward long shots.
Holt's team could have increased the rental at the end, but McGregor is lucky to prevent Jacobs from it, until Lithgrow made a long post from the corner mark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new demand for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: The inventor of the geigar counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNAR ... the day when the physicist John Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gegers developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific beam all then, the Geiger teller also became a beam in the popculture, as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film, with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What in all the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity of the minerals.»
Evans: "Yes, no browsing it!"
“His” Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to ‘see’ red cells.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to ‘see’ red cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognise red cells as part of the treatment
The method involves subtracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is normal in many cancer forms, and then re-inject
A test vaccine shows promised results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method means to extract immune cells from a patient, change them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promised vaccine."
HER2 ‘drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, ovarian, lung and colour-ectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and the “learning” of their targets against cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts with a Pro-Trump diatribe, induced a MAGA-lue, after hosting the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't work so well.
Canye West was baptized in the studio during Saturday night live after an amazing performance where he praised his president, Donald Trump, in the United States, and said he would make a choice in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated support to Trump.
"So many times I'm talking to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with the comicist Matt Damon, where the Hollywood stars taught Brett Kavanaugh his witness burden in the Senate's judicial election on the debts of sexual abuse from Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not sent, recording to West's tirade was uploaded to social media of comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to spot West with the article.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headslide.
"They mobbed me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
Dei mobba me!
And then they say I'm in a falling place," he said, following Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Do you want to see the downtown place?" says he would "take the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.’»
His comments led to piping at least two times from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed painfully affected, reported Variety, with a person who spoke to the publication: ‘The whole studio was deadly.’
West was picked up as a replacement for the songer Ariana Grande, when her former lover, the raper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a presentation of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the Chief of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: “For one of the most courageous spirits: THAT YOU STAKE OPP TO THE PÖBEL.”
But talkshow-vertinna Karen Hunter twitter that West "very simple was just as he is and it's quite amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to pay someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') that I believe is embraced and spraying out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we are, too.
Before the show, the raper advertised on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last musical legend Prince, changed the name of a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Stars Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is familiar with the sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's elective medieval fantasi series Game of Thrones.
But the shooter, 31, has gone out against the stereo type of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead to the feeling that young guys feel that they must be hard to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something went crazy and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Play of Thrones co-operator Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
I think TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of very male characteristics.
He goes on, "What's inborn, and what's learned?
What is learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young people feel that they must be this special side of being a man?
I really think it's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it is clear that something has gone crazy for young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones predator or follow-ups when the series ends in summer, saying he is "finished with battle fields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a asshole.
The actress recently revealed that he looked at the meeting with the wife saying Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so it gave me the future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the award to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-Price Rewarded Fantasy Series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has advertised a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are the framework of the country, say health adding.
Approximately 40.000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter in 2018.
The most new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from the past.
Traditional HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But many people who received HIV in this way were reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
However, from years to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT environment of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination by LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studios have counted that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the disease men come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add layer information from the GOP sensor, it explodes in 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiration theories'.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had made personal information about three American senators on the Wikipedia pages to the lawgivers.
The Los Angeles Democracy claimed that the claims were pedalised by "extrem right-wing" investigations and websites.
“Looks, lies, and more negligible lies”, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included information about home addresses and phone numbers of the American Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a senate panel's hearing about the debts of sexual violations against the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators asked questions to Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the article was linked to Waters ' office and published the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
‘This reasonless claim is completely false and an absolute lie’ continues Waters.
"One of my additions - which has received their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This reasonless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.»
Questions to Water received rapid criticism on the web, among other things from former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is angry’, wrote meat.
‘This indicates that it has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They must not be hard.
They must not ask questions about the motive of the shoulder.
They must be roles and peaceful.»
Fleischer appeared to compare Water's response to criticism to the democrats of Judges Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent for anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to overtake Water's place in the midway valley, also expressed his tanks on Twitter.
‘Store if it is true’, he twitter.
In fact, Waters said that her office had announced "the right powers and the legal units of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the actors are revealed,’ continues it, ‘and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are corrupt and dangerous for each and one of my employees.’
Johnny English strikes again - spion toll of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit remarks in all new films with a British angle, and it works active for this re-relivement of Johnny England's action-comedie spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire, who re-establish the openly unsle we are, become the new export potential in the country?
In any case, the great evil, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber angel has been renewed for the second time his permission to fuck up things -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide competitor for cinemavinists in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the foolish, secret agent who struck in his bizarres wants to spread a little glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the Fire Wagons, themes under the Olympic Opening Ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos in the back.
There are one or two fine eye markers in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medium-century armor theme while the rotor leaves hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedie is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely overflowy, especially since "serious" film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offers comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like he's directed to children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny England's noiseful accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicacluse noise in the person in Bean.
The permanent current provision now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super secret web network of spys in the United Kingdom, which reveals the identity of all the agents in the area, to the intimidation of the agent at work - a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last strike of a Prime Minister who is a pompous and wary figure, which already has a complete breakdown of political opularity: Emma Thompson does its best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her informants inform her that when each active spy has been debted, she must pick up someone who has been retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who is working at a somewhat elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine witches here, since English offers a School of Rock Type Academy for Spioning.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a nautus-briefing and reunification with its former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moves over to a sub-carrier job, an enthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little disposed of.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things terrible crazy in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services are back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenkos beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the karismatic technology of the billionaire rebel, which claims that he can solve the UK's data problem: the horrible Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey to say of farses-like wild game: dressed as servators, set the guys on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on the Volta's lightboat; and English tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make themselves known to the inside of Volta's house.
Everyone stopped is probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovable and unisiplined as it is, there's quite a lot of child TV throughout.
Very moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't let you think, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses that they are working a plan for the English people to work for a four-day week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party now considers a radical plan that will make the British work for a four-day week, but will be paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will forward savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra Friday.
Then adding could enjoy a three-day weekend -- but still get the same wage.
Sources said that the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda and plan to increase the benefits of employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a desire that fits in the approach of the party to balance the economy for the worker, as well as to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Worker Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its elections in 2017.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said, "One four-day week of work is not a party policy and it is not evaluated by the party."
Shadow chances John McDonnell used last week's work conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take his power back from "faceless directors" and "profits" in rich businesses.
The plans of the Shadow Cancer also mean that the current shareholders of a vascular actuators are not able to recover their entire efforts when a labour government could "retract" because of perceptional misbehavior.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees in company managers and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to give 10 percent of the equity in private sectors to add, which would receive annual dividends up to EUR 500, about $5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the '60 Minutes' TV programme about the FBI's research of Kavanaugh could make them change their tanks
The FBI investigation of complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the High Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of how to what extent found to the Agency could affect some Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the republikan Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could detect something that would cause them to re-determine.
Kennedy works more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I am, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, "Have you done it?"
He was intended, firmly intended, unambiguous.’»
Graham's voice seemed still to be seen in stone.
"I have made my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite accusation to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Put it strongly, "laught Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all its names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is the New York host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a huge impressive setting of stars that act and a similarly impressive mission; end the poverty in the world.
Now in his seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the great plenary of Central Park, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes act, but also to increase the consciousness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, starting in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerts had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send email to a world manager, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to contribute to increasing the consciousness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years of age to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" -- people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million ‘activities’ from its support players and participated in and pressed on a number of different objectives.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and publications as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe funds so far have had direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and actors who are obliged to "help children to achieve their full potential", promises to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the end of sub-nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 twots from global citizens.
"With support from the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition to a footnote in history," - spoke the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom be better in nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, they ask "who makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied, "There will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the big citizens' rights and the anti-apartity movements lead us, we'll be lucky because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the players who act on the year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy sports - internal secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ because to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an inquiry to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East is that they want to communicate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he must have said.
And following the official, there are ways and means to accept it.
"The US has this evna, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event arranged by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting themselves as ‘vote to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to treat Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
“The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels”, he said, while he pointed to Russia as a “one-trick pony” with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump Administration has been on the mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, the Trump Administration service officers, including the United States President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's eager resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe we share the position that energy cannot be a press tool and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said the Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American behavior has withdrawn backwards from Germany, which has confirmed the commitment to the project.
Germany's Leading Organisation for Industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German office Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to be a president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusett's senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "good look" on silence as a president after the midway election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would assess as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said following the Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider carefully as a president's candidate.’
Warren took up President Donald Trump at the Council meeting and said that he “is conducting this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," said she.
Warren has been crushed in his criticism by Trump and his High Court Valdent Brett Kavanaugh.
In a twoth on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a meaning measurement published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own choosers do not think that she should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "annual" Massachusetts choosers said that the senator should not stand as a candidate, followed by Suffolk University of Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty percent supported such a candidate.
The study showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Bide said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being arrived in September.
He was arrested and accused for a election event in the home on Monday evening
"When my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, I can relate to other families that are the PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about their son and other war veterans that "they come back a little change, they come back the hire, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and co-pilots and pilots and all other militarys have done for the country, is there."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was debted for the physical authority in the home against a woman, to have disrupted a report on the rule of the home and the storage of a weapon while he was rushed, following Dan Bennett, speaker of the Wasilla Police Departement.
18 states, D.C. aid challenge to new asylum policies
A eighteen states and territories in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that refuses asylum to victims refugeing from revolted or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-right short Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who challenges policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions is appropriate to the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her party "and the elected gentle sons" abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large amount of searches for American asylum, which nations face a considerable problem with revers and power in the world.
The new American asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants who escaped from the elections in the world to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Federal law requires all asylum matters to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such an obstacle to this principle’, said the friend of the court briefly.
Advocates further argued in the summary that the policy which denies immigrants' access is harmful to the United States’ economy, and that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and ‘require the necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions orders immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims of abuse and reconciliation in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who left their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning’, said Sessions in its publication of policy in 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to ease all the problems - even all serious problems - people face every day across the world.
Desperate survival work in Palu while the deathstal doblast in the race to find survival
For survival, the situation was increasingly serious.
‘It feels very excited,’ said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who swept the fever-sick baby son at a evacuation center in the desolate city, Palu.
‘Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Pure water is difficult to find.’»
Inhabitants are observed on their way back to their desolate homes, searching for cleaned property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were damaged, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were filled.
Some of them damaged, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong post-shield.
Tears filled his eye while he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shake the hotel room he shared with his wife and the daughter in the fifth floor.
"It wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, "said Haris to Associated Press, and made his family in the city for a breakup.
“I heard my wife cried about help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
United States Ambassador owes China for ‘mobbing’ with ‘propaganda advertiser’
One week after an official Chinese newspaper carried out a 4-page advertising in an American newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the United States and China, the US Ambassador against China Beijing owed to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid contribution in the Des Moines Registry - the state Iowas's largest salsavis - after guilty of China to try to mix into the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China denies.
Trump's debt that Beijing tried to mix into American elections, marked what American servicemen spoke to Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked into an increasing trade war that has seen them in circulation increase taxes on each other’s imports.
China's return tariff father was designed early in the trade war to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador of China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
“Kina”, wrote Branstad in a sense in the Sunday Des Moines register, “dobbling the mobbing by performing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government is using the dear American tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by adding a paid ad to the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at the aviskiosc down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited absurd voices and will not see any true mirror of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media are below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "screw he.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers departed to publish his article," even though he didn't say what a newspaper.
The Republicans framand female electors lead the mid-term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warners Analytics.
Since many top republicans are stand-by and defend the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in meeting several debts on sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they probably want to see a relapse, especially from women, in the coming midway elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they already wanted to proceed with one voice.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last eyeblinks would be enough to relax sint choosers.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national speaker for the Progressive MoveOn Group on Friday. Washington, DC report.
On Friday morning, Protestants “November comes!” while they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate when the Republicans, who rule the Court Committee, chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination was trassed in the witness burden by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic, reported.
"Demokratic enthusiasm and motivation will be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst, to the news page.
"The people say it's already been high, it's true.
But there may be higher, especially among female electors in the past and younger electors, 18 to 29 years old, who, while they don't like the president, often mismatch.”
Even before Ford's public witnesses, as detailedly indicated the claims of sexual abuse directed against the nominated High Court, suggested analytics that a return could follow if the Republicanians pressed forward with the confirmation.
“This has been a confused root of GOP”, said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the past week, following NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it is also about how republikanians have handled this and how they have handled it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group involved in selecting democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who they're going to believe in the cooling water of Fords and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with a little more side tracks with last.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably threatened Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his witness charge, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the press from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and also at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the judicial authority committee of the Senate during the previous week that Kavanaugh was totally attacked at a age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest law-nominator showed her the gender bodies while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Plan Inventor to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a start that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project for the technology legends, Inruption, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spoke that the meaning of Inruption is “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It's a historical eyeball.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memories, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online shop is that it is totally up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it ‘personal imageggling through data’.
The idea of Inruption, following the manager of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
The company consists for the eyeblink of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracting developers to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary codingers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrude website.

Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine celebration
The only English church divine who won a Victoria cross during the first world war that one fights, has been celebrated in the home town 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the price on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Yet he was killed by a sniff shooter four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was deducted from his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vand, said that it was "brilliant symbol" that the stone would be deducted just 100 years after his grandfather's price gaining performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its batalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 “through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from field and machine weapons.”
He jumped up to the front line later, and with the "largest galantery" the line led forward before he ran up with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Watn was killed by a German snickskytt on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vand, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am awkward for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vandn also let a crown after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vand said he knew very annoying to play a role in the parade, and added that "the value of a real one is completely displayed by the support given by many people."
The MMA tab was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a pack Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The account from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in which Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to meet each other, seeers in the United Kingdom were again stumbled when the coverings changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had kept alert to the early timans especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter descriptive switches to the comic for the children as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that at 6 p.m. if the collection was not owned, they had to switch to the program to the children," said Dave Schwartz, the senior Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘The Peppa pig, ‘yes.’
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they're going to work with planning to include British sighters in the future.
"I believe that when I think of replay, I think we can find out enough," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we do not find out this before Sunday of our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many texts that went forward and back, and everyone was not kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it won't happen.
We think it's five struggles instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to surrender to the fan, and we just went over.
This is an unfortunate situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was familiar with the ‘underlayer’ due to sexuality
The Olympic stupar Tom Daley says that in the wax he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality -- but he gave the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went on a further school that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about his homofiles' rights to give others "hop".
He also said to be a parent made him less care about wining OL.
The firm reporter in the long-term show, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months because of disease.
What could look like an outcome in the first programme of the Lavs, Daly said he knew "less than" all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to equal boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different is the real things that have given me power and strength to luck."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-way bronse Olympic Medalian has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance on the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew happily that could live open without discretion and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-way world champion said it was to be in love with a man - the U.S. film creator Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - " surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, which is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference would never have been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" -- he went to the first 14-year-old OL and his father died by cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple were parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, do everything if I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 -- when he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him you won't be in the front row," he said.
"I kept hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OL in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed about my whole life -- to pop in front of a home public on an Olympic game, where there is no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - stolen by Heather Small - that had vibrated with him in the construction of OL and gave him still gazehud.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Clears Cup battle, but he has to turn forma say to avoid being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he often has been for the United States, split the five-fold big winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before reaching the hope of correcting what he plows.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best to hit with a long shot on the trunk, French main path, where balls hit outside if the golf player isn't exactly with the stroke.
And if the course itself is not terrible enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth battle Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the smoke Tommy Fleetwood to win all the four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single struggles, come to a hot start, Mickelson's struggle may be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a klapp on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I saw more, but that was how it was, and that was how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches that are played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Cleaner Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven halfs, even though Furyk said that his closeness added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the layer room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun that got a deal with him, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just to play.»
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great rental can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the road into the last day's singers of Ryder Cup can easily be converted into an unpleasant journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the target line with the nose leading with the smalest margins, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continued to remind you that we had a great rental at Valderrama; we had a great rental at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, after he had seen the class 2018, we won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the scores on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trofee, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the largest players in the world."
Happy about how his players were acting on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the speaker off.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that come up, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested full of your capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to communicate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, in contrast, numbers Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as participants, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of turning operations in the last few days, after being a part of the victorious team in Brookline before he ends who loses when Europe moved by the "Mircle of Medinah".
"I think every fucking word of it," he answered to be asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
“We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want to start with the quick start you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the fights.
We set up our line-up equivalent and put the goods in place in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magic tomorrow' .
Thomas has been assigned to try to lease the battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangement.
"I went with this group of goods in this order because I believe it covers the whole way through," said Bjorn about his whales of singulars.
Germany's new warships deferred once again
The latest prompt to the German Marine should have been ordered in 2014 to replace an ageing warship from the cold war period, but it will not be there before at least next year due to the wrong system and the incredible costs, reported local media.
Introduction of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leadership of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, following Die Zeit-avisa, quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the concerning problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Sea Defense ordered back in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing Bremen class fregats.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful canon, a number of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to place the latest fregates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the roadbreaking warships, which may not allow Germany to exercise power in abroad, will already be elapsed when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125 freight made headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little known about the causes of the return, but German media quoted a number of important 'software and hardware errors' that made the warship unusual if they were placed on a battle task.
Software errors were particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the work forces of older Bremen fregates.
It also appeared that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also be a problem.
It is said to have reached distortions €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the introductory €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the most recent fregates are particularly important in the light of the last warnings that Germany’s fleet force decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recognized that the fleet actually “has almost ended on distribution-competent ships”.
The officer said that the problem was built over time, because old ships were switched, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to join the fleet.
National Trust Heavens on Secret Life for Flag Mice
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highland aims to reveal how flager mice use the landscape in the hunting of food.
It is hoped that findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the correction of future preservation activities.
The study of researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow normal and soprano pipistrelles and further brown longora and Daubenton flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flags mouse activities throughout the entire season.
NHS adders and volunteers will also carry out mobile examinations using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flags mouse calls and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of habitats, natural homes, which are most important for the flager museums and how they are used by each species.
This information will contribute to determining the benefits of habitat management work, such as the purchasing of boilers and the best way to maintain in the same forest area for flager mice and other related species.
The number of flags in Scotland and over the United Kingdom has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects vulnerabilities and the loss of habitats/busteds.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, and other attacks of pet cats.
Flag mouse is not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eye in catching alternate animals.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find faults and obstacles in their aerodrome.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes flager museums very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, vacuum inspections and a few times save life.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flager mice reserve on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland ten flager mice species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for flager mouse," he said.
"We have old buildings, many wheat trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about the flager mouse that is still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other ownership judgments will help us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.”
He emphasizes the importance of checking for flager mouse before carrying out maintenance within ownership judgments, as it is possible that infinite destruction of a single buoy can kill up to 400 female flags and young people, and may be eradicating a whole local population.
The flager mice is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague or disturb them or destroy their silences.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flags and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are faring."
Ronaldo rejects power debts in which lawyers claim German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the debts of power against themselves as "false news", saying that people "will highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to appeal to the German newsmagasin Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been debted to elect an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be familiar with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything good, "laught the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse Der Spiegel of the claims, which they have called "a inadequate reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy", followed by Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would search for replacement for "moral damage in a amount that represents the severity of the breach of rules, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years."
The claimed event is said to have been found in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where one claims that he should have elected her anally, following documents submitted by the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the assumed event and declared that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photography of her injuries in a hospital, but was later agreed on an explanation because she felt "screamed by revaluation" and was concerned about "to become publicly softened."
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change busted when it continues to be traumatized by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was on the edge to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the claimed attack, and in summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million agreement.
Brexit: UK 'will always undo' to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will undo it forever” if it lost its status as world leader before car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He noted that it was “om” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-contracted Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150.000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see the production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with what car manufacturers say are the risk of supply chain in case of a non-contract Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the limits that the industry can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventories at their Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is ‘net calibrated to avoid the border controls.’
"We need an appointment. We want to have the best agreement that, as I say, will allow, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to arrest this possibility, "he told the BBC Radio 4's day program.
“Proof not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production was to be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the installation, said that his members are more busy: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson to the government said, "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with nestleier lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back one week" as the fight against the High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special council Robert Mueller, which examines Russian elected mixtures, links between Trump assistants and Russia and potential obstacles to the law of the President.
Corvidt Trump will dismiss the general to the lawyers or not, and thus put Mueller's self-confrontation in danger, has given food to Washington sladder for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a rental to register conversations with Trump and possibilities to remove the president using the 25th change.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to say up.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was advertised for Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferred" to not kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deferred to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission's hearing, where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual tragedy, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote from the Senate.
Trump his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked for the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There has been no date. It may be this week, but I can and see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens in the High Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the pressure up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a disagreement with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, even though she said, "I'm not inconsistent that they do it."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," said she - right enough without committing evidence of the claim. "We have looked at speech."
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it like this, and you've seen us do it often in the past weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump willingly accept questions when traveling from the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual that the president holds press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he did lead the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Hospital Secretary writes about Brexit-frequency to workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to workers from the EU who work at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months left before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to accept the costs of applications which have the status of EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations have continued to withdraw between the United Kingdom and the EU, and it approaches the expected conclusion of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand this must be a difficult time for you all.
That's why I'm going to repeat the price I looked at the contributions to all, regardless of what nationality they have.
EU colleagues, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and address work in the health sector and benefit patients and societies.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we want you to be here.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing acute operation after head damage
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after dragging a head damage when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the report The Tennessean.
The main trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the reporter that the damage happened right before break.
"He came to the sidebar and collapsed, in some way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
A official speaker from Tennessee State, WSMV told us that Abercrombie was finished operating at Vanderbilt medical center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet," said Harris, and suggested that Tennessee State still try to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes the second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five cabs before he was injured in Saturday's struggle, and is now up for 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless, following the new plans of the conservatives.
Determined will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The State Box expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will today advertise that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decisive will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has had to attract young choosers who tend much, with a promise of offering rhythmous neighborhoods.
The increase in the document fee will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds shall strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of strippers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on busted two and rental places, may be as much as three percent.
The State Box expects that determined will get up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, making prices higher, and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the busted market.
Many prosperous areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who are most of the time in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson was going to cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large design company to keep the prices up by obtaining property, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas of rhyme busteds in order to fix the United Kingdom 'bustadskam'.
Corbyn has announced a series of obvious suggestions for busted reforms, including controlled rentals and the termination of exhibitions without reason.
He wants and gives more power to build new buildings.
May said, "I said last year I would dedicate my position to bring back the British dream -- that life should be better for each new generation.
That means fixing the corrupt busted market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right that it should be equally simple for individuals who are not living in the United Kingdom, or a foreign company, to buy busteds as it is too hard-working, British residents.
Too many people have the dream of their own busted ports too far away, and the audmyking by being strokes is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "finite ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The shot (42) is familiar with the challenge of reliving the club from north-east. Preliminaryly, they are on third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in summer, after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
‘I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B battle, and that was it," said Ross to Scotland BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hamden in team with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
The possibility can only come if I have success as a club manager.»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager, including Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he has previously turned off approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success will be measured for me in whether I can 'feel this club back in the Premier League.'
In the light of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they hear home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I probably can only view myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career as the manager, after a period of assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts training device.
He then helped Alloa come from decoration to third level, and transformed St Mirren, who was on the way to move down, to title winners in the mastership series the following season.
And Ross says he knows more comfortable now than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road-separator," he said about leading Alloa.
"I truly thought that being the manager fits me much better than being a player.
That's the most bizart out, because I did it well, tend well and liked it relatively okay.
But spelling can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're enough to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it's known that it's right to be the manager.
I always wish to be manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body throughout my grown life."

Study shows that the perfect time of a half-litre is at 17.30 on a Saturday
The summer's hot wave has led to an increase in the inflammation of stranger pubars in the United Kingdom, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the hall increased by 2.7 per cent in the childhood -- but for the restaurant industry it fell by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Corporate adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The present sun, and that England was in the VM longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June where pubars went up 2.8 percent, just that restaurants remained even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and bares like sell drinks, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar like selling food, got and notice the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bares, the sale of drinks had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen three percent.
Paul Newman, analyzer of travel and leisure at RSM, said: "This results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the influence of a huge social or sports event, will still be the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-life industry.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear. A reduction in the sale of 4.8 percent per year will be hurt to get on the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-driven operators. The time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give an extended breathing room.»
The total sales sucking across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, which reflects the decline in the release of brands.

One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Exploration of 20 000 students on advance reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "head" profile they show parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - creates profiles on social media that they keep secret for adults.
An investigation among 20 000 students on continuing school revealed a significant increase in false Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while having private profiles.
A mother who snumbled over the secret side to her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to ‘select me’.
Research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) on various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to have private users.
The Chief of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It is unrecognizing that so many teenagers will be tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the athletes’ in the Scottish Free Sports Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-administrative Director in the annual General Assembly of the Board.
Doyle is the most decorated free sports practitioner in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great possibility for those leading sports to benefit from its extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
“Eilidh has great respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world’s free sports society, and we are sure that the free right in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board”, said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for the practitioners, and I hope I can contribute and help the sports in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was not able to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today it's one month since I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was just the time that could tell me if I'm going to be good again, or in what degree.
It's been an exhaustive work, but I've been very good again, learned to go again, and today I'm making flexibility beefs!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!»
Divided meanings on the Internet on breast pump appliances comparing mothers with milk cows
A breast pump company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with milk cattle.
To mark what is described as “the first silent, seated breast pump of the world”, the Elvie technology company released a small frequent advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers to extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled cave with cows, to a song that includes text like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "in case you didn't notice it, this is not spenning, it's my pops."
The refrigerator continues: "Pull it out, pump it out, I eat these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
The advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversials on the web.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights "crasement" in the maize industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, just that the calves are stolen from the days after birth only," one writes.
Elvie breast pump is discrete in an ammonia BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘It is understandable enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their kids?»
Another added: "For a rational removal of advertising."
Others defended the advertising, and a lady insisted that she seems to be “fast”.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a genial product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising directed to mothers such as pumps ( often at work or on toilets) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertising that shrinks or judges the meiery industry.»
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all dance with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
On the other hand, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no leases or pipes, and its discrete inside a breast-BH, which gives women freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: ‘The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that requires a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk beef, we wish to put a search light on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, and at the same time demonstrate the immense freeness of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognisable manner.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headers.
During the motif in London, one mother to two showed up on the podie for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move in silence to tent camp at the border to Texas
The number of immigrants in prison has risen even though monthly border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Strong Policies of the Trump Administration have made it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have our undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that it can threaten their own potential to stay in the country.
The risk of the increase in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are required to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed the immigration and customs enforcement of the Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to be sponsor for unemployed minors.
The Agency later confirms that 70 percent of the arrested persons had nothing on their scroll sheets already.
“Narr 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue pursuing these men," said Albence.
As a result of adding in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now must be in court before one month has gone, against the previous 60 days.
Many want to participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to get tried to conduct an immigration judgment.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer children are in maintenance, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to electoral outbreaks or robbery freeness, say they inserted into the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last months say the same thing.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that there are signs of children wearing.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally, or to say hatred to friends, can strengthen traumas that many already have worked with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish employees to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked that Syrian refugees come home, even though the country is now in war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who acts and acts as minister of the state, said that prominent forces remain illegal on Syrian earth under the pocket of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated from it".
‘They must withdraw immediately and without delay’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost life since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a sacred struggle until all Syrian territories have been cleaned” for both terrorist groups and “unlawful presence of prominents.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling both Kurdish forces and Syrian arabars that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 drops on the ground in the wary country.
When the refugee problems were discussed, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he oweed to "some western countries" to have "spread irrational fear" about the surroundings that got the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the retour," he said.
‘They make policies of something that would be a pure humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last large rebellion party, has created a possibility to continue pressing forward with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejects a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadistars, including warriors from the nusrafront, which are linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be "extinguished."
The UN sent, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings in a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draw up a postwar law for Syria, and path to the election.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against disturbances.
Why Trump will win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the reselection in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the presidentship will have a early end because of scandals and rich law.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidentship ever mind!"
In writing time, there is no sign that the viewers have been tired.

Money from outside flows into the closest intermediate game
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an overflow of money, thanks to the conversion of the districts of the Congress that led to two sitting members fighting about the same seat.
It recently transformed the Pittsburg suburban district, the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring last year.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12 District of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redesigned after the High Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition on the 17th district has launched a weapons dragon on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties' money-arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress District.
The seat had listened to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with more than 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States assessed punishment of El Salvador due to support for China, but pulled away
Diplomatics note that the Dominic Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama for participants throw out the Trump organisation's championship.
The State Secretarys decided to bring back the U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominic Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministerial speaker, in a designation early this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $140 million in U.S. assistance in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The preliminary penalties, which included cutting to financial support and targeted restrictions in view of visa, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meeting developed, North American and Central American officials had a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore stopped the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal on the relevance of the administration to the collection, said the diplomates.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker of Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that was described by the three American officials, including two diplomates, which were some about discussing the internal considerations on the provision of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is working closely with the administration and speaking in the condition of anonymity.
Studèr History
One is waiting for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
Following the reports, Mueller must have focused on the investigation of whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's ideas attacking our choice.
If the congress was to switch rulers, Trump would have to be right in this body, in which he prepares to convince the electoral and possibly a jury of his equals.
There's a lot of "what about" and I do not mean that Trump's case is inevitable – rather his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the battle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a state coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of blood bath that resulted.
The course of history turns around such turnpoints, and democracy its unhealthy march is accelerated or exposed.
The Americans are faced with several of these turnpoints now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this report revealed that last year he proposed to listen to the president in hide, and wondered if he was inappropriate for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times's description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the High Court despite deficient debts of sexual abuse, and unhonesty of evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of a congress that holds Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me out of garden to tend Sabbath light on the table that asks the swastic.
When this is my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic in view of the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that over the Austrians, after an impressive disaster in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will give a good starting point to qualify themselves from group G of the European League.
A crusade prevents the midway player Graham Dorrans from doing his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good layer," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the struggle with the danger that we could get something, and came out again with one point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything at all is unlikely a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and was better made.
On Thursday there will be another big European evening.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, they got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been hard, with everything that has happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stairs are good and the guts are thrilled; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few people were talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in an investigation by the National Society, they said to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of, but they do not take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says the Vice President of the National World, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and kids: You can't prepare your family to care for you unless you do your wish for good time in advance.
Cooperation with a adviser and your family to discuss how and how to receive care, since these choices may be a major part of the fixing of the costs.
Fetch a financial adviser: Your adviser may help you find out how to pay for these expenditure.
Financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance for care, life insurance with cash value to help pay the costs, or that you insurance yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal struggles before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can assess a power for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make economic decisions and make sure that your accounts are paid if you do not have a possibility yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
"There's not just the finances it's about, but who's the legs?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Federal actors will rarely have death penalty for suspected in New York terrorists
Federal actors in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) shall have used a rental car from Home Depot to accomplish an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the bottom of Manhattan in October, where he drived down pedestrians and hospital lists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused the serious physical damage, following a note archived in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these events may be due to a possible death penalty, as set out in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury survived a list of 22 appeal points, including eight sentences for murders aimed at money-pressure, usually used by federal actors in connection with organised crime, and a securing for power and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “which planned and planned”, said the actors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as “dark, cruel and deceitful”.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss for families and vens of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, it is noted.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the southern district in New York has sentenced death penalty in one case.
The target, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to have killed two dope suppliers, but were finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit spionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On 19 June 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, original from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of anger in the days and months followed, following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing videos from the ISIS on the phone, it is in charge.
He also asked for the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared himself guilty at all appeal points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are “temporarily disappointed” with determined for the prosecution authority.
“We believe that deciding to go after death penalty rather than accepting a statement of debt for lifetime in prison without the possibility of release, only will extend dreams from the event for all involved”, said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had formerly asked the actors not to go after death penalty.
Member of Parliament of my Nigel Farage should lease Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the people' today, during a protest at the Tory Country Meeting.
The former leader of the British Independent Party said that the politicians had to ‘feel the pressure’ of the Euroskeptics – one of Theresa May's Members proposed that he should lean the negotiations with the European Union.
The conservative Member of the Parliament Peter Bone spoke to the Birmingham demonstrations that the United Kingdom “had our out” no, if Farage was Minister of Brexit.
With May's challenge to forgive its deeply divided ranks, a separate protest in the city has been underlined, held by Tories who wants to become in the EU.
The Minister of State struggled to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track after the attack of Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist that it will press on to make an agreement with Brussels, despite the back-step – and force the Euroskeptics and the Workers Party to choose between her package and ‘kaos’.
Bone told the Means Leave Group in Solihol that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a decent rank and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had managed, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of the House of Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his resistance to the EU, he said: "We are not fighting valuable wars to be subordinated.
We will make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the election in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed the meaning and desire to become is absolutely false."
Brexit Champions from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the March. Ho told the reporters: "I'm just saying, Minister of State, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition will not vote for it, it's not popular in our party or our activists that frequent the streets and get us selected at the beginning.
Please drop Chequers and listen to it»
In a message directed against May, she adds: ‘State Ministers keep their jobs when they think they promise.’
Farage said that politicians need to know the heat if they are to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"No is about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: ‘I want you to get the political class, which is on the tip to betray Brexit, to know the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us a statement in Brexit and will not be silent until we become an independent, self-administered, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the centre.
A handful of activists ventilated with "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis deceived the conservative for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is a human who tells us that they can have all computer systems in place and all Canada's technology plus, for a free circuit limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
‘It's a total hazard.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after lagors give say about Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Botta's qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes lag orders came to have a great role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and Hamilton took care of himself in what he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the traffic at the end of the loop, which should be decisive.
Mercedesen run into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was in front of some action side-on-side that caused the Ferrari watchman to be free in the inside to be in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21th anniversary, on the back row and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he leads large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the aim of running past Kimi Raikkonen, which was on the fourth place.

It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekends, and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an extraordinary job that has both the first and the other," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump deceived Senator Dianne Feinstein on a Saturday election meeting because of her insistance that she did not lake the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual violations.
During a speech at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the Ford certificate to the Senate Commission directly, but commented rather that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "smart and fooled and talked unsant".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are mad and bad and unpleasant and speak unpleasant," he said.
"When you look at publications and lectures and then say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't.”
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do that?
Do you think her answer... did you do the document--"Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't laugh.”
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the appeals against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was playing earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's appeals, I didn't paint her history," said Feinstein to the Committee, following the Hill.
"Ho asked me to keep it confidential, and I held it confidentially, as she asked."
But her refusal does not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting, "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.'
While he continues to defend the High Court nominated, who has been accused of male sexual behavior by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own gain.
‘They are determined to withdraw power in all ways they see necessary.
You see the badness, the foolishness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president following the Mediaite.

Analytics create a timeline over the night when women were burning alive
The prosecutor presented all proof of Saturday during the ancillary trial of a man accused to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice, the Analytic Paul Rowlett, witnessed several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.

Children's Passes in New York inquiries pairs for kicked after racist text message
A childpasser in New York inquiries a couple to give her dismissed based on discrimination after receiving a misleading message from the mother who complained that she was "a black person."
The couple has denied that they are racist and compare the prosecution with "expressing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was displeasant when she saw that the childpasser she had assigned, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A SWARD PERSON’, wrote Plasco Flexman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the child-passer Maurice, twice.
After introducing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman gave the child-passer Maurice kicked, and said that the previous child-passer, who was afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, following the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
No complaints Maurice's couple to get compensation for giving her kicked, and she will have $350 per day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without contract, where she was going to live with the family.
"I will show them that it is not good to do so," she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know that there is discrimination."
The couple refused that they were racists, and said that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after having offended her, of which they were afraid that she came to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
It's not a racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you're offended to care for your children, even if you didn't mean to offende them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.’»
Plasco compared the accusation with 'expressing' and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a 'very difficult situation'.
"Do you really want to go to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a good thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While the matter is done, publicity has been quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The author behind the Paddington books was afraid that people didn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It is difficult to see how it was to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very funny to know no wo successful Paddington blei.’
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the dirty teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during his book 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
In the case of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of the family," she made her father proud of the inside of how much success he did.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screwed," said she.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having children that achieved something: you'll be proud of them even if it's not really you're standing behind.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Even though it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on my phone.
When she landed, the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all hast, where doctors work forgively to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she came to do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she came to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, dear you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medical doctors had given her that her heart would continue pumping was slowly going out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was going to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't mourn or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now sailed over the loss of her daughter, had to go on board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just passed through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
‘I put my head bowed while the tears fall.’
It's difficult to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how glad he was in her."
Sad women hang on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their dear who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have the festival notes on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and get people who intend to take suicide to redetermine and call the numbers of the notes.
Davis his son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
‘I don't want any parents to feel like I know me every day.’
Davis, who is 45 years old and bore in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that infects.
"All he knew because of his smile.
They said that his smile lighted up all rooms.»
But before he died, he stopped at work, because he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first one who found Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I am still worried that the creature may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "that people should know that there were other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we were actually getting something like what he asked for – a limited investigation – we might be able to gain some consensus," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid of the "fell together" committee in the middle of a partisanar backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're nailing because of the timing.
The mean in the United States is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the republikanians do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. High Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced for his wife Ashley in that way, then was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents his report?
They're going to roast in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 voices in the Senate. With 50 voices, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of hops in North Korea 'Decline' under Kim
The number of North Korean hoppers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawyer
Park Byeong-Seug refers to data from the South Korean Department of Unit, and said there were 1127 pars last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggler charges are the main reasons why the figure has fallen.
Pyongyang hasn't spoken publicly.
Most of the Nord Korean dishoppares have South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights via China, which have the highest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at jumps as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often sends them back with force.
The relations between North and South Korea – which are still in war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the degradation of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they were some about working for an atomic Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Ministers Ri Yong-ho of the United States ought not to achieve anything since then.
"Whether we can trust the United States, we can't trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we can't dispose of our weapons first," Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says that he can't tenn in the High Court
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to tend in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had acted like this, she had been called "hysterical", Pelosi said about the witness charge of Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused to claim that he sexually disturbed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech of Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes cried with a clump in his neck while he talked about his family and the years ongoing.
He criticized the Democrats of the Committee, calling the appeals against him "great and planned attentive of his reputation", organized by liberal politicians who were mad that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's evidence proves that he can't get tone in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that he disqualifies his way of disqualifying, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi came with an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats gained the majority of the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he can't get tone in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's doing now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal procedural court.
Pelosi also said that, as a democrat, she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he failed to answer questions whether he came to turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court that expects us to say that he is great," said Pelosi.
And women have to swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We greed when we're angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you think?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high business position, saying that she was divorcing when she was angry, but developing a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she grew, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get out of mind, but there are many misunderstanding.
In one of my strongest memories from a former job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was divorced, and a woman who was older than me took me in my neck – she was a cold leather for which I had always been alive – and pulled me out at the time.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
‘They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they water because they made you cry.'
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a Congress Woman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be on a boat called Monkey Business, and pulled herself from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could just as well stand for elections as President himself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made choices, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation ‘Snow white and the seven dwarfs.’
Since the campaign had already passed for a while, she hadn't collected enough money, so she promised that she would only still if she managed to collect $2 billion.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her support players who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she didn't come to make any choice anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and view the voices instead of the delegates, and anger against sex discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous collapse," said Schroeder about how the press reacted when she branched.
"You were supposed to believe that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my grave stone?
‘Ho branch’?’;
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
Opening salvans in the trade war between the United States and China were odds, and while the battle continued, a ripple between the two countries may be a long-term advantage for Beijing, says experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar cell panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth more than $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs on between five and ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fired off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to fall down with the first.
In order to get Washington to end, China needs to do what the United States will, but bumping to the United States is too flaut for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps calling the head, the American pressure may have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political determination in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to fall under is more danger than people have to admit to it before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtsmy.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country make progress.
‘Today the ground situation is more stable and safe, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism’, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to get normal areas again.
All precautions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel from the grounds of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond the daily life and bread of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that they won't accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe guarantees in Ryder Cup, Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 when they hit the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson hit most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at the hole 16, pair 3, and therefore gave the say to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did it well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received the 5-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned out 5&4 of the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbern O read.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 after the English Ian Poulter, who may have played its last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has shared in eight Ryder Cupar, was the most winning European with 25.5 points in career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So thankful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy to get the trofee back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European speaker.
He moves the stiff to the countryman John Ram, who hit the American golf-league Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I know a huge proudness of hitting Tiger Woods, I wake up with watching him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all his four struggles in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup up through the career.
A strange statistics from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 large titles and is only disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struck to find the fairway all the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf through the whole tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, said after a disappointing view from his team, "I am proud of these goods, they fight.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
I'm knocking.
The hatred of Thomas.
He's a unique captain.
All of his 12 players played very good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Cleaner Cup Committee and come on.
I love these 12 goods and I'm proud of being Captain.
One must take off the hat.
We were rounded.»
