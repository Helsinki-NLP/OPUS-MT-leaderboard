I am #PRS_ORG# Grande and therefore it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instructions that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced as a retoure.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today she costs 179€.
I really think that's very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order it again for the better price or do you have another way of credit?
I think, in principle, that children should not be told to take a parent role for their little sisters.
However, I find it good for large sisters to take care of the little ones too.
Look at it, help me, bring the bottle, etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children, I can't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's okay for him, it's good.
You can best measure it for your children.
It's not that he's supposed to wick K2 and accompany it for hours while sleeping.
Purely legally, it is probably questionable.
It may also be that the psychologists say.
Because if actually something should happen like a fire, invasion, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to deal with is of course your measure;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a crimi / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action, but I don't want to attack the title partout anymore maybe someone here knows...
History was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, a animal career carries suicide by shaking with feed and walking into his robbery cats.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapeuts, operates a hospital where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little nick who is also afraid (fore fire) and lands with this therapeut.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is responsible anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of suicide and document the photos on the Internet.
In any event, this therapeut has a type of therapy group where the patient plants a chip, which is underpressed in the brain, and eventually put the patients in the extreme way in their fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intention to death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a large showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the cruel act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even to tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for Wlan available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take duration.
What steps do I have to do after that?
Is it also possible to reject the price difference ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumb nail
Children, four years, have over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumb nail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pinset.
Very hard to catch.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it's going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a ladder plate, we can reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in nearly every slot of the trackwide H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large “sucker cubic” loudspeaker nearest sound capsule construction set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving courses are as obvious as 2 and 4 digits addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log in to a suitable digital centre automatically.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, with appropriate centrals, the cv values can be read out on the main section.
For centrals that can only programme the cvs of 1-255 can exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honest Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx® compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes the marklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
The brake with DCC brake stones or equal tension is also possible.
In addition, he also stops at a selectrix® brake diode.
A ABC pendle train automation allows automatic pendling between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analogue equal and interchange flow paths.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to promote refreshment
Never new Omicron cases bring policy and science in Britain.
Therefore, until the new year, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccine offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress faster in Corona refreshment vaccines in view of rapidly increasing Omicron numbers than has been sought.
Each adult in England was supposed to have the opportunity to receive a Booster dose until the end of the year, provided that there have been at least three months since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-notified video message to his countrymen.
Until now, the target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the countries of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one stands against an emergency, and therefore urgently the protection of vaccines should be strengthened, says Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let's go up!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 further Omicron cases were registered in Britain, with a total of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am for everyone to imagine with pronomenes
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation via e-mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a something more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am abroad and I don't want any officials to go over the feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronomenes.
Has a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only one I bought today isn't going to do.
Apparently, the chair had an unclean lack of sale.
How can such a polster damage occur after 9 months else ?
Only on the #PRS_ORG# try.
But it's been working for about.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted 8 purchases.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to order and account for this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something detailed about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons I am more frequent to the victims (and actors) of domestic violence.
A theme that really nakes to me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims do not let themselves help or think we couldn't help them.
I'm very clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the acter far beyond sight and hearing I can't all reach.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's afraid to be afraid of revenge, to leave fear of the usual social environment, to scare the children out of this.
What I always want to make everybody clear is partly very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, remember always, you're worth living without violence, that's so inconceivable important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do to "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game university, has recently been started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two pillars already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Younger Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said, "We have some more anger in the stomach."
After the game, however, it didn't go - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) -Downerlage in the Basketball-Bundesliga.
What more than the naked result disappointed the way the appearance appeared.
The three quotas were just 13 per cent, 4 hits (all from the young John Patrick) in saying and write 31 trials - still questions?
The answer gave John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerifa and did not implement what we trained."
I mean, moving the ball.
On the other hand, his counter to Sebastian Gleam reacted: "To win a yellow game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people before."
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best game maker I've ever trained," praised Glimm.
While in Patrick's team, the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed in the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate will not remain.
Already on Wednesday (19 p.m.) the Riesen receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
we had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've already reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed and we have resigned them.
We originally reported ourselves a half years ago.
Always pellets from the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He can enthusiasm his audience with new interpretations of battle from the 20s and 30s.
At present, he is on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing of it.
The planned concert has been moved in May 2022 - "on administrative instructions" to dampen the Corona virus.
Other appearances planned in the advent time must also be found on the website of the singer, which is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January the artists then want to pick up their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemy.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-West False lies, Max Raabe has already sung much and enjoyed singing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opern song, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with the Commissioners.
Since then, the bariton has established itself with its stock of battle and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often excelled with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of charts, just as his success album "For women is not a problem" (2013).
He made it out of the nose in the Mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strikely back and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer going to think away from the current German-speaking musical landscape.
With the program "Good day, luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

It still doesn't work I can only want the deck sheet but don't leave.
Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by reconciliation
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the reconciliation of large housing companies, as requested in Berlin in a national decision.
"With a refusal, there is no single new apartment, it only changes the owner's structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day level" (Sonday).
My goal is to give renters security that their rents remain payable in the next few years.
A bunter mix from, for example, private rentals, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly.
In Berlin, the Coalition from SPD, Green and Left Party wants to use an expert Commission as to deal with the result of the national decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude conversations just with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further worsening in the rental law.
The coalition contract provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in excited housing markets and the extension of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky could be complaining more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remember a war area.
In the evening on Saturday, in the United States, several tornados have evacuated seriously and possibly demanded up to a hundred death victims.
The storms leave a 320 kilometers long cut of devastatement, especially in Kentucky.
This governor Andy Beshear said, after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was passing through, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is at all possible.
He calculates alone in Kentucky's country with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise in an hour.
Hello, I just saw her sold out vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or was she taken from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
until when are you reporting?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, can I only order the ceiling now and deliver to Germany that is in the cart?
I had returned a article or surrendered on the contact form and wanted to ask whether it was arrived or processed, since I had not received any confirmation yet.
Enterprises pay vaccine premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees for the vaccination of money premiums.
They are thus on a line with the social partners of the Economy and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logs to vaccine calls - according to German example - will also increase the willingness to Corona vaccination.
He's changed to a company that he's been reading.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's a year ago.
He was obviously not attached to his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at that time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take up the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'll finish a screenshot.

Help in the first own campaign
Boron to the crust!
I just lead the adventure About the Grape Pass for a group of 4 friends and I want to lead my heroes to a special campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil weights and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am writing the entrance adventure and strolling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a furnace with cereals from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There is to develop the further action.
Some miles from the village are intended to lure the heroes up a group of Goblins and lock them to a rear content.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, acts, threats, recognise the danger early, whatever the players do.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spices, 6 armed with bows and seals
In case of non-remarking, the Goblins run the heroes up in a holeway and flank to the three left and right me bows gun the furnace, while two with spies stop the furnace.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are found and healed all unconsciously and closely by the son of the village school, a half-elve.
Of course, the carriage is gone.
2. If a defeat should be inappropriate, just this half-elph takes into account with two of his servants and comes the hero to the battle for help.
The carriage is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter in the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so not only canon feed.
EDIT: wherew, I had not calculated with so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that I have many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I reconstructed the lamp again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can then let the back tickets come, then I can pack the lamp and bring to #PRS_ORG#.

I am generous by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has increasingly decreased, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transfer was cancelled to start the F1 pre-reporting periodically.
Although the delayed start and the start accident of the schedule were far behind the planning, the last (planned) ten minutes and the mastership decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 must take priority and therefore have to limit everything else, so Sky DE has probably no choice here.
Yet stupid, mostly Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Yet a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then in the F1 there was a regular insight at the Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher commentators, so both did not know that under a red flag you could switch the tyres.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silvertone this year, both came to the conclusion that stabs may change the tyres when there were relevant radio talks about this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as the RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for stabs.
I think that such basic rules should be easily known when you comment on the F1 in a Pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or required by rules, both have simply constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally, with the artificial comment style of Roos does not like, but gives that the taste is the case.
But I really like Heiko's water from RTL better.
Continuous albernities that make both work unprofessionally, such as the ordering of coffee at (also non-profit) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the last one brings a lot of disturbance into the comment that he does not seem to take this seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over with Sky, in the outlet round, Sky is the only transmitter that goes into the advertisement, as you listen to at F1TV, there can only be the German sound track without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free-tv broadcaster.
Although you have to praise Glock and wooden gardeners for their work, that alone does not allow me to look over the disadvantages.
The other program of Sky Sport F1 is also very drowsily and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaker that transfers the F1.
Unironically, the RTL will make a better job for the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# pendle light, measurement and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and still not being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing yet.
The First Lady told me it's sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she'll check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole installations.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps are suitable with 2 or more exits to connect to multiple outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the ventilation pump model, but also offers to put a accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air cabinet (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure rest, muggle or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-dammed construction and thus provides low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The ventilator pump is connected 4/6 mm to an Auströmer, etc.... and it can already go.
The ventilator pump should be equal or higher than the water level and should be placed outside.
If the ventilator pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a backtrace valve between it.
Just cut through the air sludge and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if water runs backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is placed outside, you should be covered and protected from moisture as other air pumps as well.
The pumps of the MK series are clean power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, then the packages are packed daily and the packages are also downloaded here daily.
If everything goes well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is wrong only because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the spectrum... of course here does not hold Corona.
Please don't rate as bad only because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively the package services.
Of course, you like to swallow over these services, even if we say at the moment,... they have it fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be bad to anyone, you stay healthy and we all hope that there are also better times again.
How long will it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you also order your legs in brightness here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends Astronaut daughter and Moderator to the world room
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV engineer and four more passengers have made a short trip to space.
On Saturday they were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the state of the United States of Texas.
Under bright blue sky, Bezos took the freshly cut astronauts most personally after their return to reception.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the hole to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds on their way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as Nasa Astronauts to Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named the Rakete System of Blue Origin, and the 50-year TV modemer Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company who had paid four other passengers for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess as well as his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He has worked hard in his efforts and has to do everything himself.
She just fled with that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He would like to return to all once again, said the Moderator.
"New Shepard" flights up to 100 kilometers of height
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, timely with severity, before the re-usable object was braked off from large fallscreens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers beyond the earth as a space border, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third man-made all-excursion of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner was present, who was worldly famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice-president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to promote the business with space tourism widely without scientific research interests to mankind's well and without respect for climate.

Anyone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and find the specialist actually quite exciting and even in the lab isn't disturbing me (has already the anorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have already informed myself about professional prospects at the time that I would definitely want to study and become.
Now, however, I have doubts, particularly depressing the professional prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear great occupational opportunities and the profession is totally searched, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid places.
That's why I would really be interested in:
1) As what do you work at present?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and may interrupt the study in 2022 and make a training for experts.
If you have experiences there, they also like to write times :)
Extra Stress before Holidays & Weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why just now a phosphorus.
Not only before large holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
It seems that there's the holidays before plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week Mariä was a heavenly journey, which is called "upturn" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day week-end in the house.
So what was going on last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails, which have necessarily had to get out before arrival, order here, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because...yes because?
Because "Next week then" sounds after so much time and it shouldn't be?
Or because people want to earn all the seriousness in a short week as much as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully generated.
What do you want to do for celebrations?
Why do we then have holidays if we don't have them properly?!
The stress did not come well from the top, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simple: are we only like that, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed phenomenon?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Caterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Caterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in her Thüringen's home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau into the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by backing and bastling with her son's places.
"I love that," said Caterfeld.
But until the conscious days, she has some to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to finally go."

Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Middle Germany, the very rare locomotive is likely from the design proposal of the model trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with tracks and defects, see photos, function good, the construction series E 95 is a heavy goods trailer electrocomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal gance trains in the Clesic network, possibly the construction rate also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we operated
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had in 1924 ordered the AEG to submit proposals for an electrical locomotive which should be able to transport on this route 2.200 tonnes of carbon and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG decided on the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens shocking works with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the E 95 01–06 operating numbers.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as a repairgut in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The work of theseu was designed to improve the employability of all six locomotives.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed, with the remaining machinery as a spare part donor.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred to be built in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 was expected that the upgrading figure could not be further increased, the E 95 focused on the development.
[4]First the locomotives were stationed at Leipzig-Wahrs.
They arrived in 1960 at Halle P.
They were used in a own circuit plan mostly before coal trains from the hostel valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be complicated.
So there was more frequently a guard remaining climbing when switching.
Then the companion on this locomotive with hammer and wood chain had to re-solve the shooter during the journey.
The damage to the motors occurred more frequently and led to monthly accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s had enough new engineering locomotives and a significant extension of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Empire Train could leave old locomotives and most splitting gaps, so that the E 95 was excluded from service.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn of Electrolocomotives only wanted to be occupied unanimously, which would have resulted in a problem in train operations due to the abovementioned difficulties with machines and views.
[5] After mid-1969, E 95 02 and E 95 03 were delivered, they were last followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were broken.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heater at the main station of Halle.
It took some time until the responsible were able to convince the E 95 as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external development of the locomotives began with the aim of being able to present them to a vehicle view in RAW Theseu.
[5] Since then, she belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as an unoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotives took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is managed.
Since 1995, staff of the Traditional Community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time to an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and external lacquering, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines operated.
-The locomotives were in use on the Slesian Mountain Train and the decisive sidelengths until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Mediterranean network.
The main site was Schlesien first
Manufacturing model H0 in OVP, function good, it is optical reworking at the locomotive necessary in self-work, stumbled, with tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small arrival- possibly the construction rate also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages can bear labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-Parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were some problems.
The middle bar is held by two feet..leather are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately they are misproduced.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'll be sent to new ones.
When are they sent out?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
That's, according to the assembly instructions the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Main case they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me
Can I get this sent to you?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Home fire with two light damaged and high damage
Two people have been easily hurt at a fire in a living house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has been caused in the six-digit euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two inhabitants were reported on Sunday with light smoke poisons to the hospital.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Princefeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But then it comes to a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To eliminate fake news - Biontech CEO published vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-Chef Uğur Şahin had not been publicly expressed on his vaccine status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The sickness of a friend moved him to share.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer Company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo that shows how he receives a vaccination against the corona virus.
In the social media there was false information that I believe I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the "LinkedIn" network.
"From a few months, friends have pressed me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
He has rejected this so far because communication should not turn around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply distressed when I learned that an old school friend of me is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid 19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is only difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, an interview is circulated with the German wave, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave itself clarified.
"My law is currently not allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Şahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority is long cancelled - and the Biontech chef has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in circulation: Ten thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases there is no heating.
A fire had lamented a circuit station.
After a fire with severe damage in a circuit station, ten thousand people have had to get out of the Rhine victory cruise in North Rhine-Westphalia for about 24 hours without electricity.
During the fire on Friday evening, 40,000 inhabitants and inhabitants concerned in several municipalities went out of the lights.
The provider Westnet reported that on Saturday, many emergency power units had been in operation until the huge disturbance could finally be completely corrected in the late evening.
Fireguards and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the stakeholders for their patience and helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities, the circle, the fire guard and the THW for the unleashed use," said the leader of the primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take place a few days, since the West Network mounters could only take some lines in operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to business statements.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m., according to the information of the West Network at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid Surrounded Parts of the 10.000-Volt Schaltanlage.
There is a need for in-depth cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30 000 volt volt volt level was established.
With the help of this bypass, the electricity supply remains.
Since Saturday 18 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had returned electricity.
Another 20 000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually activated from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last powers affected from the outfall have also been.
More than 80 assemblies from West Network and partner companies have been in use.
After building a emergency supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood care for older or alone people and inform local fire-wear houses when help is needed," explained the Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The inhabitants of Oldenheimen were focused on the establishment and operation of emergency aggregates.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those who could not provide themselves or need power-related medical devices or are required for medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the cover is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them and pay in euro?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue brown.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount this subscription on the table.
It is custom #NAME#.
There are three statements of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we have 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put them together and thus shorten them.
Can you continue to help me there?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy about a return
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Do you send me the back-up certificate by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I think I'm almost ashamed of such a low credit.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic Combination: Combining Ribs won
The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are printed on the podest at the world coup in the Estonian Otepaä.
The duo had to be struck once again to the excellent Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a great spring after ski jumping into the Loipe.
Retur of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made s new and use the version 4.5...
could be that they've heard of problems more often
Got directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be malformed report to customer service.
As far as I can recognize it, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
In order to make the colour order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry down with clear water.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later unvisible inside of the components or on a joghurt beaker.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush straight alongside the line.
Light overlap of the color layers will later provide a uniform area.
Avoid fast and fast washing with the brush.
This generates unrealisticly active areas.
A model is not a garden sauce.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones could appear later.
Metal tones and metalic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, when mixing with normal colors, it can come to unpleasant metal closures.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally true appearance reaches the models through the decals or subtractions.
From space signs on aircraft from ship names to ceramic bars and marks for car models: The decals give the model the last sliff.
Break the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well available.
A airplane cockpit can be eased or lighter before it is built in the room.
Even more important than the right tool, such as sharp, pinset and toothstickers, are at pleasing time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal out individually and put it right to you.
Decals is also called water-shaped images because you're fainting their back shortly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark by the nose.
Then you only slide the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece to the corresponding place on the model (which you also admitted before).
While you keep the decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you slide it completely out of the paper so that it doesn't stick, knitting or even screwing.
Suggest excessive water with a household duck.
Respect is not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I no longer have to read the book and log out and log in and reload the book and search the place until I read.
At Saturday, I've already been communicating with you.
Do I get this by e-mail?
Also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp came into 3 separate packages with me
Thank you very much, though!
Then I'll buy somewhere else when the money is back.
But do I get this back without a problem?
Children’s Wish Treatment at PKV / What is a "Insurance Case"?
Hello together,
We were some time in child wishing treatment, now when it was about the settlement with the PKV, this suddenly crosses.
The series after:
We had applied for the child's wishing train in front of the PKV and received the assignment over 3 trials.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (resumeless) trials, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again requested the cost acquisition in the PKV and received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more trials than agreed, logically, the most expensive with the PKV) we reached the invoices at the PKV and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV wants to replace only 3 trials.
Reason: With pregnancy/burn, the remaining 2 trials of the first consent will expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to AGB, "The case of insurance begins with healing treatment, it ends if treatment need is no longer available."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has right here to replace the PKV (only 3 trials) or we (there are 5 attempts to replace)?
* Had the PKV had to point out in the commitments that with a birth, the further attempts have expired?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed egg leaders) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Please let me get the three variants by e-mail and tell me how to get them the best
All right.
We're not going to order anything more with them.
If they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They'd like to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can't get anything for the commode completely disturbed to me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I have not yet received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell her manager that they have now lost two tribal customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect has occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Indeed, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, it's not possible to get me another type of packaging.
I will be able to remove the lock and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additionally acquired hockers, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: Best Low Budget Films
What a Low-Budget film is precise, there is no general definition of this with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find a lot of lists of Low-Budget movies, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's up for you?
And what might not you like at all?
If you have a very good customer, two apartments have already been fully furnished with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll then give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
The EU can, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, announce a "half victory" to the policy expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive infringements of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This sweat condition - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like winners - is probably going on for a while.
The dealing with people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It appears that there is an "increasing normalisation of Pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not turn to the contrary, it is at the cost of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it is not possible if a Member State is headed of doing his thing" like the current Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, so Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult, since the line "Linie Protection, Border Protection, Border Protection" has been strengthened.
Renewment of the cross-border attempt
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have again tried to get over Belarus to Polish.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and returned to the border, said a speaker of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been constructed with stones by the immigrants in the event near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be cared medically by a military doctor.
Totally, the border protection 52 attempted cross-border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border locks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU instructs Alexander Lukaschenko as a powerholder in Minsk to attract them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reported press reports on cross-border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines to bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin in order to stop departure there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"Then the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and proved its determination to operate with hard bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security apparatus regularly swallows thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finale
Max Verstappen believes that Mercedes has committed two fractions of rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1-finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has insisted.
The silver arrows suspect two fractions in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an assuming infringement of Max Stappen in the Red Bull in the last security car phase when he should have overcome regularly.
A second objection was raised against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to the Mercedes view, the protocol was not regularly followed.
On the last round of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, the steps had been overcome and had become his first formula 1 title.
The manover took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Netherlands had overturned cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for the support

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemite, that doesn't mean anything.
That's as if a edler says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
Their i will not both admit it.
But Collegah constantly reproduces any antisemitic messages.
If you want to distinguish yourself, you should just leave it complete.
Yes, where then you're just as little to take seriously as colleague.
Whoever seriously questions Evolution is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has launched all the things.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 100,000 years old and science only has a fool of sense.
And that's why you're a science enemy and not more serious to take as collegh
In order to obtain an optimal view field, the lupe should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lensing system allows you to use the lupe into the peripheral area with a practical forgiveness and colourless use.
Frequently, lupes are marked with enlargement data.
However, these information shall only apply to precise conditions which are rarely in accordance with the conditions of use.
To be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to observe the indications in the table "Technical Data" (see package instructions).
On the surface of the lenses of all optical devices - so also in the case of tapes - light reflexes arise.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less observeable.
For further information, see the accompanying instructions (in German and English).

Yeah, but it was before.

Tunnel sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Agriculture Frank Diers has already experienced such a serious situation during the sale of tannns.
Once, a man should have gone home without his partner because both of them couldn't agree.
Every year he plants about 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced a number of courageous situations.
That makes the pre-night time a little funny, he says.
What about that?
Otherwise, as a customer, I'm gone.
I have always received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between them.
Both consist of meat that is grilled at a rotating spice.
And then both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which is far less delicious.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and sent 50 Mbit correctly until a few drops.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, is no longer the full 500, but the more I get away from the house with the module, the less is coming (i.e. use a dosage that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This leads to the Internet with the new glass fiber connection now in the first floor even slower than before (\\45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set that seems to be using a new technology.
Although this was easy better than the DLan, there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why with glass fibres so much Internet speed goes over the power pipeline "lost"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely exhaustive to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, why I made an extra account here.
That's why I'd like to say more about an answer.
When it is time to change the giro account
Who would have thought that the first time to rest with the giro accounts, looks fake.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fees raised in the past by their customers with all kinds of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest continue to fall.
For example, the German Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100 000 euros.
Now she has just half the free amount and even celebrated for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was only reduced for customers of the Group Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros in Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 euros for day money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire German Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerce Bank had already fallen down to a limit of 50 000 euros, which still applies, as well as to the ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is currently populated in cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts to two stages, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
Anyway, more than 100 banks have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less, according to the numbers of the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal conflict with the consumer centres that have even received right in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now, the banks are discussed whether the institutions may have to form return - in the case that the upper instances also need to explain the negative interest rates in principle for inadmissible and pay back to many millions of bank clients.

Jennifer Aniston occupies a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the U.S. Magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most impressive woman of the year.
For them, who made 2021 with the "friends" reconciliation and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
Their appearance takes care of a whole army of assistants, styleists and trainers.
In any case, Aniston, she gives her a chip on the day (yes, right read: a EINZIGEN chip out of the desk).
The fact that you fly to the hearts of the female and male fans is a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having fun with happiness and still looking for great love.
And the baby's wish has removed from the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she was to become mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medical why I can't.
It was really harmful.
Stay hoping that success and glory will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Raise rays must give up
Kimi Räikönen's departure from the formula 1 was still less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Réikönen had to dispose of his Alfa Romeo at the big price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the Renndistance.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the engine sports class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikönen's largest success was the profit of the world championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand-Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich picks up 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in two-bob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the aim of the Bobpilot.
"I've figured it out, I'd have to get into nine and a half victory per season, then I could create it until Cortina 2026," said the BSC Oberbärenburg double-olympiasiast, who booked two successes in the races in Winterberg in two days.
Only on Saturday, he rejected the attack of John Lochner at five hundreds, where he went from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something on the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a larger front.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he went through before the British Brad Hall.
Thirdly, the Austrian Benjamin Maier became.
"We have gone a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also imported his 22th victory into series.
The Berchtesgaden John Lochner traveling for Stuttgart came after place two before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Felnbach landed four in the first race on place eight.
"If I knew what he was doing different, then I would do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte picked up the third seasonal victory in the two-bob on her homeway.
After it was only reached for the fourth place in the Monobob in the spring, she ran out on Sunday at the German three-fold success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to the world cup seat.
Two-bob-Olympiasias Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came on rank two with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked next to her Olympia Qualification the first podest place in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in place three with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the world cup, I'm super lucky that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were all right today," said Burghardt and stressed, "It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka was a little angry about the non-failing rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the deck already in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't just received it, and therefore I can't quit why I finally asked.
Through Corona last year, I had quite other problems and never time for it.
And now he said he had run out of what is very annoying me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to return it and then order it again, since it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment started only on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I get on it a extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered item.
But we still want the control module, just a new uninjured
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe it's the one-- or others like that...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and Hundemama - once, except that my dog doesn't shout or go into the children's garden, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (from 6J together) is sick, has a burning 2. degrees has been collected on Monday and has been depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also hold emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have a lot torched and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because the hand is in the association wg burning).
He is cold above and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's just got a stomach, I bought for him and now he's been in his couch and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and wearing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now, keeping is also coming to our homework, which we, of course, divide.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well set, I'm half-way well therapeutized and come right.
Not good, but I'm coming up and almost sympathetic.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 p.m., I have a written test for which I haven't done anything and over morning anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral test on Tuesday, and what then happens is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes like this: only over to the morning, then the weekend is.
But then all this is going on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until holiday start.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
I feel guilty and chaotic, but otherwise I can't...
Are you all right?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm really infinitely grateful, I can't say that.
I don't know if I could have survived my kptbs.
I think that's part of something to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I was sure I'd find suffering girls here...
I wish you another refreshing evening, the week is almost done!
I have got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is cracked and table leg has printed.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We're very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In the rest of the world, two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely else: I then found at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it's just another discipline for them like mathematics or geography.
This was always a strange thing for me, perhaps because I was mature Christianly and I always believed somehow.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about working and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to distinguish.
Does also give a learning plan, etc.
But if it could be strange to have a physicist who doesn't believe in the relativity theory.
What then brings one to want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Culture true or something?
Hope you're a question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not? Write English I understand that too well
That's been very long, then I'd take care of it.
It's okay, thank you.
I'm waiting for a reply until the next week's beginning.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film Search Help Please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (in 24 years).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two times (or parallel worlds).
One of the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the ways are crossing and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself I mean.
The transition is I also think the grave place of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If you say something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one just slept on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still live :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything around is true, no couch animals, go into and watch more often, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good matratze.
No kisses.
Axo and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a ceiling.
Look at your child when it's sleeping.
Is it turning the head to the side?
Can it build up from the stomach of something?
Or is it on the front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can distract if everything's okay.
We've all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it was Zb gang and give that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we have already bought a lot of articles with you.
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and no feedback yet.
It's about my clothes cabinet that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the lock.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The lock is not to be used at this time.
To say it clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had fun with RBTV.
Only it is just that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all sausage.
Almost every format is sponsored (ook), but then then go on a large bed trip.
It was said that you were an "independenceal" Internet transmitter.
Citate Arno: You want to be "no running coloring pillar".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone, except Simon and Ethienne.
Of course, they may continue to insult people.
A crogman who is totally missing empathy and trying to make ashes at the cost of the action with the exploded rooms.
How do you find this all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a call, because my supplied wooden table was defective.
Corpus break through damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter at the stomachworm or just to cushion – My small warming friend is diversely fetchable.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional means of house for well-being heat applications, as the cherries can take warmth very well and dosate again.
The removable inside box can be warmed very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure, even if they don't get so well.
The core cushion related to the heat is only suitable for the following uses:
Before heating the kiss on untypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately dispose of.
Please take the inside box for heating out of the reference before!
Heating in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watt for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the box!
Afterwards, put the inside box back into the reference.
The first heating may result in a light moisture formation on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Necessarily keep on the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performances can cause damage (exflammation and burning risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the warmed inside boxes have been put back in the reference, please check the temperature of the kiss on suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your armbuck!
Do not use the cushion in acute, chronic, inflammatory or fevery disorders, circular disorders, fresh haematoma, haematoma, and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
If you have existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disorders and pregnancy, ask your doctor.
If nuts have opened and loose cores, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during the use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents associated with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols of the product!
Darmstadt to Hinseries Second - Pauli is a victory in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream from returning to the football bundesliga.
Thus Hannover works 96 from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it is not also under the third trainer.
Jubilee in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover about Interimstrain Christoph Dabrowski and Frust in Ingolstadt after the failure under the new Coach Rüdig Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my network.
I bought this again about five months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the net part alone is also enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged network.
Then I expanded the battery, but there's nothing here.
You guys have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment therein?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of performance also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely consumed using the polished FlexFold shares.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configureable interior remains well organised and separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the inner space of the backpack and still provide fast access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventional via the cover cover, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a excellently thought-three-three-three-three effective protection solution that has already been proven at the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal closure cage with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill conditions" because there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, in which the closure cap can be mounted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Clip locks and cooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can be closed reliably without tapping the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack from others, photosack bags: Besides the deck apple there is another ribbon opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the largest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to hurt through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily beauty of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel bags.
In the everyday backpack, you can configure the inside room individually (more below) and so easily distinguish both of each other from one another - and also access independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side out of the body to access, for example, camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday thing stays safe in the left backpack half and does not intervene.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable tragedy guitars help with it.
And since the outer holes of the backpack are also completely made from 100% recycled, wet-fast Nylon, the content remains dry even when it is supposed to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I forgively waited for the email of their support.
#NAME# I got an email from confirmation for the mission of the
Contact recording of the Speedition for the pickup of the wrong-levered table announced.

This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
So it's time to see when the lock could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is no option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Would you like another nice evening?
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I'm going to give up a bigger order, but after all, I kept the damaged furniture and did not send back.
And that last year, different from thought, I couldn't know and have just not set it up and cleared it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking also under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from guss and then processed mechanically (bored and cut).
All thin discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are own for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly by evaporating the disc.
The thin discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, improving the cleaning of the brake skies and brake cloths.
Asthetic properties of our tightened disks underline the character of each car by attractive and remarkable appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event depicted the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glances in the water at the southern glowing of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest and florating cities of the country.
Areas were decorated, tents were defeated, and saloons and hotels were almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many ways to win.
You select your actions simultaneously, you need to keep your resources and build a tableau, which is more and more "working" for you (the so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tablet allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to turn rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year where the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year where California was officially found).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will select a location at the level where they can perform actions at the same time.
Afterwards, their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a locker!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as the gain of resources, the movement of cars, the settlement of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awarder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes so long until the awarder moved five times, so every location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a fireplace in which the players must defend Coloma against an attacking angry bandites.
If the players have taxed enough revolver heroes and the bandits are payable, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final assessment is done.
The player wins with most winpoints!

"Why kids are no tyrannes" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared today in my Twitter Timeline, and I just looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is pleased to see a guest in Talkshows and holds talks throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrant" (2008) he launched a strong education debate.
Former patient: women and trainees now raise serious claims against him.
Please be careful, the movie is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to raise the framework for the child as useful and possible in the situation.
Brr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise about the decline of the test obligation for three-fold vaccination
At its next meeting, the Ministry of Health of the Countries wants to decide on a negotiated decline of the test obligation for three times vaccination.
"We countries need fast clarity, whether and from when for three vaccines, the test obligation can be avoided," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The decay of 2G plus for three times vaccination is "not only medically meaningful, but also delivers an additional vaccine," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference on the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How am I doing the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# boot very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping via my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. senses under full arthrosis.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most frequently it comes to hearing noise/stimmes, more rarely to see pictures and most rarely to observe pain.
This issue is relevant: Emperor cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of Awareness, since a very deep nacousis is avoided to protect the child until the dismantling.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcose talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex ** per definition no.
Did their comment read incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would withdraw the defective chair.
This is also standard in the field of eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least withdraw the defective chair.
Then we'll sell the second chair privately.
There we also lose some money.
I already sent you a mail that you have not answered.
Again, the question.
The order and the invoice states that the product is delivered to a room of my choice.
The spider is a company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only delivered before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that the case?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anybody who can wear the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Isn't I gonna call you?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He profiled himself as a theater critic and as an instinct.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at 97 years of age.
There is the new book on the table, printing fresh: "An old man gets older."
The shaking diarium of a slow departure from the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture, the message that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've been proofing my life thanks."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European lakes, well-formed wooden palettes, which are especially used in the European area as chargers.
They are certified by the European Paletten Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria in Austria, in 2020, more than ten million pieces of palettes were produced.
Production value was approximately EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported to Austria each year, will not be raised
New York gets MLS Mastership for the first time

Ready Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect Gulasch.
That was Christmas, and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I came to the taste and wanted to cook to Silvester for the first time rouladen.
I'll use a bovine fund tomorrow.
Otherwise, do you have any hints for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a big pot.
How's it going on now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get that.
IE's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01 that the reimbursement was made.
But until today the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check it out.
Where there are in the room of Lübeck or Christmas breads
For many people Gans or Ente belongs to the Christmas days such as the dance tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought a poultry yet?
Now the time's gonna be short.
We tell you where you'll get a Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "Drive" of a tube ending level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar reinforcer sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor scenario.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME rules, you can, on the one hand, set the desired level and on the other, the degradation content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series enhancers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control to reduce the sound level without changing something on the "gain" and the distortion.
Next up, it was already sounded that you can even fetch a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL ruler if it goes unfortunately.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone box can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or a direct recording.
The AUX book can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot key, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on or off the effect blocks and take the speed of the compatible effects to that end.
This is essential for the live effort.
With its new power packages VOX goes another step in the future!
But it had seen in others like that.
Is there then a way for you to send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commode?
In the next weeks, do we receive a update for the exact delivery date?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I'd be satisfied with a dismissal or credit card.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the planned hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not paid
Is there a premium customer status at you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the re-establishment of the International Atomic Agreement, progress is made according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are shortly in favour of agreeing on the topics that are to be held on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Underseller Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, it has not even been agreed on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna discussions on the re-release of the agreement were continued after almost a week of interruption.
The negotiations take part in the traders of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in negotiations.
Thüringen overcome Saxony - State now Federal with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has triggered Saxony and is currently showing the highest incidence.
As the only country, the value is above the label of 1000.
As the only country, Thüringen was located above the brand of 1000 at the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute declared the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always been the highest incidence in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen was slightly decreased, but also above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day of 2242.
200 severe in Covid-19 sick were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
During weekends, reporting delays may occur.
In addition, the healthcare providers have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind with the detection of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until that time.
I have to print it and stick on the package and give it out at the mail that was, right?
I don't have to click/subscribe/fill here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I write you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my eyes a frequency.
It's time for changes
###First day I am welcomed, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the last few months of the Mappy Day, you can find one: it is not existing.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what did it do?
Mostly, this is simply related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally represented.
In recent days, the impression has been increasingly that many here really still have bock on the MBundesday.
# What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked about the Mb-hour day, which wants to keep it alive.
The prosecution came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, screwholes.
According to some, several people from the Community who like to rebuild the project have found and rewrited.
However, I would like to expressly call on everyone to participate again, only so this project can have a future existence.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Targets:
* How should the Mouth Day work in the future?
* What orders must be modified/ adjusted/removed?
* How should we come to abroad in the future?
* How should new members be advocated?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but what's not bad, we have to do with this at the end of the Discord.
If you want and have time, come to the Discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered you a lamp screen to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clean for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different rehearsal for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# I have to be able to guarantee that the incorrect lock is retrieved at a time.
And I'm asking you to let that go now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I'll mount the shirt for the collection as far as possible - they have to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time in order to agree a pick-up date.
Is there a instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or to decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived vegetarian for a while, probably eating meat very rarely at present.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years earlier.
To the question whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism had been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much to think.
And I long thought that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I finally also support animal quarrel.
That's why my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that came up on her side discouragement, then she defended vegetarism and meant she knowing where her flesh comes from and reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are being put in a corner quickly as a veganian and get into conflicts without creating it on it.
It greets a harmonious veganine (;
Clearly, it is not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for the remote set.
I am on the assigned date at which #PRS_ORG# does not get my retoure on site.
As I cannot be on the site because of a funeral, it is unfortunately not possible to change this.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I have to meet again.
Lahnsteiner weather equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euros Aid from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palessian Innenminister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein Councilhaus issued an appendix of EUR 45.000 for the new equipment car Water saving the Volunteer Fire Force Lahnstein to Oberburgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle in use since November 2020 amounted to EUR 135.000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," says Lahnstein's chief mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they fulfil the tasks of water and ice saving and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, it is expected to be permanently with increasing efforts: the tree of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the lane as the leisure flow, contributes to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
I followed its recommendations, however, have synchronised, removed and the app reloaded NOT worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter a date in the booking process?

Thank you for the first time you put the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, speaking, we were also weapons in the executive, I do not want to go on it!
The question of right and left is always very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the servant is rather from the liberal to the conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in the special uniform and arms carrier, people should also be able to dress from conservative magic, everyone should be aware that then, of course, these people can be hard to deal with the living reality is also clear, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, in the mean, many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not now mean the excessive feminine clinic swallows, because they are in the executive rather less to none but very normal men and women who are not noticed if they don't tell it) and also on these people and I have to leave myself, because, in doubt, they will save your life or set this for you.
But these margin groups also represent even if it sounds queer for the first time in my experience after a conservative attitude, speaking is proud of Germany and feels less deprived by excessive left policy, even if this policy is supposed to be in place for them or thinks it is necessary to make them right, they simply want to be treated completely normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and forces are also a cross-border of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they are openly allowed to say their opinion there, or even openly smuggling any state-threatening plans is medically overwhelmed and angry me too.
Of course, policemen and soldiers, who were often in abroad, often begin to pause because of negative experiences, and even things say the controversials to politically incorrect.
It also appears that, in certain cases, right mindmates also meet those who do a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I think that this is a good fight, and it is also against political education and information!
Germany is so very internationally collapsed and that is also my opinion that we could not at all be able to have real racists and Nazis in our series!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed by me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that's no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you can deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But above the edge of the piece of wood are two deep corpses filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working a thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but I have been getting more bad than right to keep my household clean and properly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and put.
But it's never really that "one could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not (learning) better, but it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses households just against work and dislust.
The kitchen is most frequently cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more ordinary with child?
We don't have anything yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupied by me for a long time.
For I have no incentive, it just doesn't disturb me so much as long as no visit comes, for example, there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child, or are you slank?
Congratulations on your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality, and anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables a nearly unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further marking on the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arms and knees)
To the Focea Comfort 4 the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase the comfort.
Nightless Stretch-Panel on the joints reduces the roughness (axles, arms and knee bows)
High-quality preformations in the lower back area and in the step provide a close, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the Lanting Wheel area increases the flexibility around the backdrop closure and thus improves the comfort, especially when bucking and assembling the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone that is located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-deviating material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the breast, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Natless, thin (-2 mm) density on the face of the cube increases the comfort, density and durability (separate head head head)
Soft zone in the crochet improves the density with a fine-adjustable latching, by a flexible, wearing climb closure, which does not hold on to the cheese or to the nails
Double manchets with ribbon closure to arms and foot joints connect a wrapable inside manchet with a soft, cheated neopres outer manchet
45° incorporation at the end of the inner manchet for increased elasticity and loadability when dressing.
Long riot closure on the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomic cut with increased comfort at the whole without a haube
Long G-Lock P Reflection Closure (Overall Without Haube) with Metal-Schiever and Incorporated Water Dam System for Improved Dichte (Beuchat Patent)
Rise closures on arms and legs
Neoprine reinforcements at all ends of the scratch closures in order to prevent a ride if excessive force is applied.
Neopren panels aligned with outer and inner overlap
Borders of the external manchets for greater loadability
Borders of the inner manchets incurred for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer to its place, especially in deeper diving (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disturbance?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been learned for about one year.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have long been thinking about restarting and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (e.g. fearlessly avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means that I have no self-worthy feelings and are shocked accordingly.
I have no problem with talking to people at a matter of matter, but it's very difficult to have more relaxed conversations and I have been told more often that I'm acting inappropriately (which I think it's already getting better).
Can I become social workers?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or at an open youth meeting, but rather in the form of addicts or family assistance.
But I don't know whether the specific working day is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it's going to distract me every time there's something to worry about my code ("become the simplest things again) and it's difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help ("I should now really know how this goes"/"I think it is with my stupid questions from work"/"he really needs to think me less-measured" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention it at the spot.
But you've already retained the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a date for retrieval
What do they mean to return?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not allow your #PRS_ORG#
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my lock.
The protein (protein) recorded with the feed divides the bird in its stomach draught into the individual proteins (Amino acids) and builds its own proteins, which it also needs for feeding.
Feather training in nestling and feather reproduction in maising birds are very complex operations and associated with a particularly high proliferation for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NECTON-Bio should not be administered during the arch as otherwise there may be disturbances in the brutal course.
Following this courageous administration of NECTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON MSA (mineral preparation) should be re-overed.

Afterwards, the normal dose will be given until the feather reproduction is complete.
Storage: NEKON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can a office chair be destroyed after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to announce that my order was damaged and images were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community employee in reproach to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
We're supposed to have a whale tree on our ground.
So the case application was submitted to the municipality.
A employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus the whale is not part of the statute.
However, in the statute, the whale is explicitly indicated as a tree to protect.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert statement.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use them new packaging for this.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a resignation or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that is just the question whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany.
Can you check that out?
Notification: serious traffic accident in the case of self
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident at St. 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is currently announced (14:03 a.m.), a car has arrived in the counter-course.
There are injured.
Oh, okay.
Well, then thank you again that it went so easy!
Council and ideas for further occupational life
First happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head just crushs everything you can crush.
Before I get out of here here .. shortly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation in any way - so of you.
I'm just making the ree as a cross-climber.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But then it was too boring to me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I've arrived at the third "I google other postal tenders".
And it's only half a year around.
In the past, I have always decided to continue and at least to end the ree, afterwards I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was totally exclaimed.
Now there are vacations, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the rev I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my holiday evening.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was careful at the moments.
Now, the family celebration is too much stress.
And then there are these staring structures that are extra nervous to me.
Basically it makes fun and from outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so.
But I'm totally exclaimed and wondering how much stress my body holds before he gets completely close - if he's not doing that right now.
I wonder if I want this to have the rest of the work life like that - just if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work found somewhat bored but was appropriately paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single struggler, as it is now most of the time the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place in one year as now and unpleasant.
You notice that it's all kinds of us, but maybe you have outstanding advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished, and how to start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me first.
Thanks for reading and apologize for my female subtone.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has developed continuously, which has resulted in the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scenario, with which the behaviour of a tube reinforcer is perfectly reflected.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely in the latest state of the technology in things sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and Amp switches, the VTX enhancers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage valvetronix tubes reinforcer.
This is partly based on real analogue switches, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube reinforcer better than any simulation.
In addition to this cleared switch, the VTX enhancers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spray.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and hide historical facts at the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which has again resulted in a VOX Valvetronix series performance in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisive enhanced enhancer models.
From handful VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists are searching for a maximum sound multiplied here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube enhancer: you expect a bold sound, a now-ancing play dynamics and saiten attacks, as well as a quick talk.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the end grade determines the tube characteristics of a reinforcer and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The valve Reactor scenario of any VT+ enhancer, which has a 12AX7 tubes, is perfectly the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound characteristic of a tube reinforcer.
NBA: Despite 20 points by Wagner: Lose Magic at Clippers
The settlement series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main case is also adaptable: with three individually place-and-foldable clamp closure parts, it is entirely adjusted according to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of cameras - from mirror system cameras of all size orders to full-format mirrors.
What eventually fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
Possible coating would be a DSLR camera with an employee lens, two to three interchange objects and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more objectives.
In addition, a lot of accessories can be confused.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-extra things.
Drohnen pilots also meet an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably longer in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the Lavaströms have caused great damage on the Canary island.
Is a end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
Until now, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in the past days, but volcanologists still don't dare foresee when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the State TV broadcaster RTVE.
Injury in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 housing and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This is almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to over EUR 900 million.
Before the coast, two new landings were created by cold Lava with a size of about 50 hectares.
Especially the island's major banana cultivation, of which about half of about 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and were already in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas stands before the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many bunting gifts under the Christmas tree have associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crustling tension something leaderous in itself.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still keep our increasingly split society together.
It is therefore more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the donation, which, after the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel mouse, had been a peace-intensive "Community Contract of Natural Peoples", had been disappeared by the staring routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
As from Nikolaus the Christian kid became
Strictly, it was the Protestants, through which Christmas days were closely linked to the cupboard.
Previously on Nikolao's day, gifts were transferred to some kind.
The background of this popular seed today is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra had thrown three women secret gold into her window in one night to save another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular use in Germany was shown to fill the boots, especially the children, with gifts.
Protestants rejected this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and men as "Heily Devotion".
For these reasons they retain themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian kid from Nikolaus and founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the cup moved on the sanctuary.
However, since most Protestants do not see such details so closely, it is only the least that the use of the Holy Nikolaus is similar to the Martinssingen and Martinsing use is still a strong part of the pre-night time.
Today you will find in stabs before the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watchs everything the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of the Holy Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of the gift moved to Heiligabend.
However, in all Christianly prominent countries, a joyful cuddle mould is a question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on the holy evening or on the Christmas man, which is, in principle, a type of Nikolaus, which was assigned some own species with the time.
These include, for example, his white noise bearing, which has only a little more common with the more stringent assyrian bearing of the historical figure, its sleeve, which is drawn by retirement and the preference of the chain to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while it is the Hexe Befana in Italy that should have shown them the way to the son of Jesus.
In Scandinavians, the gifts sometimes bring the fabels, while in Russia it brought fathers Frost to some praise.
Here it is not cleaner, but three horses who as a troika draw his sleeve.
In Czech Republic, the parent country of the reformation of the Hussian wars, the Christkind is responsible for the transfer of the gifts.

Police shoots mutate bankrupts near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told that callers had reported a man who should have gone with a gun to a bank and the business of a bookmaker.
According to the authorities, the man flew in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
There were shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the door.
The police didn't get out of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are set.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other families of the royal family also live there.

In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that are lying indoorly colored.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is very harmless: solarly the sun ensures that this sunlight shines fascinating – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different colors).
The edgeless, amorphe design is consciously selected: Like a naturally shaped large valley, this modern light object presents itself at day.
Its organic rounds fit in every natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the racing or in the stone bed.
He also makes himself good in the neighborhood of larger Kiesel and Finnlinge, where he knows thanks to his size.
Large preparations can be saved: As a solar light, “Smart Stone” requires neither pipelines nor batteries.
Put the “light stone” to any place that appears from the sun.
Two surrounded earth skies ensure a steady stop when needed.
The math white plastic cabin itself is robust and wet.
His solar module hides “Smart Stone” discrete in its inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery already loads when sunlight falls on the cabin.
In the case of inbreaking damping, “Smart Stone” begins to light self-activity; in which color you choose: equally six attractive light colors – besides daylight white – you can choose.
Finally, the shutdown will also be done automatically when the battery load level is reduced to a given minimum or will be light again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the load cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times, it doesn't work.

Arrow Problem
Hello, honey, female people,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year saved.
To my problem: I started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again because by chronic illnesses I have to take enough medicines that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had got from 0 to 100 explosion-arted pickel and these everywhere.
Too superficial, but I was very exaggerated and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of breaking, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe somebody has any hints to avoid this time.
Without perfume, my cosmetics are already available, but maybe there is what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the woman's doctor hasn't taken me so seriously and the skin doctor's date is still coming.
Thank you very much for each one who read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is so neat.
Had prebupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then spacious knee flee and the acne theme.
I also tried food during the course of chr. disease all possible and remained hanging on sugar, milk and meat food mixed because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply in the worm, but if you have a building site everywhere, you would rather not go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had all of her colleague semina o.a.
Written and now I lost the Konversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Please check my banking data, maybe there was something wrong

110-kV Earth cable is rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the release of the new high voltage cable in Tann is legally powerful.
The plan fixing decision of the government of Niederbayern will free the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This now communicated to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The cable of about seven kilometres will connect the surroundings of Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt leadership between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected close to the locality of Edermanning at Reut to a mass of the release.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has just arrived in parts to us.
The blue Betsell number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Unable to provide".
All three other packages have arrived so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that I have explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a commodity of glass and the entire sides are placed, so it is all over glass and the carton is broken
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# provisions
That means that the commodity cannot be retrieved because no one in my apartment is allowed to be clean.
Thank you for the message
But why only EUR 20?

No, it's all books, that's why the request is #PRS_ORG# because it's probably a general problem
Ref: Plan education (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, the teaching is fun, but I have still great problems at present to plan my time-effective teaching in the field of Earth Science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can in principle only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, I can only copy s/w free of charge (which is nervous for exploration).
I just need a very long time now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the issue of geofactors and I actually stand for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
I'm always going out of the goal of learning (which I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I'm making a sheet of texts from books that don't have my school).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most tasks in the book.
That is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe a university teacher can help me work time-effectively with the book.
I'd really be glad.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to take the retoure as fast as possible for the first time.
Trade fears because of the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most businesses, only who is vaccinated or healed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complained infringement.
A possible solution is also ready.
The 2G regulations ruin the important Christmas business from the view of the trade association of Germany (HDE).
In the case of businesses with articles of non-day need, sales breakdowns are to be complained, criticised HDE main business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey below 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already depreciated the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Consequently, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis rates in the past week.
It's only in food retail and in the online area.
The association demanded the consequences of dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business leader.
"2G does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current rules shocked customers and demanded high staff use.
The bandage scheme had to be approved throughout the market, he demanded.
After that, every customer had to be controlled only once to 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the received band on this day.
In addition, in retail trade - as already in the public transport of the 3G rules (vaccinated, healed or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
Also the real estate group specialized in shopping centres Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Lastly, without 2G, the frequencies were 75% of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90%.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "economic week".
Due to the high personal and administrative efforts, the Centre is trying to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called bandlet solution, where "the visitors, for example, can bring their 2G reference once in a central place in the centre and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops without disturbance". dpa
I have recently received the #PRS_ORG# and delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cashed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sticked.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour output.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities provides for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the Flash Storage.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light generates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flaming free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
In addition, in reporting situations in small spaces or short intervals.
You can virtually adjust the brightness without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the movie set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 -Controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted at difficult accessible positions.
On the back of the light is the control panel, it consists of keys and a lighting display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the volume of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
In order to perform the settings of individual settings on the storage spaces, one of the memory keys is simply used and completed by longer pressing.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so when newly activated, the familiar situation is resisted - very practical when studio work, for example, when the camera is adjusted to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the possibility of the operation with favourable NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the battery has sufficient power - it is a battery test equal to built - for each of the two battery guards a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the lamp over the supplied net part continuously with electricity.
The design of the lamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm hill as a connection, so you can directly connect to your photo stativ.
The tendency should be reliably adjusted by means of mounters on both sides.
It has been taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and therefore are also based on long-life and hard use.
In addition, a disadvantage is included in the volume of delivery.
Gross art is which is also included in the delivery range.
So you can transport or store the lights with all the accessories you may want to buy, without problems safely or safely.
Pain that I have given and she's too small:(
"Party that we wanted to sweep: Frankfurt celebrates after dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Frankfurt entry.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of victorious Hessen were supposed to be on the way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the fruit on a grown seasonal start of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," the trainer Oliver Glasner joyed at DAZN and said a "Pauschal-Lob, to every individual who was with it."
At the beginning, it looked like a new steam for the now on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then, also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also defendant Christopher Lenz, who was able to resist the place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelmed muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a look at the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to make today.
For the future tasks, however, Glasner wants to keep the focus on it, but it is also well set up with regard to the personal situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live high-professional.
Now you want to "step for step and keep modest" and to carry out the tasks until the change in the year" at this level.
Next, on Wednesday in the course of the English week, there is an outdoor game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 o'clock, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake from me.
I've tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect no chance.
Can it be sent directly again to me, or do I have to wait until the money is transferred and resign the order?
Unfortunately, it would mean that I will not be ordered again because it has been very long.
Have you seen them on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damps for handball women before quarterly finals against Spain
After humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women slew with hanging heads and empty views from the parkett.
At the end of the WM headquarters, DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 viewers in Granollers, the DHB selection has to be a defeat and must now be in the quarterly final against the host of Spain.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," condemned Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first settlement in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's bad that we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game of all we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for entering into the semi-finale, a significant increase must be made against the WM-tweet of 2019 on the next Tuesday to keep the deep dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertiser in the duell with the three-fold Olympian Denmark was back-room player Alina Greseels with six gates.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked, "We have to look forward quickly."
Not at the height from the front to the back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the pepper was not high.
Misses and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a fast 0:4-resistant after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was at operating temperature immediately and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate managed the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when greyseels successfully concluded a quick counterpart.
However, the hoped initial inflammation was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in scenes - and if so, they were mostly failing the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of Scandinavia.
So the party had run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially as backspace player Mia Zschocke a little later, because of a hard fool on her counterplayer also saw red.
But in the quarterly final, she may participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-life, the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least at five gates.
After the change, the only quiet hope for a choosing after the change was there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greener guardians sinned in all areas and made it the well-devoted enemy, which counts at the end of the medal candidates, easy to do so.
As a result, the German team could no longer rise to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parkett.

Does that work with them?
The title suggests that I am active as vaccine in mobile vaccine teams, where (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon ready for a large part, it is partly going on in vaccine centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a timely limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are not addressed to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is worried with the vaccination.").
In my task area, the information for vaccination, the indication position (Person has the right to vaccinate according to Corona vaccine regulation and no reason to speak against), the medical documentation and the emergency supply in the case of allergic reactions (mir never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often have no part, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccine, but which can't carry out vaccines (might?), so that I also carry out most vaccines there myself.
Severe "Huidlerer" Question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR television "We in Bayern" has been provided for violent thoughts.
However, different from many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host mi?" this time unfaired by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "who has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV-Moderator, was totally wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus also made it surprising for many upper palaces.
"The Hudler," the observers learned, "is a lap with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialekt researcher Anthony Rowley, consulted by Bayerian television for years as an expert, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typical upper-Palestic term, derived somehow from the more known mouth-type word "Houds".
What an educational gap was closed - probably also with some who have lived in Amberg's room for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always the following error message: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, reconnected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing helped.
Dive selection at the racing wheel- really so pound-safe?
Today morning, I woke up full of acts because I wanted to train at least a little for the preparation of my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done, and I drove with my race wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in so every inner town (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) was running.
Glass splitter on the route.
Zack, loud cushion and my backdrops wanted to join the rest of the line in no more case.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real opportunity to get a replacement mantel and a replacement snake, I had to turn back with half-way bad lone and take the first best train home.
Then it was not very bad, perhaps it's better if I'm again practicing in front of the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm standing in front of a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get very disadvantaged this problem more frequently.
Now wasn't really bad, since even the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, came on the day when I picked the bike off until 14 a.m. 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal because he has been on role with them for more years.
But if I think I have to make a change of tyres while driving to 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly laughtered :D
Now I came into the conversation with an older man at the railroad, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unpluggable.
Now, the whole thing sounds very attractive.
But are they really so uncoverable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/rips now only to be disappointed.
In addition, I ask myself: I have at the moment on the race wheel I think 25x622.
They also exist (like?) in the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you guess me at a race bike in general to other tyres?
The sulphur page seems to be my absolute! Laieviden rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car swallowed against tree: driver deadly hurt
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old was poured up against a central island for unclear reason, and then ratted on the counterway, as the police informed.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then swallowed against a tree and the man was sticked in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old assistant were severely injured and brought into surrounding hospitals.
yes we have deleted all books all bneu authorized and loaded new books

After the publication of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would come back to grow.
SOLO 15 is called the new spray and optically reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal a suitable designed foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This does not affect the acoustic and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the conditions at home.
The principle of the SOLO 15 is very well suitable for people with a more subordinated role, but is intended to reach an exceptional high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate nearly unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and precisely for its size.
Tonal was voted on the SOLO 15 with a light high tone increase.
This is common in broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies significantly increasing bondage.
Exactly focused on the hearing space, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outwards can reduce the high-tonne range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece is in the optimal stereo triangular cord sharp and surprisingly precise.
The relatively suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemydynamic that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but expands them in matters of dissolution and accuracy.
As with all our sets of construction, it is recommended at the beginning to make thoughts about the final optic of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in construction.
For example, to furnish the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier retains material.
After cutting all plates (e.g. in the construction market), you should first bore a 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the corresponding place in order to be able to run the cable easily there later.
With the help of a upper seed, the speaker will now follow the opening in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used in a tie later.
Backside this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker cass as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture “Detail Phase”.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
On these, the back wall, the deck, the front and the ground are now trained.
The three steps should also be used and covered.
The steeps themselves may vary in the material strength if necessary, for example, if you want to use finished performance from the construction market instead of making it itself from 16 mm MDF.
The second page will be applied in the next work step.
Then follow all plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The application of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the clamp on the back wall, will be facilitated by a suitable circle saws or wooden driller.
Afterwards, you will use a circuit lake to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footboard can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footboard is fixedly closured with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and forebuilding (2.5-mm-bows) of the scratch points of the speaker chasis and the connector clamp.
Once the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (blowing out/blowing), the cable is started.
This is the easiest thing through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncursed cable is slided for piece through the 8 mm drilling in the foot to the terminal opening and allows it to stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the opening of the speaker and makes it more locked.
The frequencies are then prepared and used.
The design plan of the frequencies, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Montage instructions Solo 15.
If the frequencies are installed and the connecting terminal is screwed, the density of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is not fully closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with a lot of skill, you can drop hot sticks on the opening and so close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the density accordingly.
Now follow the damping according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be charged to the Pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a matt of the damping material is cut into two parts and is loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be held free.
Can I give up a order now and let it be delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be organizing the OSCAST again this year too!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so that we will pursue the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best, delay or other problems to avoid.
But hey, it's still pandemia – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainable as possible.
> It will go about 0:30.
Have been cold drinks, plant good food and make you ready for a long but very interesting night.
