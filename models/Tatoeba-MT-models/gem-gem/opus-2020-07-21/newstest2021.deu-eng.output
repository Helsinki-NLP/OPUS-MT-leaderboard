Massage: Corona Mass infection: 174 Hardening helpers inflicted
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bay Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must no longer leave the operation.
A security service monitors the procurement.
Totally 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona Erreger Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Dingolfing-Landau Land Council announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we have to go to the protection of the population this step," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
In advance, seven employees had already infected in the operation - this was the cause of the series test.
The operation is a large vegetable farm, which cultivates earthberries, grains, coal and red beet - but only for deposit glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "After our information, it is a closed person circle."
At the court, infected were separated from non-infected employees, the area is now surrounded by a cabin.
Greens and SPDs gave the government responsibility.
The two opposition fractions proposed Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"It can be bitterly revenge when such local infections have to be taken out and ordered regional lockdowns," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This looks very similar to the SPD: "We have already demanded a special control programme for farmers with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Slachthof Mitte May," said the Environmental Expert Florian von Brunn.
"Even the hygiene conditions at work and the living conditions must be controlled sharply from our sight.
This is obviously not happening."
The outbreak had come with announcement.

Report: Seehofer urges longer stock data storage
The stock data storage is currently exposed.
However, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extension of stock records, instead of the planned ten weeks, a half year after a media report.

Söder expresses itself on mass infection to Corona-Lage
Munich - Minister for Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a teamaterialsive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our website.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, more than one third has infected with the Corona arrogant.
The court is now under quarantine and is locked up with a building tail.
Nobody must leave the area, food is delivered.
The well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the country council is still assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Science bites": consciousness of Nantes' disguised firemaker
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the consciousness was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "powered by conscience and taken very much from the extent of the destruction".
In the case of a condemnation, the man threatens, according to the lawyer, ten years of prison and a penalty of EUR 150.000.
The Gothic Sankt Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged at a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire was broke out in the church at three far away places.
Laboratory studies harmed the suspicion of fire stationation.
The now arrested suspect had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But he was released again after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral in the evening before the fire.
Since there was no trace for a violent entrance into the church, he rushed quickly into the field of the investigators.
Discuss about the removal of the 50+1 rules
The former president of the DFB Reinhard Grindel recommended to consider the removal of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss the conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "Image on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become dangerous at the eastern Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkus.
In this respect, we do not come around the debate, whether it is not required to interrupt associations who want to break into this phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he doubts whether in the German football League there is the willingness to allow majority participations that are prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Federal League.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment zones in a European internal market to the Federal Economic Site," said Grindel.
The former DFB-Chef sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more excitement in mastership".
Even a equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a sale of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"There have been people who noticed this error and went through to the press instead of talking to me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I have already been very busy in human life."
The gift in the value of around 1,000 euros he had received from an Ukrainian functional.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the uminous watch gift, I have handled completely transparent and indignant.
There were many in the DFB who knew about it."
He never made "a hole from the gift," insured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects the rejection of the creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible but also injustice," said one opinion.
"When 50 percent of the children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer durable under the current conditions.
Consequently, Argentina calls for its private believers to waive a part of their claims of about 66 billion US dollars (approximately EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state place.
It would be the ninth payout in the Argentinan history.
Lastly, the creditors had requested higher interest rates on State bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government holds its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not complied with interest rate requirements of 503 million US dollars and thus had been charged to a limited payment loss.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It's running super good" - this fazit moves Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: In the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will enter the follow-up of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Even six weeks later, early July, the promovated lawyer took up the work, the normal day business is running long on full tours.
"I still have to come to private," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short past time has not been sufficient to transfer the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the fertile dingofingerin.
At present, she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband who is working in Regensburg as a judge at the courtyard.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental time in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to get out of pendles from Regensburg every day, she may even have a nighting possibility with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Adults in the neighborhood, her city of Eggenfelden, of course, has long been a concept.
On visits on the site with her family in the past months, she recently found: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
It has been much more pleased that in the selection procedure, she has made the race around the free place.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's occupational arrival, her home Niederbayern plays a key role: After the Jura Study in Passau, she took her referendum and the second state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessorin, including Rehau and Hof in Upper Franken, Babenhausen im Unterallguu and Regensburg - at this time she also trained "nebenbei" the promotion in labour law - she entered her first place in 2012 as a notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district Passau.
In 2016, she went to parent, and finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representation services in various Notariats.
When the post had been awarded in Eggenfelden due to the nearest retirement of Lutz Feller, it has seen the right time for the full recruitment, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation at the Notariat station, has accepted Dr. Stefanie Kramer fully - and has likewise prepared a praise for the office team: "It's running super good!"
The fact that she can rely on records here makes it easier for her to take care of the ongoing transfer of the private food point.
In the case of children's gardens and cripples, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to meet the most beautiful jogging lines of the Rottal.
BVB plants for league start with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football city in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the seasonal start in the case of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regime that is forced to comply, we are planning at present with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmunds Manager Carsten Cramer, "day level".
Usually, the Arena in the district city at Bundesliga games has some more than 81,000 viewers.
In the last season's spirit games caused by the Corona pandemia, the BVB per batch had lost about four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation by the BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal viewers places, some of the approximately 4000 places in the Hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a stroke to the office when these revenues are completely broken away."
In view of the persistent Corona Crisis, all are currently "good to take a stable side long for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing-Chef praised the BVB-Profie for their salary part-off, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "At the same time, the players know that their pay-off has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."

They are so small and so early born that neither lungs nor darm nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear pup clothes and specially made mini-winners.
But not so small that they wouldn't be at voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger humiliates.
"Of they're not as loud as big babies."

Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig sheet" in view of the FDP and does not change anything on the nature of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP-Innenpolitiker Benjamin Strasser of the News Agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal District Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided by a majority in May on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation.
Kalbitz is Chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landdag.
"If the AfD really was about to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries such as Björn Höckes and its trailers were long been excluded," said Strasser.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded is not saying anything and doesn't change anything," he said the "Welt on Sunday".
"It rather speaks bands, how many frenetic supporters still have a legal extremer in the middle of the AfD."
Blossom is expected that the AfD will fall under five percent in the future of elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the words of the officially dissolved "Flügels" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes- und Fraktionspräsident Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection represents the staring as "safe right-extremist pursuit".
In May, the AfD Federal Foreign of Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate a former membership of the legal extreme "Himately German Youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans at its entrance.
Kalbitz confronts the membership of the HDJ.
The chairman of the left fraction at Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesscheidgericht does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten creide.
The AfD remains a right-extreme party, whether with or without calbitz."
With this decision, neither the federal party nor the right wings are weakened.
"The manöver of the mauthen trap is transparent.
You want to escape a further observation through the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not get the spirits she called.
There is no change in a robbery," the Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Hier the AfD Landing Association and the Group held their right leader until today."
The legal conflict about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he would now act against the decision of the Federal Court of Auditors.
North Sea-Windparks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 the wind power stations at the German North Sea have eaten electricity into the network.
These are about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator informed tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea stream to the Festland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have eaten another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
Overall, the wind flow from North and East Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
This means that the wind cultivation at sea represents nearly 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of the offshore wind energy comes from higher production capacity in addition to the wind conditions, because in the last 12 months new wind parks have gone to the network.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea all run with full power, they could generate 6.7 Gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is based on the tennet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
In the German North Sea, it is to rise to 17 Gigawatt by 2030.
"In Germany and in the Netherlands, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network bindings," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not use their capacity on lake, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is 2 January when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six Gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.

In the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" took part.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled for Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30.000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in the sense of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute," said Oberburgermeister Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But at last we are here as an organizer for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands were flown into the mainland and the festival, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a people's festival wouldn't have left much.
In addition, organisational and monitoring efforts would increase unreasonably by a multiple.
Rumberg comforted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Recently more flight slots in worms
The worms university continues to go into the ventilation: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" sets up a professional for "Air Traffic Management".
A similar contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first completed for three years and started in 2021.
The professor has the opportunity to allow the study start not only in summer but also for winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as yet.
At the same time, capacity is equally exhausted both at the university and at the DFS Air Safety Academy.
The DFS will consult the university in the establishment and occupation of the professor.
Since 2019 at the university
Since summer summer 2019, the first students in their training for flying lots at the University of Worms are at the Air Traffic Management course.
In this year, nine students started.
Until now, the experiences of DFS are very positive, the performances of students are excellent.
The combination of study and lots training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the lotsing profession.
"In these times the promotion is not economically easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to be recovered and to grow on a long-term basis.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal task in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professor is a future-safe investment that will provide a wide, technically cross-border knowledge base to airlines for the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the university and support our attractiveness as employer at the same time."
This also emphasizes Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The foundation professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it, we want to connect to the existing cooperation with the DFS German air navigation as a practice partner for double Bachelor studies Air Traffic Management".
The trust of German air navigation is for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further strengthen their learning and research skills in the future areas of air traffic.
In the use of tomorrow's flight slots, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual study can set very special highlights and innovative focuss for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has a single setting feature in Rhineland-Pfalz.
The current signing of the cooperation contract strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue screws land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the motorway A 45 was fully locked on Saturday afternoon to Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident of the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old ride straight in the curve with a ford at 12.40 p.m. at the exit of Alzenau-midt and landed on the guide plank.
The frontair bags were triggered, the driver suffered light injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old assistant were cared by the emergency doctor and the patient fled into a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, where a damage of about EUR 2000 was caused, had to be dropped.
Healing wants to examine other industries for the meat industry
The Corona crisis re-explained the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative distortions are shortly in place.
But are they right - and will it stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour of Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict rules currently planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employer already warns about limiting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the flesh giant Tönnies in Nordrhein-Westfalen, the Federal Cabinet will decide a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Great slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, destruction and meat processing.
The use of contractors and employees is to be prohibited.
Ingo Kramer, President of the employer, said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee transfer, if you do not want to completely dismiss the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for wide areas of craft, construction and construction, the basis for their value creation in customers.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
"My goal is not to prohibit works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If a industrial company has the duty of a craftsman to build a security facility, this is a very normal working contract."
The German flesh economy considers a prohibition of works contracts and leasing work alone in its industry to be constitutional.
It is not explainable why the portionation and packaging of cheese should apply to other labour laws than to worst in the future, says in an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saterday).
Consumer price would therefore increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product in the case of a ban.
Many Eastern European employees from work contract firms worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration, partly 16 hours a day.
They often had no break.
Lohn was reserved for protective equipment or rental.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that for the flesh industry a relatively sharp law had already entered into force in 2017.
However, "threesome constructions" have managed them.
"Now it is necessary to clear up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act that we want to decide in the Cabinet at the end of July, measures which are not only related to the meat sector, such as higher test rates for the protection of work or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The present draft includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers' rights in the meat economy and the labour law.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could make more checks in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the "Brandenburg current" RBB-sendment.
However, for more controls, more staff are also needed.
Three dead at the crash of Ultraleichtflugzeug in Germany
On the crash of an Ultraleicht Airplane to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, three people have died according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been saved in the accident, said a speaker of the circuit leader Wesel.
A fall screen was found at the accident site, so the police.
The "Rhine Post" reported, under the call of eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane was collapsed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
More details were not known at first.
Rome of Frankfurt Opernplatz has passed peacefully
One week after the excursions in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera site in the night has also gone peacefully on Sunday.
Finally, some dozens of people remained in the place, but left him before the start of the locking hour at 1 o'clock.
The police have been in service with numerous officials since the early evening, a larger police command was to see throughout the city area.
The first time this weekend from midnight was a ban on deception for the opera site, where it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked from the amount of celebrations with bottles.
At least five officials were injured after police intakes, damaged several police vehicles.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar severely hurt
In an accident between Schöneberg and Humme, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the Clinicum Kassel.
With heat cameras, the firearm searched for possible coachs.
The woman, according to police on the Bundesstraße 83, was on the way to her place of residence, when her car came from unclear cause of the road and crossed several times.
In order to save the misleading, the fire guard had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was elected from the rotator with a heat camera.
The Drohnentaffel from Warburg, which also works with heat cameras, was also ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high maize plants.
The injured one was brought to further supply with the rescue car to the Kasseler Klinikum.
Almost 50 forces of fire warfare Hofgeismar, Hummer and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a resolving gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has for the ninth time in series secured the Italian mastership.
The team around the five-fold world footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of the United Nations History perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which, without the last long damaged ex-national player Sami Khedira, did not expel two days before the end of the season of series A.
The second table of Inter Milan is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half of the time, and then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic revaluated the 35-year-old from the penalty border directly with a flat-shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This was the shinless but decisive success.
The foul meter shot on the Latte in the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself should have sworn correctly with the view of the gatekeeper valuation.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the moment changes very easily," explained trainer Mauricio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinee Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual fatigue of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the mastership perfect.
At the end of the calm procurement at the table peak, Juve had finally to blame for the weakness of competitors.
For in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri manship had only succeeded five victories.
Whether Ronaldo becomes torhead king, it is questionable.
Because during the Portuguese Superstar hit 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome in Greece Verona has already 34 meetings on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title gain of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the present Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, for the "old lady" of the Italian football, the next title chance is waiting.
Juventus stands in the eight-finale of the Champions League, however, on 7 August against Olympique Lyon must compete a 0:1-shinspielplatz in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. Round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as a opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal autoruns included
Stuttgart - All threatened punishments and judicial judgments despite giving car drivers in countless illegal races on the bath-württemberg streets continue gas: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparison values for the years before are not available, but the razors are increasingly working to the judicial authorities: in the state lawyers between Constanz and Mannheim, 155 investigation procedures were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until June 151.
The races were less organised events, such as the interior Ministry's response to a request from the country-day SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were suddenly interrupted or they had taken the escape from the police - it is also indicated as an illegal race.
In particular, German men from 18 to 60 years of age sat at tax.
113 Penalties - 15 times prison
Only in relatively few cases the breeders are captured and also asked for the box: According to the Ministry of Inn, 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 punishments of freedom have been expressed.
However, there are no points that the number of illegal autoruns actually increase.
Instead, other drivers reacted more sensitively because of several tragic accidents and processes in the past years and showed more frequently, one ministerial speaker said.
Especially popular in Rasern is the motorway 8. Recurrently, drivers brake the traffic out there to provide space and use the free route for a race.
In August last, a dozen driver was found near Kirchheim under Tech, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 in Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "line"
At the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal motorway.
A tempolite is trying to brake out the razzia on the particularly affected section between dews and geisingen.
The most high-powered and busy sports and luxury crusts often have Swiss marks, because the drivers are avoiding racing to Germany because of the high punishments for fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the Tempolitan should not reduce to a few routes: "With a general tempolite of 130 hours kilometres, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport experts of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The inhibitor threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not supposed to be legal at 200 miles and more on the road here and there."
Rivoir thinks less of information or image campaigns: "Who, in such a way, moves over all rules and not only puts his own lives, but also the life of other traffic participants, is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for a stronger interference with the police
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be absurd from the temporal limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Department of Transport and the Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and more harder controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely, from the high-turn force measurement, painful and following severe seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died across the country in the races, of which two unparticipated in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's Innenstadt and one in Gerlingen.
There are two young men who should have delivered a car race in November.
One of the cars came from the street, pruned against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old bike died.
21 more people were hurt in the races of the last two years.
However, sharp punishment is not necessary by Minister of Inner Ministers Thomas Strobl: "It is not seen in the paper of the Ministry of Interior, that lawgivers need to heal illegal carriage.

Nürnberg: Unauthorised Tuning-Treffen - Police attacks, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated in a "Tuning-Treffen" on the parking space of a furniture house.
The police turned their announcement to reinforce the control of such events.
A large Tuning-Treffen came to Nürnberger Südstadt on Saturday night (25 July 2020).
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.

Illegale Tuning Treffen in Nürnberg: Only a small part from the "scenario"
The officials counted at the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police accounted for.
However, there is only a small proportion of those present in the Autoposer and Tunings scenes.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene came to the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons in place, it should be assumed that this was mainly actuators.
In addition, the main proportion of those present remained in the existing provisions of protection of infection, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the duration of a mouth nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the site were terminated at 1:00 p.m.
As a whole, officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had been released.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No autorun
Illegal autorun didn't give it.
"The police presidency of Central France will continue to look at the events and continue to carry out increased control measures, including in the context of the emergence of actors," it said.
The Agency News5 said to Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved shipping company: "They have all beautiful fields that we must not declare," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Even because the cars are broader, the company must be careful not to make any damage.
"The young people are supposed to keep their cars uninjured."
Numbers of the Agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Work (BA) is based on its own statement on approximately 900 suspects of abuse of short-working money.
"It is extremely little for more than 80,000 companies who have shown short work," said the Executive Board responsible for the Operational Business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually, the test will last up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available for us in this hot phase.
That's more precisely, we'll look at the final accounts.
I'm sure it's going to be a little more.
We are not naive there and we have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
The BA analysis software also uses to identify misuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency cell in the autumn.
"Would there be much more insolvencies than in the previous year?
Assessments are different, but we are now awaiting the case and training our employees in the work agencies for editing applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inclined, said Terzenbach.

The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Massentests after Corona outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular unroasterly tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism operations, but at least one holiday guest was positively tested.
Inhabitants, guests and tourism employees were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The locking time was set at 23 o'clock.

The tourism association launched an information campaign to sensitize young employees for the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidays and residents were tested.

Aston Villa decided the Fernuelle with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for itself, but at West Ham United had to climb around the class content for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) matched Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) did, however, because Watford lost at 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.

arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
The protests in Israel against government head Netanjahus are increasingly stronger.
In the night, violent conflicts have come.
The Israeli police were violent in Jerusalem in the night to Sunday against participants of a demonstration against the right conservative governor Benjamin Netanjahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participation in disruption, police speakers Micky Rosenfeld informed.
The police used water guards, among other things, to dissolve the complaint.
Overall, after media reports on Saturday evening, about 6000 people were gathered near Netanjahus Offices' seat.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protestants smote drums, bleeded in horns and called Netanjahu to resign.
The news page "ynet" reported that participants were also arrested in an anti-demonstration that supported Netanjahu.
In many other places in Israel people also demonstrated, including before the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested according to police statements near Tel Aviv because it is suspicious to have sprayed from a riding car of pepper spray on demonstrators at the edge of the street.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstration in the south of the country.
The demonstrant had easily been hurt at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been multiple demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The complaints accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Lastly, Netanjahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona Crisis.
It is maintained, among other things, pre-accelerated locks and lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hardly added the country's economy.
Unemployment rates were at last more than 20 percent.
The number of re-infections with the Corona virus in Israel was finally risen to ever new record values.

North Korea rubbles border town after Corona suspected
North Korea has hitherto seen a "liquid success" in its own measures to protect Coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country reports a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely declined a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been swallowed into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, there was an emergency.
The Communist leader called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the defeated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and has described its defence as "liquid success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reported by a "extroverter" who illegally crossed the military demarkation line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
The person left to South Korea three years ago and had now returned to the border.
For border crossing within the four kilometres wide and mostly minor military buffer zones, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
South Korean military however, according to reports from the National News Agency Yonhap, the possibility of an illegal cross-border to North Korea as high.
Some individuals were investigated.
North Korea, according to its own information on Saturday because of the suspicion, an urgent meeting of the Labour Party's Police Office under the chair of powerholder Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster."
Kim has already ordered as a preventive measure on Friday, "to block Kaesong completely and to isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had their contact, had been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore intended to examine the "excruption" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300 000 people live in Caesong.
Expensation before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still faced with a large summer break for discussion
"Now environmental themes, the members of the Board will also vote on the construction plan for the major project Innenstadt Development-Ost," it is rather accomplishable in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. at the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, especially the upgrading of the eastern city will be discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of these are slightly rejecting, at least in individual committees, depending on presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then by the administration and the municipal council, now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project maker Reinhard Klein as "external parliamentary opposition", "unsensitive", "speculation", "unglempment" and "conscious false statements".
"All believe to know it better," said Klein, who has belonged to the Municipal Council for a year as the only representative of the Citizen List of Pforzheim.
Actually, after reading of the contracts in this position, he is: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper to the city that the technical council is contrary to the statements of the city administration by grants whose existence is small to clean for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than it is predicted in the Council's house and on the side of the promoters from the economy.
To make the City by its own power and not an investor: It was its plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also refuses the project, presented an alternative concept.
In general, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council Hall, the opening of the castle, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a smaller interior transformation in ideal cases with local carriers.
Environmental topics play a key role
In addition, particularly environmental issues will play a key role.
The municipality council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise burdens caused by road traffic, including frequencies.
In a press release, the current traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of tempo 30. The political officers in the city are not innocent to the fact that this must be so because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus to the noise by negligence of line bus traffic with diluted tacts and by little commitment to bicycle traffic, says the VCD.
The municipality council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, on the agenda of the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the country Baden-Württemberg, the re-fixing of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for inclusion in the Smart City Support of the Federal.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona protection measures must be implemented.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts on July 31 in his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters.
Before the League of the supersport car can take the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann it was mainly about to meet his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.

This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.

"There are a few things that are different from porch from the front season," says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really has made a lot of fun."
Roommann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years, the Netherlands has been experienced in the GT-Sport and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motor sport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand blending and we also made huge progress at the Lausitzring from Session to Session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31, the 33 supersport cars will run through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, one of 15 serial nebulisers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last guest in the motodrome.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used little to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafens Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many quick passages that you need to meet optimally to be quick."
How fast the roomman is then, that shows itself in two weeks.
"The teams of course poker at the tests a little," he said.
"To the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the entrance of a thickly pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
At the moment, there is a prominent guest.
In the mid-August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formula-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantäne Decision Coldly captured
The decision of the British Government to put Spain leavers under quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, coldly captured the country's transport minister.
Thus, Grant Shapps is currently in vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the growing Corona counts in Spain, the cabinet in London stretched the country from the list of countries from which no quarantine charges are available.

Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"A number of ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility for a quarantine to be adjacent to holidayfarers in Spain," commented Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But, apparently, no one has been trying to say Grant Shapp's statement."
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona note in Spain and the expiry of the stringent starting blocks, the numbers of infections in the country increase again.
Virologists are particularly responsible for the recent spread.
Spain is one of the most favourite holiday countries of the British.
From unnecessary travels to the Spanish Festival, the British Government is currently advised, which are excluded from the Canaries and Balearians especially popular for British holidays.
More than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the new corona virus and more than 28,000 dead.

Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM titles.
All American races were dismissed.
Racing calendar becomes more and more concrete

Over the week, the Grand Prix, which has been confirmed, added three further races.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portuguese are to be driven.

Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Lassight show by Stephen Colbert by a video scale and deceived in the interview, which she had in her meeting with Donald Trump.

She told us, among other things, about her fight against the mighty people of the world.
Also about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - In the last two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made her unleashed use for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known Letight show, she spoke about her plans in the future and her meeting with the U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Letight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your shipment and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the mighty people of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to control the focus from the climate crisis," she shocked.
"Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children go on the road," she experienced.
Heads of State and leadership politicians who spook against them in social media or even try to put them to silence, she finds 'pleasant' as you show the reactions, 'as they have no other answer to it'.
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw U.S. president Trump a bitter bad look afterwards.
At the UN Climate Summit of 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a trailing journey: after a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steadily down and then slowly back up.
Now the Bluesrock gitarrist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult attacher: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
At the age of 73 he died peacefully in the sleep, family members informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in a emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
The battlemaker Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-term legendary band in 1967 in London until today his dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") was similar to a trailer.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success but then without him.
There should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the winnings of the group for pleasant purposes.
He began to appear in wide clothes and with great cruisefix.
Also psychic problems should have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock gitarrist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as reported by biographers.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatrie.
During a large part of the 1970s, musicians disappeared from the picture area.
He is supposed to live on the road at time, as a farm gardener and have spent for a while in a Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In young years, he enthusiasticed himself for US blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15 the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later the chance of standing on the stage as a Lead Guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A few later he was committed to his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers as a replacement.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreaker colleague Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green was the first number 1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media room, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 surprisingly achieved an eighthful success with a album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swims there without him in a new formation on a success wave.
Your album "Romaours" appeared in 1977 sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo results, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he restarted with a group of friends musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues leg in life - and with his soft sound one of the most impressive guitarists in the past decades.
