Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear interference with the Muppets
In some Members of the National Assembly, the proposal to amend their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is disturbing.
This is why plans are to change the name of the National Assembly to the "Welsh Parliament" (Walisian Parliament).
National Assembly Members of all political directions are afraid to become the goal of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name is “with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Valsian readers: In the Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national parliamentary member of the Party Plaid Cymru indicated that the whole group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was unlocked against the change in name, but pointed to the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the valley letter w is similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which currently constructs a law on the change in names, said: “The final decision on names for the national meeting members is, of course, with the members themselves.”
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorized the Wallic National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Board “Welsh Parliament Members” (Walisian Parliament Members) or “WMPs” preferred, while the option “MWP” was the largest support in a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the ringing for a consensus for the chairman of Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of national meeting members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referral of the people was appointed to bring about a decades of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been on the fact that the name of his northern neighbors means that this right is raised to the Greek territory and has repeatedly spoken against its entering into the EU and the NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the national vote on the change of name, said that he will not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and the NATO is.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke with said, in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"There are not both today."
He said that the disappearance of the bars is feasible.
“The social life of people looks different today," he said.
“But are no longer the neighborhood's living rooms where people are regularly finding in."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will be at the beginning before or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments in which people who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of the people who buy property in these buildings will be whites,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these property apartments will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropole: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original white methodist community was excreting.
A black congregation that held their worship nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who directed a boycott by retailers in the 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the father of Johnson’s commune members planned the reconstruction, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who spoke of the bell game in July, used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "a immense historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, which had changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been attracted partly by the leaders of the church and partly by the Bishop diocese.
In July, the Head of Municipality – the leadership of the municipality – expressed written concerns to the Diocese that the diocese would try to transfer the costs to the municipal board, although it was not involved in the mandate of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some municipal members complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai hurts in Californien 13-year-olds due to praise
According to official statements, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster Season, a throat attacked a 13-year-old boy in the duck to Lobster.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's help cry and with several others paddled to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was glad to have caught a praise, but then he realized that the boy shouted “I’ve been bited!
I've been bited!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg was shaken.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a hai in the water!’, added Hammel.
The boy was fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The kind of hatred responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a few weeks before had been seen a hai in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous haiart.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
For investigation purposes and for safety reasons, officials locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetics that are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
In the context of a large-scale predecession of the 2.8 billion British pounds of cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and budget records are reduced, the larger cosmetics divisions are tested in 11 branches across the country. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics is combined with the search of the supermarkets for opportunities to use shops used for television, microwave equipment and household goods in advance.
According to Sainsbury's, the range of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket takes a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique” so that most of the products are veganian-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's film sites. The first sales station was opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small amounts of food in local demand article business means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales stations are increasingly looking like buying houses, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against the discounter Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food articles.
Sainsbury's has been set up in hundreds of branches of Argos sales and a number of habitats since the purchase of the chains Argos and Habitat chains for two years ago. This has increased food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a discussion on the distribution of revenue from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as in four branches an extended range of luxury-maintensive brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy will be added.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics divisions to create an attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is cut to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the cheap locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchase, which questions the former kind of purchase."
Peter Jones “worn” after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from a business value of 11 million UK pounds
“Dragons’ Den” Star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV-Moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business of 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle marking company in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” engineer, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby injured “Dragons” The” Star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brands to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones should have been “angry” when the “Golden Girl” of the television was given, on a voluntary meeting on Tuesday in the central of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to their new businesses – in value of up to 1.5 million UK pounds – of the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal of Truly at Instagram, Jones Great Britain left on the way to one of his holidays.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should ensure its future for them over the next decades.
Their decision for withdrawal was totally surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as soon as before the introduction of the market.
In the centre of Marlow, a store house of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” Moderator, which is one of the most promising Stars of Great Britain, could cost millions due to high investment in products from cushion and candles to clothes and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, came as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is intended to become a trademark messenger for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a moderator of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones nearby source said yesterday evening: “We don't comment on his business issues.”
Hard words “and then we have loved ourselves”
He shouted about the criticism that he was expecting from the news media for a comment that some would view as "non-president" and for so positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said the voice of a newsmoderator following:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a great step towards Denuklearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuklearisation negotiations have been made in stocks.
Over three months after the summit in June in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the highest diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leaders from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the north is not a "compliant reaction" of the United States on North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States was attached to sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump proved much more optimistic in his advertising speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We stood before a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, support in the release of hostels and return of the deadly survivors of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of speaking about the relationship with Kim.
“It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 100,000 people who stand outside and try to get into this overfilled arena, there would be about 200 people here,” said Trump and pointed to the human crowd right before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were said that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population were distributed, no national emergency was explained, a condition for mobilising international assistance.
“In many cases they have made very clear that they do not require international support, so that is something difficult," said Sumbing.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, speaker of the disaster protection authority, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu after whether international bodies were supposed to participate in the aid measures.
Given the shaking of the earth with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still badly prepared for natural violence.
While in Aceh Tsunami protection accommodations were built, they are not everyday sight on other coastal stripes.
The Tsunami warnsirene in Palu seemed to have contributed to the deaths despite a warning in force.
Tours between Indonesia’s many islands are already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but the place of the new disaster will be reached in three days at first.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the attacked Indonesian infrastructure a core part of his electoral campaign and has used plenty of money for roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko to re-elect the next year is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confession voltages in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practise a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and ten thousands were displaced from their houses and apartments when bands of Christians and Muslims were fighting on the streets with Macheter, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.

The Cromwell State before Parliament will be the newest monument of the dispute about rewriting the history
Their ban would be poetic justice for its destruction to the Taliban so many cultural and religious art products of England through its fanatic puritanic followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "toorness" and "a attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the picture of Oliver Cromwell was the goal of the Westminster Palace.
The picturestorm in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful presentation of Cromwell is a proof of the view and part of the history description of a figure that is still worth celebrating in the 19th century.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today as someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case, of course through the monarchy.
Whether it is a totally appropriate representation, the subject of continued history debates is.
Surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizeable figure that represents a side of this climb.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killing pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man named "Yuan" only was discovered with a divorced species of blood flow near a pigestall on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to inject pig vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighbouring swine was open.
He said there was a great male pig with blood on the snause.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg heavy pig had deadly prayed to the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and stumbled," the cousin, named the aftername "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recording a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News that the pig had been locked in order to prevent attacks on other people, while the police collected evidence at the Tatort.
Yuans family and market authorities negotiate reports on a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kg heavy pig climbed a whale farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could evacuate the animal.
After a farmer was frozen in Oregon from his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “exploitant”.
“They're only misspelled.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they're not trying to hurt someone.
You just need to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rains in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa is weakened on the way over the colder water at the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring overflows of rainfall in North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock eastern coastal time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a orcharican of category 1, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa moves north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to form a troop over the Pacific, which moves to the west coast of the United States towards the east. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of rainfall.
Then the tropical moisture in the coming days generates widespread defeat in the southwest by interactions with the tragedy.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluthy floods, in water driven shots and possibly harvest in the desert.
High tropical moisture leads to defeat rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centuries per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical defeat, there is the possibility of flute floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical defeat, it is urgently advised to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause Canyons to be broken streams, and threads bring local windbows as well as wind that leads dust.
The nearby trog brings strong rains to parts of the southern California coast.
It may be possible that total drops of more than a centimeter which can lead to low levels of water-driving shots and smooth bicycles.
This would be the first precipitation of the rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and stays over Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, since the Arctic is cooling down while the tropes remain relatively hot.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm October beginning with wide-spread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast is expected.
New York City could reach Tuesday 27 oC, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million viewers have seen the fascinating statements of the Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Patt situation stopped. The television broadcasters interrupted their regular program on Friday because of a turn in the last minute: a agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, resulting in an unscheduled investigation of charges by the FBI.
Ford told the Senate justice committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average numbers of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had been broadcasting the hearing, the figures were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewers numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This corresponds to about the number of viewers in a play-off football game or in the Oscar transfer.
The broadcaster Fox News Channel, whose intent-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, reported Nielsen with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the whole day hearing the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came to the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reported by Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras, as protesting him in the wheelchair on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood for minutes with a lowered view while he was trained. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm standing right here before you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he says the truth to the country?"
“You have power while so many women are powerless," said a woman.
Flake said that his office published an explanation and supplemented before the wheelchair closed that he would have to say more in the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later when the Jurisdiction Committee was to vote on the continuation of the Nomination of Kavanaughs for the vote to the Senate.
Flake, however, said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demands the accusations against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by conversation with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, since it was evident that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has led to an FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics to use the Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for the release from the European Union to use the future of Great Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet on 29 September 2018 on the day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In a other interview published on the title page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified its attack on her so-called "Chequers plan" for the Brexit by calling a proposal for the mutual inclusion of customs duties by the United Kingdom and the EU as "full absurd".

Vulcan's ashes on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the Vulcan Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and was registered within 24 hours 183 outlets of gas and ashes.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of Grollen and shocking.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, a earthquake of starch has shaken 7.1 central Mexico, geophysics have established increased activity at the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collisions between the willing police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the Polarising Independent Referent in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-Separatists, held by the willingness police, washed them with eggs and swallowed colour powders, so that dark dust clouds were generated in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the next day it also came to hand joints with the police who used their struggles to hamper the battle.
For several hours, pro-independence groups “No forget, forgiveness” were scanned, while Unionists called “Long Life of Spain”.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for smaller infringements in protests.
However, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid has seen as illegal, celebrated by separateist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The voters had decided with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the electoral participation was low, since the voters were mostly boycotted.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-independence groups had struggled on Friday over night to prevent demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“We have experienced one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they were able to choose, but now we hang firm," he said.
Despite an important, if also buttons, victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties had difficulties in maintaining the turn of this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in the exile or in prison, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been crushed by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more stressed," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junquera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the election of Europe, the best way is to encourage the decreasing of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish Government," he said.

Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0-winning about Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved crucial to Gary Holt's team in the second half of the season with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains in this season without outward victory in the premiership and is faced with the heart of the next Sunday, which is back to eight points.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers in Europe League are hosts for Rapid Vienna.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, i.e., Chieftrainer Holt has not yet been defeated since his acquisition by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against voluntary guests
Holt's team had to be in the lead for a long time before the meeting, as his direction the Rangers faced the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down before the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was hit to meet Craig Halkett's headhead on the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play before themselves, as they knew that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came.
The Rangers allowed a loose hit, and Livingston prepared a chance that Declan Gallagher and Robinson brought Menga in a shooting position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained widely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers Torhüter Allan McGregor with the feet, and Lithgow swing the ball out of another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks came to the violation room of Livingston and were regularly brought out of the area of danger, while two demanded criminal offences – one of the Halketts against the exchanged Glenn Middleton and one for hands were refused.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have overcome the expectations of this upward trend again.
Their games and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt has given great praise for the way he has waking the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organized defense while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on trab during the whole game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at time they were under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient – only once they could blow through the crew of the hosts – and this is something like a wake call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue heavens dominated when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair the relations between the NATOs.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and access to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police named safety reasons for a 25,000 people who refused to gather themselves in front of the mosque. However, many attendants found themselves near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurden – also heard. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German dryers as hero and is smoked by other than autocrate.

In October last year, officers were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the staff with pool balls were attacked.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluid floods (doring areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen in the beginning of the next week when the rest of Hurrikan Rosa moves across the deserts and brings the risk of flute floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings from flutty floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada and southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches rain on Monday evening and moves directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix announced in a Tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix to 320 miles [320 km]!
Katrina (1967) was a orcharican within 64 kilometres from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with up to 15 centuries in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the wilderness, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimeters and combined as a whole up to 10 centimeters.
For those in which there is no risk of fluid floods, the downturns associated with Rosa due to dry in the region may be a blessing.
Although floods are very worried, this rain is likely to be useful in some cases, as in the southwest, dry is currently prevailing.
According to the U.S. Drygt Monitor, in some more than 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drying, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
First, the path of the Hurrikan means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will have a maximum of 136 kilometres per hour and will be 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the Hurrikan will move to the north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Consequently, Rosa is expected to land on Montagnach afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The precipitations may be significant in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant flood risk.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfall sums are expected from 7.5 to 15 centuries, with up to 25 centimeters possible," reported weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will move as a tropical storm across Mexico in northern direction, reach the border to Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression and then to the late Tuesday night through Arizona to the south of Utah.
“The main danger is expected in connection with Rosa or its remains to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these defeats, the desert is expected to have a life-threatening fluthy flooding and water-driving shots, as well as in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the finding of a 16-year-old with sting wounds in Somerset, three boys were arrested in the teenage age and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the wheelstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the common unit, the anger of the Democrats.”
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unreasonable and unhearred techniques of Democrats," said Trump at a contest in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the common unit, the anger” of the Democrats during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the convention and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he had sexually troubled them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also expressed its accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday, the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance sheet in the service of generality," he said the amount of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
I don't approach, but in reality I'm approaching," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission "to make and block resistance".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high employee of the GOP's leadership against CNN.
Hundreds of earthquakes killed in Indonesia, sacrifices increase
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swept away as due to a strong earthquake and a Tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi gigantic waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival at the beach of the city of Palu, when the darkness fell up to six meters high waves on the beach, rising many people into death and destroying everything that was in their way.
The Tsunami had preceded a earthquake of the strength 7.5.
“When yesterday the threat of the Tsunami came up, people still went to the beach and did not run out of it immediately, and they fell him as a victim," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian disaster protection authority GDPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The Tsunami did not come alone, he swimed cars, tree tribes and houses, he met all of the land," said Nugroho. He added that the Tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met on the coast.
Some people were climbed on trees and survived, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centuries in Palu.
Air records published by the disaster protection authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and stores, verbose and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further descendants.
The earthquake series was found in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agent for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that energy released during the massive creature of the Friday has dealt with the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb cast on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the situation of the city at the end of a long, narrow bucket, the Tsunami could have grown, the Authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “refining” and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his statement, the bodies of some victims were found among the broken buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damages could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area named Donggala, closer to the epidemic centre of the bivalve.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, and there was no information.
According to a Declaration of the Red Cross, there are more than 300 000 people there, and his employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse," said the explanation.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticised that it had not informed that a Tsunami Palu had met, although the waves were officially encountered at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building, who desperately warns the people on the road under him from the nearby Tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall drives on the beach and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Through the quake and the Tsunami, there was a massive power loss that interrupted the communication around Palu and harmed the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuates still need food and other vital goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and was opened for aid only.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in Evacuation Centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of the World Vision from Donggla have reached the city of Palu, where the employees are in tent accommodations in their offices, safely, but, according to the words of Dosebas, came over on scenes of devastatement.
“They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the assistants with the hard task began to initiate the catastrophe aid, some of them agreed that experts in foreign countries would be obliged to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, delivery and staff from abroad will only be possible if the place of an accident has been declared to the national disaster area.
This has not happened until now.
“On the moment it is another disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status does not apply until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the Tsunami of Friday dropped over Palu, friends and family members of those still missed on one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, a woman freed rescue forces, which had been clamped in under treads for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel, as Mandagi supplemented, were his students.
"As a senior at the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us how he was going in the hours after the message of the entrance of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliders, whatsApp messages are desperately sent to the contest participants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led to blue cocks only to gray question marks instead.
"I think that means that the news were not sent," he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The being officially known as Canye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change predicts his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the consignment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has rejected for “emotional reasons”.
The word is not just a shortening of his current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West according to its own statement.
“I believe that ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radiomoderator Big Boy.
"I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Canye, which means “the only” only “Ye” – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects rather what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which West worked earlier, has already written his name with and without binding and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO promised not to take the military against civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to apply military violence against the civil population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repressals against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired for a peaceful demonstration in the place and killed 300 people. At this time, left-right student movements were in the establishment of themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training possibilities led young people to criminal bands.
The United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the increased activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the USA should double their expenditure on research in this area, says investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on KI announcements in various areas of the U.S. government, even though the United States generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the number 1 in the field of KI innovation until 2030.
"The double of the budget for KI research would be a good beginning, given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the United States. We are looking for the next KI breakthrough." Lee said.
The double of the financial resources could double the chances that the next major KI results would be achieved in the United States, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University at an AI system that defeated the highest positioned American Othello player. Later he was head of director at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Destination in China.
Lee appreciated former technology competitions from the US government, such as the robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive State subsidies.
“Not China takes the academic top forces away, but the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years set up Koryphes of universities to work on KI.
According to Read, a changed immigration policy of the United States could also be favourable for the efforts made by the United States.
“I think that in the field of KI promovated people should be automatically offered Greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technology (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances persons to academic facilities similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations to grant money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower.
In the beginning of this year, the US Defence Ministry founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in partners from industry and science. In addition, the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee for Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the ‘AI Next’ initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars annually in KI research.
In the meantime, in the United States, the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been doing anything for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on a change in the country name
The population of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed in the Republic of North Macedonia. This measure would include a decade of an old dispute with Greece, which blocked the requests of Macedonia to be entered into the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of his northern neighbor means that this right is raised to the Greek territory, and therefore Greece has put a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum. A Boykott campaign doubts that the electoral participation reaches the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you for a membership in the NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Understanders of the change in name, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the price is worth for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would follow the result so that it is crucial.
The change in name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The state elections Commission said there were no reports on irregularities until 13.00 a.m.
However, the participation of the elections was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of the registered voters.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will give up on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, their voice in the referendum on the change in the country name that Macedonia would open the way to the NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage before Parliament in Skopje, and put chairs before tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for the NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised main, not through the back-in," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can use others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will lead to urgent investments needed for Macedonia, whose unemployment rates are more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority of this will be because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'Yes' result would be a 'exercise of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This figure is under the required election participation.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of it said they would vote with "yes".
In order to succeed the referendum, the electoral participation must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the politics of the prowest government since its power overtake in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manövrated through the entire Brighton defense to achieve gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling transfer the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his meetings look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field.
He rushed between three Brighton defence players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw around four green tricots.
He played around a defendant and then overcome several other defenders at the edge of Brighton Criminal Area.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the prison room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overturned with his right shoe Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot to the right side of the network.
“Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he reached a gate at this moment."
It was, however, Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Dual.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steilpass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues-Angreifer targeted the ball into the network shortly before it shot out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals were excreted from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further use.
The always powerful joke, however, hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies who have a game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the Playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard on Friday evening with a 5:2 victory on the nationals, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Even if we play for nothing, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not yet announced a start player for Sunday, but they are inclined to make a joke in such a situation after reports.
Scars, for which this would be the 34th use as start player, practiced on Thursday in the Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington legal hands have a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds customers in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Brett Kavanaugh selected by the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the intermediate elections.
“All we have done is in the game in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
This is one of the big, big ones – I don't approach, but in reality I'm entering, so I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happens now.
And they are determined to take over the power with all means, you see the commonness, the absurdness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to go over to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, see their mission to "compete and block".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats as "awesome and common and awesome and dishonest."
He named the highest democrat in the Senate Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud bow calls at the audience.
“Remember you their answer?
Have you left the document outside?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer applies to all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party were voting to trick me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, since she had raised herself energy against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the Tadel request that I represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, over Europe, ironically about similar issues that Jeremy with former top politicians did not have a view.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said "the meetings should be all involved and productive".
Mostly, in my eight years, the Friday evening meetings of the GC were just that as local Labour Members.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this sound, and the promised 'friendly, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started at all.
It is increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will be assessed afterwards whether they are accepted by the peak of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues I believed to share similar political views in the past were now expecting me to make a turning-up and to take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed - whether it was national security or European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – it follows a sjimptirade in the social media that calls for my choice, calls on the political center and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I'm not there alone.
In fact, I know that it's better for me than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who every day look at a flood of sexist or racist discomforts and never devote little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is the fact that minorities have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked last week the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we do not have any opinions to apply, and with any mistrust and any change in the rules of elections, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I was often advised to put my head in and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have "no problems".
But I didn't go into politics.
Since I was a student of 32 years ago, caused by the negligence of the Thatcher government, because my classroom in the general school literally fell apart, joined the Labour Party, I fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as municipal council as well as as cabinet minister.
I have never made a hole of my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear on my political positions and on areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: in view of the fact that the country is going to rush to a Brexit, which will harm households, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am proud to serve you, not to Nottingham momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many election threats or political thoughts will not prevent me from acting in my opinion the best interest of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbound Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this very entertaining game of the day in the Tent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unfailed at the table top.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better chance recovery, and trainer Peter Murchie had all reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games until now, and we are still unbelieved, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they have better rewarded their opportunities than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, because of a yellow map for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game of the Warriors, Melrose could let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot did not have an increased attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a prosecution before he reached a hit directly at the mid-term and then achieved an increased attempt in the single, so that it stood for the break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose, however, started the second half time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After continuing, Ayr built his proximity by a climo increased attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as a captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow map, and again Melrose allowed the additional man to pay enormous pressures at the end of a phase by a non-increased attempt from Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the offence gases from a touchdown behind the front Ayr package.
Climo increased, as almost since the interrupt, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxkick had captured and flamingo player Gregor Henry sent to the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” Star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems ready for a change in the guest business after it revealed that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC mission, whose turnbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-year comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the forthcoming nineth pillar will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craig.
According to official registrations, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in climbing into Glasgow's “florating restaurant business”.
‘The sea belongs to us’: the Bolivia included by the country hopes that a court opens him the way to the Pacific
Matroses patrol before the sea headquarters in La Paz decorated with Tauwerk.
In public buildings, a more blue flag waves.
Flower bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon are the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Recovering it is a duty."
Everywhere in the country-included Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section of Chile lost in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive as the desire to travel over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice, which will be adopted on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the swing, a spirit of unity and leave and expects the result of a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will persecute the IGH's judgment on large-screen screens across the country, in the hope that the court in the Hague will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sophisticated access to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous President, who is in the next year a controversial struggle for his re-electing, there is also a great deal in the judgment on Monday.
"We are just standing before returning to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the Court decides to benefit Bolivia, and believe that there would be little changes thereby.
The United Nations Organization with seat in the Netherlands is not empowered to address chilenic territory and has established that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the IGH's judgment has been held six months after the final pledge, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert on international law, suggests that the case was "not complicated".
In the absence of supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a relapse.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warrioric rhetoric has stumbled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at any time, but after these events this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the view that the decision of the Court was unusually rapidly dealt with.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“end the 139 years of disputes toward mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales – still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crown.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is a chance to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never ruin her nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made in practice between the Heads of State of Rivals in Singapore during a summit.
His statements come at a time when US Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, appears to be shortly before the North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore, more than three months after the summit with the North Korean Head of State.
Ri mentioned the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the United States would ever force the north to the knee against a declaration of the end of the Korean war as "the brain spinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without that Pjöngjang first takes essential disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, it is widespread skepsis that Pjøngjang seriously meant the absence of a arsenal, where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjøngjang for the next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or to shield the sun completely, you no longer have to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy overlarged head coverings for their summer collection in 2019, which fascinated the fascinating fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractical guards have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creatures over the run step.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige colored hat with a federous wide edge that just pushed the heads of the models.
As other superdimensional accessories, watermelones, a magic hat and even an ananas were shown, but they are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were seen with lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with Haute Couture.
A creation similar to a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glass, while another looked like a melted edible.
And if you want to put another huge fashion station, you're lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The superdimensional hats follow directly on “La Bomba”, the Strohhut with 60 cm wide edge, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat, which swallowed large waves into the social media, sent another large creation over the running step: a beach bag of stroh, which was almost as large as a bathing suit that holds the bag.
The bastache in red orange with bastfruits and a white leather pencil was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has so much experience that the demand for superdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Languages for World Citizens Indispensable
Schottland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued with further outstanding test results in 2018 and is only undermined by individual and common successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community businesses.
With more than 30 000 students from all Scotland, these schools represented by Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are seeking to maintain their students and their parents at the highest level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector, which can form a customized learning plan and actually implement, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as electoral vessels.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will gain his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year consider that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students learning foreign languages achieved Note A in the higher tests.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in the higher trials, while 72 percent of the students learned German, 69 percent of the students learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also reached Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are considered as electoral vessels as well as STEM factors (Natural Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called open job problems were related to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledges are essential in a globalised world.
Indeed, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage by such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual individuals will automatically be given a prompt before candidates.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to entertain, and French was spoken as a single language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for the children of today that we are now investing in language education.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find a meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child is interested, in independent schools a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers will always be elected.
Schottic independent schools are engaged in creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, as the future looks.
At this time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication capacity”.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James enters for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers Trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the front season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, but still isn't fixed.
“It will be more than one and less than 48” said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twisted that James will probably play just a few minutes.
In the beginning of this week, James was asked for training for his plans for the six games of the Lakers' full seasonal game plan.
"I don't need pre-saison games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Time for Trumps Customership in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trumps five programs planned for the next week, including well-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his choice for the vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wishes to build support for the present semi-time elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the congress.
When is Trumps' customer gift in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see online?
Trumps Customership in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trumps customers in West Virginia below as livestream at YouTube online.
Trump is likely to respond to the hearings of the Brett Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court to the accusations of sexual abuse that have been carried out this week in an excited atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the sweep until one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main objective of this series of customers is, however, to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in one November.
Consequently, President Trump's electoral battle team to Reuters stated that the next week these five customers serve to mobilise “voluntary and adherents, while the Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the representative house”.
“The control of the congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel to as many state as possible, while the operational campaign season is near," said a tromp game speaker who didn't want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the "Ooio and Pennsylvania" customers in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could participate in the "Ooio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the republikan Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to try to drive him into the surveys," said Simon Haeder, policeologist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows fighting willingness to maintain the hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendel of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment of their opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it are four, I think that this means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the place.
Europe, of course, is in the advantage and is on the front of four points, while twelve others follow.
However, the Americans, according to Spieth, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from decline to green and goes forward with a good example.
The goodural enthusiastic shouts were louder in the further course of his round when he lowered an important puppet to decide the fourth match with four points for themselves after he and Thomas had left back after two holes with two points.
His Putt, who decided the match for her on the 15th hole, triggered a similar cry that makes it clear that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to knee and care for my own game," said Spieth.
That's all the rest of the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have, as a single player, achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's inequal, but sympathic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple who had not struck a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently between them and the excessive amount of flowing energy undermines that they are the players that are going to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who conquer a possible European victory when the sun declines over Le Golf National.
preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking from European praise would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the four-held of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a climb that they could not overcome closer to.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them from the climb.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating as to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or not, and the way a strategy can change rapidly.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in the leadership of the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the team of the United States is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, had doubts.
Europe is headed on the last day of Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is in front of the fours and four parties from Saturday to the United States with 10:6 and goes with a solid front in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genius-playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories about the tiger Woods fighting with trouble and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, referred to by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to recover the Trophees lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the American team that played wrongly and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not pick up the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in success as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend “Molliwood” only won four points as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening games.
After hitting Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized outstandingly and struck the entranced woods and the American Neuling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more persistent 5&4.
Woods, who had slept through two matches on Saturday, let his brilliance suddenly flash up, but now 19 of his 29 matches lost in four and four parties and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, who rested during the four in the morning, returned and played as a partner of Henrik Stenson the four parties. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
However, for Europe on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not run everything according to their ideas.
The three-fold Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measurement sheet for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the fours they won a county 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3, after they lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only two times that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a remnant of four points. However, as a titleholder enough for Furyk's team, a disagreement to keep the troop.
After they've been on the second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral degradation without confidence
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korean Foreign Minister said that persistent sanctions would deepen their distrust to the United States, and the country would not, in any case, give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that the last year, North Korea took significant measures from “good will” and, for example, it stopped nuclear and rocket tests, degraded the nuclear test area and required not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"With no confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not one-sidedly reproduce ourselves first."
While Ri relyed on North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phasen-wise" approach in the denuklearisation, at which North Korea would reward for succsive steps, his statement seemed significant when she did not reject one-sided denuklearization from the way it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim was assured to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump was assured to guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korea war conducted from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngjang first had to give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for a locking of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States stands on "first denuklearisation" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and is even opposed to the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
“The assumption that penalties can force us into the knees is a brain spinst of the people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the persistent sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not accept plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted with the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If South Korea instead of the United States would have been the other party in the denuklearisation question, it would not have come to this stop when the Korean peninsula was denuclearized.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to aim with North Korea's rocket to the United States Festival, after “the evil president” Trump Kim had called“raketenmann” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to the “final destruction” of North Korea last year, overwhelmed Kim with praise for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that there was still a lot of work to be done and the penalties would remain in force until the denuklearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: “If it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council Pjøngjang must reward the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued energyfully until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuklearisation.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to remove Pjönganng's programmes for nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets financially.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjøngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he said in the departure from Pjøngjang that progress had been made to be accused only for hours later by North Korea, he has made “pass-like claims”.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States took "compliant measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the aimed "compliant measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep during this year's basic study. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture to keep themselves alert with caffeine and learn the whole night.
A scientist has found that students at the leading university of the world are often unnecessary when it comes to watching themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes that he is the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after holding a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“On the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I learn about it only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me." he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained the students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after finding that students were severely sleeping during the week.
The single-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee bags, covers, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of coffee and light as well as the effects of sleep deficiencies on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Afterwards, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine, using a map of the university area with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride to push a ‘night layer’ is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on the students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
He said that the “home gun” of all students should be against stress, fatigue and fears. In addition, a weight increase could be avoided, since sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had been in Harvard last year in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgradual students will be invited to conduct a similar study programme before taking their study at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set awake for the time of sleep and the waking time and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that are based on electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the Zircadian rhythm out of the pace. This leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forced Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outdoor game than the matching of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unconsistent team meant a 0:1 low position at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first outward victory since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team is left eight points behind the hearts leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership with distance.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the inspirational poor Rangers seemed not to have a chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies at the Tordifferenz only behind Hibernian.
The Rangers is also threatening further trouble after the ruler Calum Spence had to be treated for a headworn by an object that appeared to be thrown from the guest block.
Gerrard took eight changes to the team that overcome Ayr and reached the half-final of Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, remained at the same eleven Livingston players who took a point to the heart last week, and would have to be excited as his well trained team kept their opponents under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
You should have reached a gate after only two minutes when Mengas first departure Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregors Tor. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot then.
Then, a long release of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only precipitate on the back.
The Rangers took over control, but their game worked in the last third rather hopefully than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was evident in the opinion that after a quarter of time, he should have been injured because of a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not let the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half of the Rangers only arrived two torshots, but the former Ibrox Torhüter Liam Kelly had hardly trouble with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a fair shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's meeting in the 34th minute may not match the game history, it is not denied that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and picked Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in the half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the wings player Morelos positioned, but the impressive Kelly quit from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to play precisely the game that lies with them, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor kept standing well and rejected Jacobs before Lithgow predecessed a headball from the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded late a penalty for a multitude of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter of Science has also become a standard element of popculture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What in the whole world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a kid!"
“His” Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that wears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ disturbed cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy deceased cells.
The vaccine contributes to the immune system to detect deteriorated cells.
The method contains immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can see a number of cancer types of common protein and will then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer types.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect disturbed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method contains immune cells that are altered in the laboratory so that they can see the many cancer types of common protein HER2. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of various types of cancer", including breast-, eggstock, lung and darm cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method where patients are taken from immune cells and learned to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a leukaemia type.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Canye West was built out at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had praised and said he wanted to join as a presidency candidate in 2020.
After carrying his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and thereby carrying a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a shimp-canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I'm so often asked by the Whites, ‘How can you like trump? He's a racist.’
So, if I were to worry about racism, I had left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Shimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by Comiker Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his head coverage.
“They have swept me behind the stage.
You said, ‘Don't go out with the cap’.
You've kicked me!
And then they say I'm in a degraded area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the deceased area?" He said that he would “to dress my supermancape, because that means that you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go with the world?
Try with love."
His comments produced at least twice bow calls from the audience, and SNL employees were touching, Variety reported. One person said the magazine: “It was deadenstill in the studio.”
West was late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title “I Love it”, where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA. She twisted: “On one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, DAS DU THE MASSE APPLICAL HAST.”
The Talkshow operator Karen Hunter, however, twisted that West is just he himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I would like to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes himself to a harmful ideology for my community and gives himself, NOT (when I buy his music or his clothes or support his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us." added she.
Before sending, the Rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The being formally known as Kanye West” (It is officially known as Canye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion, and of course, Prince, the dead musician, changed his name to a symbol and then to “The Artist Formerly Know As Prince” (the formerly known artist).

“Game of Thrones” Star Kit Harington attacks toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violence-powered medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actress attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such rolls on the screen would have resulted in the feeling that boys often had to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said that he believes something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic male in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also a member of the "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution of the problem was "very important" to him.
“I personally think the question at present is very important what has happened wrong with maleness," he said.
"What have we taught growing men in terms of the problem we are watching now?"
Harington believes that television may be responsible for increasing toxic maskulinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the street that boys give the feeling to have to embrace this particular side of a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men have clearly done something wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series, he will not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" after the next summer. He has "gay of battle fields and horses".
From November on, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's “True West”, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actress recently told him that for him, "Game of Thrones" was the best thing to know his wife Rose.
“I have met my wife in this mission, so in this way I have received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played the fantasy series Ygritte, who loved Harington's character, Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslies' family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported an increase of 14 % in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 8200,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 only about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in most of the new cases by sex.
Until now, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who had been infected with HIV in this way had been almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials indicated at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, in the annual comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100 000 in China.
The HIV transfer by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the discrimination of members of the LGBT community is to be widely widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of the men who have sex with men are eventually married women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to insufficient protection of sex in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees were able to use the data of the GOP-senators, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
Maxine Waters, members of the U.S. Representative House, held on Saturday claims that a member of their staff has published the personal information of three republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that the claims of "unlawful" experts and websites would be spread.
“Look, lies and more absurd lies”, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published should contain the private addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate Committee, they were published on the charges of sexual infringements raised against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of contributions was assigned to Waters’ Office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
“This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the transmission of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ Declaration triggered rapid criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," said Fleischer.
“This makes it clear that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done may not be angry.
You can't be proud.
You may not question the motives of the applicant.
They must be quiet and left."
Meaters seemed to compare Waters’ response to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having done too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joins the semi-time elections to release Waters, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if it is true,” he twitted.
Waters said in her statement that their office informed the competent authorities and criminal persecution authorities about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the actors are revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be accounted for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all members of my staff.”
Critics for “Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak spionage parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to search for Brexit references in every British colored new film. This seems to apply for this releasing of the actioncomödien-parodie-Franchise “Johnny English” that began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion that decorated it” and 2011 with “Johnny English – Now just right”.
Will an ironic self-paradies about the subject, as obviously we are condemned, become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimass cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema seekers in the non-English language room.
Of course, he is again the clever secret agent, who bizarrely thinks he's cool and worldly, while in reality he contributed from something Clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a cock of this boy who, at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London, has a single note to the title melodie of "The hour of the victory".
In addition, the figure originally was based on the chaos behind the travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the currently forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor leaves were shortly covered by his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comics occurs, but the humor seems quite weak and strangely overfluent, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" in the meantime offer self-safe commodian elements.
The humor seems to focus more on children than on adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy misbehavior is not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's Stummfilmgat in the role of the Bean.
The ever-current premise is now that Great Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret British spionage network and reveals the identity of all British agents in use, very for the failure of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strohhalm for the Prime Minister, a blowed and stressed figure, which is already faced by its political inconvenience before the complete collapse: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May charter, but the script does not give much to work with.
Their secret service advisers inform them that all active spiones have been disintegrated and therefore they have to get someone out of the pension.
This also includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a craftsman's office, but there is unofficial instruction in working as a subcover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spionage academy memorized to "School of Rock".
English is brought back to a emergency meeting to Whitehall and reunited with his former severely tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot Commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are again in action. They meet Olga Kurylenkos's beautiful Fem Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister seems dangerous in the ban of a charismatic Tech millionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the big spices: As a caller clothes they put a delicate French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxuryacht, and English triggers pure anarchie as he trys to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house using a Virtual Reality headsets.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathically and funny it is, the topic is already fully negotiated in the child television.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that will really justify his talent?"
Labour struggles to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is intended to consider a radical plan that provides that the British are working four days a week but paid for five days.
The party wishes to report that business leaders will forward the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by the trade union (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - level source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: “A directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"The change will not occur during the night, but a four-day week of work is an endeavour that is in line with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance to the benefit of workers and the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: “In a 4-day week it is not party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Cancer John McDonnell concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was firmly determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow cannon also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retire their entire share, as a Labour government could take a "deduction" due to an assuming misbehavior.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to call employees into the businesses and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds in order to transfer 10% of private enterprises' equity to employees that cash up to 500 pounds annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine “60 minutes” whether the investigation of the FBI in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the prosecutions against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended a final vote on his appointment to the Judge of the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority of the Republican Senators could affect to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the republikan senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could present something that could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told the negotiation that I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this claim was expressed and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, definite and inconscious."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be melted into stone.
“My opinion is firm on Brett Kavanaugh, and there would have to be a bomb," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has struggled this vehement," added Graham and refered to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York to combat an annual music festival with an impressive lineup on stars and a so impressive mission – the poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the appearances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen the consciousness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. In this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to fight poverty by increasingly motivating people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket) you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politicians worldwide (per e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project if you think that global citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of making a cool free concert a good way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called Clicktivism – if you think it is to change something by signing an online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global citizens informed that since 2011 the project has been able to identify more than 19 million actions by its supporters and to achieve different objectives.
These actions should have contributed to stimulate leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies in the value of more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers with seat in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight underernähring in the country after they have received more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With supporting the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of underernähring a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 actions in which Britain was asked to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
As a response to one of the often asked questions on the website, namely the question why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and strangerous way with heights and depths.
But like the great movements of citizens' rights and anti-apartness in front of us, we will have success, as we are together stronger and more influenced.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belongs to the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as Moderators.
The United States could use the marine for blockade purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – the Ministry of Interior
According to Washington's Examine, Washington can access the marine if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the U.S. Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a predecessor to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working on the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official there are means and ways to deal with this.
"The United States can ensure, together with the Marine, that the lake roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he informed.
Zinke was referring to the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood as the "Voice of the Electricity Consumers" in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he called Russia "One Trick Pony" with a fossil fuel-related economy.
The declarations were made when the government under Trump was in expanding the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump themselves, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Pipeline project Nord Stream 2, with which Trump Berlin became a captive Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as means to exercise pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said the Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of the German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a major problem when a third country is mixed into our energy supply”, says the Board of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Kanzler Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine a presidential candidate in 2020,” says the Senator for Massachusetts.
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would "check a presidency candidate" after the intermediate elections.
During a Town-Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our ruined government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren intends to ‘examine a presidency candidate’ after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country into the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in her criticism on Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, it is obvious that a FBI investigation is required.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren elections do not believe that it should be able for 2020.
According to the survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not be able.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of the former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who favour a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are against it.
Among the other names of prominent Democrats, which are in question with regard to a possible candidate in 2020, the former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, bids informed that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on the Donald Trump-Ralley to posttraumatic load disturbance, under the Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son endures, what he gets through when he comes back, all that can reflect other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she informed the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as “Elefant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back to change, that they would come back, that they would come back and ask themselves whether there was this respect before what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military gave to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence to a woman, says Dan Bennett, a speaker of the Wasilla police authority.
18 State and D.C. support a new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a new US politics that refuse victims of bandenactivities or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 state states and the district entered a judicial declaration on Friday in Washington to support an asylum candidate questioning the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-gen-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Policy in August has not been announced.
She informed that her partner “and his violent bandage sons” abused them, but U.S. officials rejected their asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace named El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people make a request for asylum in the United States as nations who have to fight with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014 which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum from domestic violence.
The President-in-Office of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “the decades of legislation at state, federal and international level are ignored”.
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications are assessed based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the application and that court is infringing this principle," was stated in the Court's declaration.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the declaration that the policies which immigrants refused access to the country have a negative impact on the economy in the United States, as immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary employees.
In June, Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges would no longer give victims who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands to asylum.
"Asyl is there for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," said Sessions in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to eliminate, by granting asylum, all the problems, even all serious problems with which people have to fight every day worldwide.
desperate attempts to rescue in Palu, as the number of death victims is doubled in the race with time
For survivors, the situation has grown worse.
“It's all very excited," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fevering son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new hospital car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their nearest possession and good and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who increased wrist breaks and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Military Hospital of Palu, where patients in the outer area were treated because of the persistent strong descendants.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the vicious earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“All went too fast.
I think I was attached to the enclosed walls," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help calls, but then it was rest.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. messengers complain to China of the Tyrannei with “Propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had launched a four-sided ad in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were announced, the U.S. messenger in China accused the state capital of Peking to use the American press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump refered last Wednesday to the paid appendix of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the Congress elections of the United States on 6 November, a complaint contradicting China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to mix into the US elections correspond to the communication of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exercise pressure on China.
While it is common that foreign governments turn out advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outstanding trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese recompensation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. messengers in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, exporting largely agricultural products to China, informed that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies.
China, so Branstad in a position in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this Tyrannei by turning propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the best practice in America of the free opinion and the independent press by switching the country paid advertising in the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, you will find at the newspaper skis here in Beijing only in a limited number of counterparties and do not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese could have about the disturbing economic development of China, in view of the fact that the media are firmly in the hand of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer for publication of his article, but he did not name the name of the newspaper.
Republicans praise electoral women before the intermediate elections with the Debakel about Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most impressive Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the coming intermediate elections, which could be particularly of women.
The vote in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue with a vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of the Syracuse University The Hill for a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute prosecution of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for an FBI investigation in order to address anxiety voters.
“Don't forget what was yesterday, she don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said the Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, so the day newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the "November is coming" section of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold on the nomination of Kavanaughs and, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, informed Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political observer of the news page.
“The people say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in choosers in the front and in younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who often do not choose, although they do not like the President."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual attacks against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
“This situation is a sharp interference for the GOP," said the NBC News at the beginning of the last week, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
"It's not only about the vote of the Board, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, a group who supports the electoral of Democrats, informed the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be inconsistent, who should believe them on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of the statement of Ford, while 35% indicated that they were definitive or likely to give Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% claimed that they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford, last week before the Senate Jurisdiction Committee, gave a statutory statement that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17 years.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed her to his genitals when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans the start of a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, interrupted, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, Berners-Lee said that the intent behind invasion is the “vilthroughship”.
"We need to become active now," he said about the topic of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and business area.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access what data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to John Bruce’s CEO, the idea behind break is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities so that Solid is available for everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for the work on this project, and a Community voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the break-out website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange themselves with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change should be made, with which their entire business models are completely transformed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a medium contribution published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that breakdown has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months Berners-Lee was significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inruption, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, coach of the Viktoric Cross in World War 1, was honored
The only clergy of the Church of England, who was awarded as a fighter with the Viktoria Cross during the first World War, was honored 100 years later in his home city.
Colonel Leutnant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 due to his use when attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp protector and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero, for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918 Colonel Vann led his Bataillon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through thick fools and under violent guns of field cannons and machines.
Later, he went to the fireline and led the line forward with the "great thoroughness" before he had a field gun in the entrance and switched out three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on 4 October 1918 by a German sharp protector; something more than one month before the end of war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something that he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vandn, he put a crane after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann indicated that he felt very honorable to be able to participate in the Parade, adding that the tappingness of a real hero will be visible, especially by supporting many people.
MMA fans stayed alert all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed alert all night to see a exciting bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The account of San Jose included 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was delivered live all night in the United Kingdom to channel 5.
At 6 o'clock then, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the sighters in the United Kingdom weren't bad when they suddenly saw Peppa Pig.
Some remained unaffected after they stayed alert until the early morning hours to see the battle specially.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick movie figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“On the basis of a regime of the government, these content are classified as non youth-free, so that at 6 o’clocks had to be switched to a child-sensition," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Company Board at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will edit the schedule in order to take viewers from the United Kingdom into account in the future.
"I think that the problem could already be solved in the recurrent game," he said.
“But it is 6 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday with the sighters in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying.
During the change, a lot of communication was made. It went very nicely and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem from the government.
I promise that this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 struggles, like normally, and we've tried to offer the fan's best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sorry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "low" in the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subdued to all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old believed that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke on the issue of sulphur rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became father, the victory in the Olympic Games is no longer so important for him.
The real modernist of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease condition for a few months.
In the first consignment of Laverne, he said that earlier, compared with others, he considered himself less valuable, since love for boys and girls was completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, feeling is to be subdued and different from the others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used its appearance in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this issue because he is happy to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to courage others.
The three-fold world champion loved the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. Knowledge to love a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winners, but he shared that the difference in age had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had to get through so much as a child and a youth – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time, and his father died in cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire vision has changed since then.
Last year, all about gold medals would have turned around him.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia Gold Medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearby death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
"I couldn't tell him that he would no longer be there," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he was not inviable," he continued.
In the following year, Daley won the Bronze Medaille at the Olympic Games 2012.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in Olympic games before the local audience – that was the crazy thing," he said.
His first song selection – the prud of Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for gance skin.

Mickelson, currently not in form, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to try very much so that the whole doesn't become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays at the event at the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the event, the five-fold major conqueror spent his day fireing and working on his game, in the hope of fixing the problems that burden him.
Even at the ceiling of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the close Le Golf National golf course, where missing balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson in the ninth game on Sunday meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined with Tommy Fleetwood, newling in these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points of rest at the 12 single games put a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and was not able to add much to it.
“He was perfect about his current role in clarity, gave me a clapp on my back and put his arm around me and said that he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities, and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week too.
I wouldn't have thought he'd be with two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games emitted on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway, which never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can sign 18 victories, had to put 20 defeat and reached seven half times, although Furyk announced that his presence has already enriched the team alone.
"He is funny and sarkastic, original and likes to make a few bites, and he is a great man who is popular throughout the team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week. It was fun to see them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the spring soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great spring that leads to the last individual games in Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
In 1997, the Dan debuted in Valderrama, where a team directed by Seven Ballesteros had a front of five points against the Americans, but only almost over the target line and led with the smallest possible front and won a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great front in Valderrama, we had a great spring in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was just little," said Bjørn (on the photo), after he had seen the victory 5–3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it's going on right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is over only when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and just there is our focus.
I've always said that I've focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's against us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued: “I would never override this.
Tomorrow another calibrator will be.
Tomorrow, the individual services are in the foreground, and that is a completely different thing.
It is great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you are out there alone, you will be tested as golfer until the limits of his skills.
You have to make this clear to the players: Get out the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, his counter to Jim Furyk will ensure that his players separately cut off better than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that great turning on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before he stood on the sides of the losers after the “Wonder of Medinah” in Europe.
"I remember every fucking word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you've seen in Brookline and in Medinah.
If the momentum hits in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to clean up tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of getting out to counterfeit, he has to join in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rank list.
“I have decided for the boys in this order, because I believe it covers everything," said Bjorn about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest fregates of the German Marine should have been put in service in 2014 to replace war ships coming in the years from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, they will be delivered due to malicious systems and rapidly growing costs until the next year.
The entry into service of the ‘Rhineland-Pfalz’, the leadership of the brand new fregates of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, was now shifted to the first half of 2019 according to the time that commissioned on a military speaker.
The ship had already had to be served in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by alarming problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Marine in 2007, should replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to contain a powerful canone, a number of flight defence tractors and sea target airlines as well as tarn technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays may result in the old age of the high-modern war ships, which are supposed to represent Germany as sea power, at the time of their entry into service, according to the time.
The Fregate F125, persecuted by the accident last year, came into the battle lines when the German Marine officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine returned a ship after its delivery to the ship.
It was not known about the reasons for return, but German media called a series of significant 'software and hardware failures' that the new ship would have made unusable in a fight situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance buits and prevents the marine from being able to carry out restructuring measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy ‘Rhineland-Pfalz’ appeared to be twice as difficult as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the malicious hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, were also a problem.
The cost seemed to increase to atmosphere €3.1 billion, compared to the original 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's sea force is shrinking.
In the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, war officer of the German Federal Day, confirmed that the Marine was “coming out of the employed ships”.
Bartels said that the problem grew by time, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the marine.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of the Fledermäuse
New research work is being carried out in a property in the Scottish Highlands, which is intended to show how fladermäus use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insights in the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to initiate future natural protection activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will explore dwarf and mugged flour mice as well as the brown long ear and water flair mice in Invereve Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the flager mice during the entire season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the fladermous calls is determined and the kinds are doing something.
Afterwards, a map and a habitat report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show the most important areas of the living space for the flager mice and how these are used by any species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of wheat, and to demonstrate how to obtain forest areas for flour mice and other related species.
The fledermous stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flying fans and chemical treatment of construction materials or also attacks by house cats.
Fledermouse isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching rods.
They use an expanded equipment to identify insects and obstacles in their flight course.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country throughout Scotland takes the theme of the Fledermäuse very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only Fledermausreservate in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Goodsman David Thompson explains that the presence of the ideal living room is for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for flager mills," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things we don't know about Fledermäuses yet, so we carry out these works here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what fladermice needs to feel well."
He stresses the importance of excludeing the presence of flager mice before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nestplace could kill up to 400 females and young animals and delete the entire population on the spot.
Fledermouse is under protection and it is illegal to kill them, to harm them or to destroy them or their nest places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to assist.
She explains: “We have to learn much about fladermouses, and in many of our species we don't know how it is about their populations.”
Ronaldo struggles off rape claims while his lawyers want to complain about the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to his rape prosecution as “Fake News” and said that by using his name, people want to be “remembered”.
His lawyers plan to complain to the news magazine The mirror that published the accusations.
The storm of the Portuguese National Team and Juventus Turin was accused of raising an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He said he paid her $37,000 to buy her silence to the incident, says The Mirror on Friday.
In an instagram live video to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo 33-year-old only named the reports hours after its publication as “Fake News”.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-month winner of the ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to complain to the mirror because of the accusations they called, according to Reuters, "inappropriate report for suspicions in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the gravity of legal injury, which is probably one of the most serious injuries of personality rights in recent years.”
The claimed incident should have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to go into the player's room, where he had, according to documents submitted at the Clark County Court in Nevada, deliberately raped anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the claimed incident, went to the knee and said to her, he was "99 percent a good guy", which was the "a percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say that it had been agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later came to an unlawful agreement, since she had “angry for recompensation” and cared for being“reduced” publicly.
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to cancel the agreement, since it is still traumatic because of the claimed incident.
Ronaldo, at the time of the claimed event, was shortly standing to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid and switched this summer into a 100 million euro deal to the Italian Riesen Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repend forever’ the loss of the car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “repent forever” if after Brexit lost its status as a world-wide leading manufacturer of cars, economic minister Greg Clark says.
He continued to say that it was “angry” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production in Burnaston at Derby should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border at a no-deal braxit could result in the loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, in which Toyota's product lines are produced Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150.000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience at an uncontrolled Brexit end of March production stops in our work”, says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made fears of a harsh EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it's gonna close his mini work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns are, according to the car manufacturers, associated with risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a ‘just in-time’ base. This means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both from the United Kingdom and the EU to manage the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may come to interruptions which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and crises in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to carry a stock in the work in Derbyshire that is sufficient for more than one day, the company explained why production should be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU is “definitely designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only the current success but also this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 mission today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production should be interrupted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been busy in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functioner of the Unit's Federation in work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is never returning these jobs once they are gone.
One government speaker said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trumps planned meeting with Rosenstein could be re-located according to the White House's information
Donald Trumps' important meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein could “be suspended for another week” while the dispute about the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, it was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the oversight of the work of the specialist Robert Mueller, who examines the electoral interferences by Russia, relations between Trumps consultants and Russia, as well as a possible legal disability by the President.
The question whether Trump would fire the Vice-President and thus threaten Mueller's independence was subject to rumors in Washington for a month.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke to the possibility of the secret recording of his conversations with Trump and the president's office using the 25th Constitutional Addition.
Rosenstein declared the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed return were known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at this time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid that it was in conflict with the hearing before the Jurisdiction Committee of the U.S. Senate, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had pronounced sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump arranged a weekly FBI investigation of the prosecutions against Kavanaugh, which continued to delay the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps Press Speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question about meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be suspended for another week, in view of all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the running."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has no longer held the press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences does not lie on a rejection against the "effective hachetry" of the TV reporters, but admitted: "I wouldn't dispute that they operate efficacy hatching."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers than any President before him," she said, without giving accurate evidence, "We have looked at these figures."
There will still be press conferences, though Sanders, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, but much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in the past weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or takes part in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignities.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the President may have shown why this is the case when he put a bit of bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.
Minister for Health writes because of the Brexit concerns with EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Ministry of Health is referring to people from the EU foreign countries who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) in order to express the gratitude of the country and to express their wish to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter from the EU less than six months before the United Kingdom is out.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to carry the costs of requests for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in your letter: “In the course of the summer, the dispatch negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected to be made.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I am conscious of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Members and colleagues from all over the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skill that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and thus benefit the patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was undergone after a head injury of an emergency surgery
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tiger's Christion Abercrombie, according to the information made by Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was undergoing an emergency surgery on Saturday at 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the chief trainer of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the side line and was simply broken there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before being placed on a tragedy and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of injury” are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State during his first season after he changed from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 takles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 takles.
For the real estate purchase in the United Kingdom, foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax
Investors from abroad will need to raise higher rates for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom in the future.
This step will end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign on young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will cover all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance calculates a total of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the more revenues to benefit the homeless.
This step represents an attempt to hamper Jeremy Corbyn's success in young electorates, who promises to provide more affordable living rooms and to take top-valuers into the shower.
The increase in stamp tax will be raised to individuals and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue will be given to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on two apartments and the rental homes may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance estimates by the step of increases of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built property in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. This will drive prices up to the height and it will be more difficult for first buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many welcoming areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “geist cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy will follow only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has spoken for a reduction of the stamp tax to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies to keep the real estate prices high by buying land without using it, and forced Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's "Wohnraumschande".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a prominent number of proposals for housing reforms, which are sufficient from a rental price binding to a ban on space without a proper reason.
He also wants to grant city boards more powers when building new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister for the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our destroyed apartment market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build up a life.
However, it cannot be correct that it is equally easy for people who are not living in Britain, as well as for companies seated abroad to buy real estates as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the indignity of the homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, Head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘great goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at any time.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of bringing the association from the north-east England's new life, which is just on the third place in the League One and missing the three points to the top.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after he brought St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it on the bank and that was's," said Ross of the mission Sport sound of BBC Scotland.
“But I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden as a child with my father and that is something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I had been successful in association management."
Ross predecessors in the role as Sunderland Manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic claimed not to be afraid to enter such etablated names at such a club after rejecting previous offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will now be measured on whether I can bring the association back to the Prime League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is without doubt belonging to the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not a easy task to get him there, but I'd only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can present a three-year management career, after a phase as a vice-president boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a trainer in hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third League and held St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says that he feels better than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real dialway," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did not feel bad, could live well of it and experience some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so well in my skin throughout my life as a adult."

The heat wave in summer has missed the revenues of Great Britain's crisling pubs, while restaurant chains run under larger pressure.
Pub and bar companies reported a sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the company's advice CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “Continuous sunshine and England's longer than expected continued participation in the football championship, meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where Pubs could record sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent that the restaurant industry recorded in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks showed with distance the best performance, with a surface-reconstituted turnover development that increased higher than they fell at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people were just trying to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the recreational and hospital business RSM, explained: “These results continue the trend we could observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the largest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight with problems, but sales income of 4.8 per cent from the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could have come at no worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains waiting for the more moderate temperatures in August to provide the urgent atmosphere needed."
The total turnover growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decrease in brand rollouts.
The industry turnover monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret to parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 students in continuing schools has seen an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fear that sexual content are posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to own a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret to adults.
A survey among 20 000 students at further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the Photo-Sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fear that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean "main account" that they can show their parents, but also private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to "violate me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half assigned to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, explained: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being betrayed to create online rooms in which parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be “the voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected at its annual general meeting as non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council.
Doyle is the most outstanding lightathletin of Scotland and the Chairman Ian Beattie describes the choice as a great opportunity for sports functioners to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Light-Athletics Community of Scotland, the Great Britain and the World, and we are sure that light-atletics in Scotland would benefit very much from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, totally called four Olympic Gold Medals and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient transfusion disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say nobody can say whether or how far I will heal.
It was hard work, but I have completely recovered, learned to run again and do motion exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of dairy pumps provided excitement in the network with a advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers were compared with the milk of cows.
In order to put the market in the "all-worldly first noise-armed milk pump" the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not very seriously common music video in order to highlight the freedom of the pumping mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow filled with cows in the background to a song, which contains text lines like: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a pitch on me” or “if you have not noticed it, that's not a Euter, but my breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook site has triggered a controversial on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video stood on mixed reactions among the audiences, many of which say that it is unharmless of the “terrors” of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their kids are taken away within few days of birth," it said in a comment.
Elvie's dairy pump fits thisnt into a still BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Reachable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babys?"
Another person added: “This is an outstanding advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman confessed that you found the song "original".
“I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I had still been silent.
When I was pumped off, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote a person.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertising that is directed to mothers, using milk pumps ( often at work or on toilets) and feels like ‘cow’.
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the discovery that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like milk cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is totally no noise, has no wires or hoses and fits discretely into a silence BH, allowing women to move, keep their babys or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, explained: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it earned a waiting and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the challenges associated with it in the centre and, at the same time, imagine the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This isn't the first time that the pump of Elvie ran into the strikes.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a double mother on the Catwalk, while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly and quietly into a tent city at the border of Texas
The number of internal immigrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings remained relatively the same, among other things there was a sharp rhetoric and the measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to undertake children in maintainers.
Traditionally, most maintainers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become the target disk for an excursion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainer and other adult members of their household would have to deliver their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authority immigration and customs enforcement, explained before the Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had been advocated for the care of uncommitted minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had no previous entries in the criminal register.
“First 80 percent of the persons who are either a maintainer or a member of a household of a maintainer are illegally in the country and a large proportion of them is criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," Albence explained.
In order to deal with the children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodation, require some children to appear within a month rather than 60 days after the arrest before the court, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video-scending and not personally to enter a immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person will be quickly disposed of.
The longer these children remain in preservation, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation employees and reports that have been known in the last month of the system that they are being anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defendants say that these concerns will be strengthened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, as a result of the size, will be easier to overlook.
They also explained that it could strengthen traumas that many of the children already suffer when they were brought into a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to adopt them in friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupational troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war is now in the country in the eighth year.
Moualem, also vice-president Prime Minister, explained that foreign forces are illegally encountered on Syrian ground with the predecession of fighting against terrorism and are “reasoningly treated”.
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the congregation.
Moualem claimed that the “war against the terror” was almost over in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people died and millions more people were disfellowshipped from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned” both by terrorist groups and“every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, which are mainly trained and consulted both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are set against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soil troops in the war-boiled country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return were given and accused “a few western countries” by spreading“irrative fears” to stop refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return," he explained.
"They are politics of a really pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no construction aid was granted to Syria so long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the Opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomas explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebellenhochburg Idlib presents the possibility of leading political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a widely established openness of the Syrian armies supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed its hope that military measures against Djihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front connected with Al-Qaeda, will be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to call up the first meetings of a new committee soon, which consists of government and opposition members in order to design a postwar constitution for Syria and to eliminate the path to elections.
Moualem called the Syrian Government's conditions for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the “reconciliation of the articles of the current Constitution” and warned against immigration.
Why Trump will win his reputation
With this logic, Trump would win his re-selection in 2020, not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an official opinion or a scandal would prematurely terminate its Presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final of a presidency for all times”.
Until now there are no signs of having the viewers sat.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled up to 1.05 million more than that for the best shipping time and has almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best time of shipping, compared to 1.7 million ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the inlet rates of 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
“This is like a fire that the people attract magically because it is something we do not understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the Drama series “Designed Survivor” on the TV broadcaster ABC over a cabinet member who will be president after an attack the capitol is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he brings me to laugh’’” said Scovell to me.
The chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, as opposed to everything that can be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can only provide the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it is also going to be an informed citizen when you are aware of having seen six hours of an expert round, who uses Bob Woodward's sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manaforts 15,000 dollars expensive Bomber jacket from Straußenleder (see Washington Post a "clear piece of self-respect") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rioteric description of trumps, who discusses anatomy.
For my part, I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does, it feels like a reality show that he presents to one every evening," says Brent Montgomery, the main business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of the series “The Three From the Pfand House”, about Trumps rotating occupation and daily actions (a dispute with the Football-Liga NFL break from the Zaun, prize Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a result, or you can't come with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house at the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crushed himself inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't dissolve himself from the screen, not if Judge Kandidat Brett Kavanaugh was shortly in a position to speak to the Senate Justice Committee and to play the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we then made all these crazy missions and the people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Contributions flow the closest races around the congress at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the new boundaries of the electoral districts that led to two employees in the race around the same seat.
The recently newly signed pre-town district in Pittsburg lets the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is acting against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is strongly crossing with the new 17th district.
The cards were resigned after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were destroyed against the Constitution and manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a battle exchange of electoral funding between the large financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a highly observed special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the State.
This seat was held by a Republican over a decade and Trump won ahead with 20 percentage points.
Police experts give the Democrats a light leadership.
The United States checked El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Peking had already recognized without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendship meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama as partners to throw out the Trump Organization Management Team.
Officers of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the leaders of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, says Heather Nauert, speaker of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, it was thought of penalties that were estimated to receive $140 million in 2017 on American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment rates and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar assembly in the previous year and a step forward in the efforts to stop immigrants from moving towards the United States.
In the mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wish the conference to take place and so effectively terminate the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now appointed as a speaker at the conference at mid-October in order to set a sign of the importance of the government of the congregation, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new scratch messages or penalties from Washington.
A government speaker of John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the specialist Robert Mueller on the possible legal disability of Trumps, for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now claims to also examine whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia when he attacks the American elections.
If the majority of the congress changes, Trump faces a body that forces him to account, just at the time when he is prevailing to come back before the electorates; and perhaps before a sworn jury.
These are many ‘which’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or the case of his European pendants, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state war against Hitler if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakes in Munich.
We have failed, and one way fails to avoid the years of the Barbarei who followed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the inconsistent march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just faced with several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump releases the vice-president Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in the kitchen of Devil since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed to record the President secretly and speculate whether the office was inappropriate.
Rosenstein denotes the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a convention that forces tromps to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once had occupied my ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me out 60 years later to inflammate Sabbath-Karts on the table with the cruise cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain in the beginning of the month will put it into a good position for the qualification of the Group G of Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equality to Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jump board for larger.
“This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something of it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but a total disagreement was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we tried in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another large European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult party, since they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure we can carry out this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with all what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the countrywide study indicated to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
“The people want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurancespare.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in time.
Work with your adviser and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial adviser on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenditure.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-sharing life insurance to help cover these costs or self-surance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn off disputes in the last minute.
If you set a precautionary authority so that you are responsible for a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be excluded from expressing them yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who takes financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergy?
Please note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that met on Friday on the Indonesian city of Palu, so the authorities. The number of dead should still increase.
As a result of the emergent communication systems, the assistant forces were not able to receive information from the Donggala Government district, a region north of Palu, closer to the epidemic of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:

The federal lawyer in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight human lives. This is a rare punishment that has been incurred in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a hired pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, while traveling in October on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, travelling footsteps and bicycle drivers.
In order to justify the death penalty, the chargers must prove that Saipov killed the eight of the victims “decisively” and “consciously” severe injuries, says the intention of the inquiry of the death penalty submitted in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Bundesuntersuchungsurlaub Saipov submitted an accusation in 22 points, covering eight assaults of murder against the background of organised crime, usually used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence exercise and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires “final planning and purpose”, the accusators, who described the kind in which Saipov carried out the deeds, as “awful, cruel and devastating”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco harm, pain and losses,” says the explanation.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has no more case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder to two drug suppliers and finally condemned a lifelong penalty in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been deceived two years before the conspiracy of spionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, witnessed in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, so judicial documents.
He admitted before investigators to feel good with what he did, so the police.
Saipov explained that he was inspired in fact after he had looked at videos from ISIS on his phone, so the accusation.
He also urged police statements to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He was not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders who represent Saipov, explained that they are “self-consciously disappointed” because of the decision of the lawyer.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a debt consent in exchange for a lifelong freedom penalty without the possibility of unleasing, will only extend the dream that all stakeholders suffer,” says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had asked the accusation before not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage sworn to mobilise “the power of the people” today during a protest action under the Tories Conference.
The former chief of Ukip explained that politicians must “feel the pressure” of the Euroskeptics, while a member of the Party of Theresa May suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative rear benchman Peter Bone explained to the demonstrator in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "prepared outdoor" if Farage Brexit minister.
The challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of their deeply crushed parties was strengthened by taking part in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems with keeping her compromise plan Chequers on course, despite the attacks of the Brexit advocates, Brexit consignors and the EU.
In spite of the counter-reactions, the bonds were to continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus to force Euroskeptikers and the oppositive Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihul that ‘Chequers belong to the waste’.
He suggested that Farage had been appointed to a peer and should have given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for this, we were already out," he explained.
The Chamber of Wellingborough added: ‘I will admit to the Brexit, but Chequers belong to the waste.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed its opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit-president of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and explained to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unloved in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unloved in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a spice message on May, she continued: ‘Premier Minister keeps her jobs when you keep her promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians must ‘feel pressure’, they should be just in deluding the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, says Farage.
‘They are trying to deceive the Brexit and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘this is not why you come from it’.
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I would like you to let our political class, which is shortly before betraying the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which will bring us to victory in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not independent, self-administering, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit winner marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour anniversary in the city centre.
A few activists grew Banner of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit winners within May's party, which was launched in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun about the Tories, who had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ says Adonis.
'This is a farce.
There is the good Brexit simply not”, he added.

Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team has left the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in the qualifying front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the stall order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and bought vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind vettel, but overhole Hamilton after a button wheel-to-Rad manöver, where the Ferrari pilot rejected the inner side, with the risk of persisting after two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the rear places of the field and lay on his 21th birthday after the end of the first round at place seven.
He was then for a large part of the fastest race, since he stopped on his tyres to stop quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the 44th round and did not make a step in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkones ended as four.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri brought out an excellent performance throughout the weekend and acted as a real gentleman as he should leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of truly bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun on Saturday at a election event about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persuaded not to transmit to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which he condemned sexual abuse to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not speak directly to the Senate justice committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “general, evil and dishonest”.
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has gone before in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and common and wicked and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn't.
I wasn't."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Remember your answer... Did you publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, please.
If we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by following the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein disappears that the leak comes from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," explained Feinstein according to the report by The Hill to the Committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I said to her request for secret.”
Your Dementi seemed not good to the President who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defence of the judge candidate, which is proposed by three women for sexual violations, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to conquer the power with all means.
You see the commonity, the wickedness, they do not care for who they hurt when they let them rattles under the wheels to maintain power and control," the President said, according to the Mediaite.

Flying lots died after he was sure that hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in a plane
A flight lot in Indonesia is celebrated as hero after finding the death to make a plane with hundreds of people start safely on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong descendants are still to feel in the region and many people are caught in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his posts in the strongly varied control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the startway at the time, could be safely removed.
He then jumped out of the Tower when he thought he crashed.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died tomorrow before the helicopter could meet in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to a number of thousands. The National Disaster Protection Authority explained that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of bodies is expected to rise, as many are still under the traits, while others cannot be reached," says the speaker of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves with up to 6 metres height have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute a new hospital car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is low.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and explained in a speech before the military of the country: “I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports of a missing flight crash in Lagune
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagune in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini explained in a communication that until Saturday afternoon they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger.
The Airline indicated that they should cooperate with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The Airline did not answer immediately on requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into water when landing at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officers claimed that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday, six passengers were in the hospital but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact duration of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy both explained that the plane was landing in the Lagune shortly before the landing path.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane fled out of the landing course.
The U.S. Passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to water through jumping water to the emergency exits on the sides of the falling plane.
He said that the flight officers paniced and shouted and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that seafarers who worked close to the improvement of an installation site hurried with a blowable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 persons killed in crashes from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them covered Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The accusation closed her proof on Saturday in the new negotiation of a case in which a man is invoked to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Analytic of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said that he was an expert in the field of information evaluation for hours.
He explained the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period in which he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had said the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said that he had lying, “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at their death time two weeks.
But mobile recordings pointed out that they knew themselves a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis released their news, calls and contact information from his mobile phone some time after Chamber's death.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense will probably begin their plans on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure will then take place on this day before the jury.

Another black?!
New York children's girls complaint couples for a release to "rassist" SMS
A New York children's girl complains a couple because of a discriminatory release after she received a missed message from the mother in which it complained that she was “other a black one”.
The couple decided to be racist and compare the dispute with a 'pressure'.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her disturbance when she found out that the new day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when it came to her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOCH A SWARZE,” Plasco Flexman wrote her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Two times.
After her Fauxpase was recognized, the Plasco Flexman Maurice was unroded and claimed that the enclosed afro-American day mother had done bad work and that she had expected a Philippine, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice complains for compensation for the release and claims compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which she should take over six months of the job for which she was originally booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived in the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do this," she explained the newspaper on Friday, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism claims and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had insulted them, to no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a Rassistin.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was incredible to them, even if it was uncertain?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a “pressure” and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“You want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple in the public were quickly condemned and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put it into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our today's knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the child book, had not had any problem with it, would have been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was “bitter sweet” after his death last year.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as “very important family member”.
"He was a very silent man and didn't praise," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like if you had a child that makes something special: you're proud, even if it wasn't really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Though he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter in Nice was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors forgively tried to save their lives.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to agree with her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines you gave the doctors to keep her heart on pumping sounded slowly off and left her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved about the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who did not get anything from what she did, on board the plane.
"No one knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over the wings all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost families through a suicide strive to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales Maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting offices.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he went suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel like I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had an inflammatory smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smiles could lighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014 Tyler's body was found after suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis has designed the cards “to show the people that there are people to whom you can go and to whom you can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the depth point. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great dream for her, but that she had to: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the sweat while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something that he asked, so a timely and limited investigation, we might be able to get a little intention," said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want investigations from the FBI?
Their willingness can be brought back to the timing alone.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans were badly cut off as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which the present 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to decide at equality of vote and to confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers ‘sink’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overflowers to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who calls on data from the South Korean Reconciliation Ministry, explained that last year 1127 overflowers were registered compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park named more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers than main factors.
Pjøngjang did not express himself publicly.
The majority of the overflowers from the north are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul suggests that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overflowers rather as illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
The relationships between the north and the south, which are still technically seen in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjøngjang on conversations that were about the denuklearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuklearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without be able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to first disarmament us unilaterally," says Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the representative house of Nancy Pelosi called Judge Kandidaten Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was characteristicly inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t discourage the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterical’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement of Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally declared all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed fast and stood in tears shortly before when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a “great and coordinated call murder” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because they showed that he was against democrats.
“I believe that he has declared himself unnecessary with these statements and the way he was thinking about the Clintons and the Democrats,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the representative house.
“I will say so much: if he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his present judge posts," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she is concerned about possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basis decision Roe v. Wade, as it is estimated to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don't need a hysterical person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ah is not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a gun.
It is a sincere hatred, months and years of overcrowding anger, and she won't get it out without crying.
“We weep when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “Mir was helped by a woman who was somewhere manager and said that she was also crying when she became angry but developed a technique. When she becomes angry and begins to cry, she tells the person to whom she said: “You may think that I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keep talking.
I found that brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear reminders is of a former job, in a office dominated by men, where I one day was crying due to an unscriptionable anger and a older woman, a underkyled manager, for whom I was always a little afraid, packed and moved into a staircase.
"Let her never see you're crying," she told me.
“You don't know you're stink saucer.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves, because they believe you to have gone in the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress member of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on its presidential candidates.
In 1987, when hard on board a ship named Monkey Business was captured at an outstanding affair and then moved back his candidatur, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider not the idea of the presidency candidateship.
“It wasn’t a well - thought decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow white and the seven graves’.
Since the election struggle had already been progressed, she was behind the funding and she sweared not to admit if she should not get two million dollars together.
It was an unforeseen fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who don't spend $1000, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech that she announced not to start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the funding and direct addressing of the voters rather than the delegates, as well as the anger of sexism, so that she stood close to the tears.
“You could have assumed that I had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the bagtuch manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember that I wondered what they might write on my grave.
"You wept?"
Why Peking could benefit from trade war between the USA and China
The opening anointings of the trade war between the United States and China were ear devastating. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Peking could benefit from a grave between the countries in a long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warning committee at the beginning of the year when he charged important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with criminal duties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new criminal duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing rejected in the same way every time and recently raised a penalty from five to ten percent on American goods in value of $60 billion.
China swore to respond to any measure of the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon be stumbled.
To move Washington to introduce would mean resignation. However, a public interference against the United States would be much too delightful for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, my experts that when Beijing plays his cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war on the long term by reducing mutual dependency of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulencies in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have recognized before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who concentrates on Asia at the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said:
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country ruined by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem explained that the circumstances in the country are improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to allow normality to come in.
All the conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their everyday and life-bases aimed at.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that there would be no conditions related to aid from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe reached a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the US team with a end of 16,5 to 10,5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has no more won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14,5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his decline on the 16th rail (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Gulf Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and was one of 4 players who achieved a5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Oread from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, Veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player at all times with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t weep, but today I couldn't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the pokal back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," says the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues the fackel to his countryman John Rahm, who won the American Gulf-Landing Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
I am so incredibly proud to have hit Tiger Woods, which I have persecuted since my childhood in the television," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all times, who won 14 important tracks and is only overcome by Jack Nicklaus.
The team of the United States had the whole weekend problems to find the Fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a high-quality performance throughout the tournament.
According to a disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything of it.
Look out for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
