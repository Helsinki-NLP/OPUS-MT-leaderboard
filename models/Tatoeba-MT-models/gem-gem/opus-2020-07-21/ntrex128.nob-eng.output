Walisian parliamentary members do not want to appear as ‘muppeter’
Members of the Wallic National Assembly Assembly House, which are today known during the shortcoming AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wallic Parliament.
Representatives from the whole political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Workers Party explained his group was concerned because ‘the rim on Twp and Pwp.’
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means "duste" and pwp means "bees".
A representative of the Plaid Cymru Wallis Party said that the group in its entirety was "inconsistent" and that they proposed alternatives.
A representative of the whale part of the Conservative Party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to the name of some known docks, is also a British snake word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the whale letter W is expressed in a similar manner as the letter U is expressed in the English Yorkshire dialect, more as an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, who currently develops laws to introduce the change of name, said: ‘It are of course the members who have the last right of destination in respect of their name.’
Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Wallic National Assembly to change its own name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the renaming of the national meeting to the Wallic Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlament Members), but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives propose some other alternatives, but to bring all parties to an agreement may lead to a breach of headline for President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, shall provide a draft legislative proposal for the change of the name in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for discwalification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last voting rights on what to be called when debating the law.
Macedonians go to the electorate to determine whether the country's name is to be changed
On Sunday, the Macedonian people may vote on the change of the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in their territory and has at several occasions contradicted its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum for the change of name, said that he will ignore the vote.
People's vote supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in name is simply the price they need to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The Clocks of St. Martin's Styles – The Cricket in Harlem struggles
"The old ones I talked to have told me that before the time there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Adams.
‘Now there is none of the parts.’
He said the bars were understandable.
‘Persons are being socially interrogated in other ways’ today, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which all regularly visit.’
As regards the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. "And before or later they are back at the starting point."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining places of the neighborhood.
"The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore only accelerate the day when these churches have to close the doors permanently, because it is little likely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodistics assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boikott of dealers at 125th Street – one of Harlem's main hands – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made great damage to the building, and when the father of Johnson's nurse had plans for the reconstruction they bought in a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was “the church clocks of the poor people”.
The expert playing the carillon in July called it something else: «a cultural tax» and «a incomprehensible historical instrument».
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have been initiated by the church's leg people's leadership and others of the Bishop.
The Church Council — the leadership of the congregation, composed of legs — wrote to the Bishop’s judgment in July concerning its concern that the Bishop’s judgment came to ‘try to force the costs’ at the Church Council, despite the fact that the church Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some family children complained about lack of openness from the Bishop's side.
Hai damages thirteen-year-old lobster deck in California
A shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends in about a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and that he and a group of others swimed over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the boy cried out of excitement to have caught a lobster, but he realized at the end that the boy cried 'I was bited!
I was bited!"
His entire bone was screwed up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: 'It's a hai in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transported with air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is presented in critical state.
The type of hai that carried out the attack is unknown.
Bath guard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hailic species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its intake on the United Kingdom's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with tradehouse-like sminking and beauty care shelters, bemanded by specially trained employees.
The expanded sheals are tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a strong entrance in the UK’s 2,8 million beauty care market, which continues to experience growth while the sales figures for clothing and home articles fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempts to find a new scope for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home articles.
Sainsbury's said that they have to double the number of beauty care products they offer for 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shop chain has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have better space in labelled brand areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relanses its Boutique cutting mark with principally veganic products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer The Fragrance Shop should test out the sale table in two Sainsbury shops. One one opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the second is opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local retailers means that supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales are going to look more and more like a cargo, taking up the supermarket fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to upgrade the departments of beauty care and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was discontinued after a dispute on the distribution of the income from the pharmaceuticals in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop capotcher to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury outcare marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care halls to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our selection of brands is designed to cover all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor representing a new trade experience.»
Peter Jones is ‘rassing’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
The Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones will certainly be angry after the TV host Holly Willoughby was withdrawn from a 11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home and accessory mark, Truly.
Your company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) is the program manager of this morning, announced at Instagram that she leaves the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones rage by subtracting from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on its own new gold-shaped contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “graceful” at a delightful meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here the golden girl of the television admitted that the new agreements of her – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time to leave for their clothes and accessories, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brandware, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced at Instagram that she's going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly the first priority of Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security in the next decades.
Everyone's totally shocked that she's chosen to draw.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse stands fult of goods at the mainquarters of Marlow, which is now ready for sale.’»
Experts believe that this Morning programme manager, which is among the most popular stars of the United Kingdom, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as puts and lights,mote and coscows, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-childer mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp in the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman in March.
The two couples go together on vacation, and Jones has 40% ownership in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the M&S trademark ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source that stands Jones closely said yesterday "We won't comment on his business affairs".
Kickcase facts "and so in love"
He knew of the criticism he would receive from the news media for having come with a comment some would regard as "small presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I haven't given away anything.’
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after himself declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great shit on the road to the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s high-level diploma Ri Yong Ho at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, said that North Korea has not seen a ‘similar response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States, instead, still has penalties aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his choosers.
"We're doing very good with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as setting a stop for rocket stars, helping to get released yeasts and to get the lives after American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidentiality, but instead of having 10 000 people outside trying to get into this stacky arena, we would have about 200 people who were right here," said Trump and pointed into the area right in front of them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rages an island and kills hundreds of people
In the cooling water of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organisations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of Lombox residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be submitted.
‘In many cases, they have made it clear that they do not request international assistance, so that it is quite challenging’, explained Sumbung.
The rescue children now put together a team to travel to Palu but are not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the National Crisis Management Unit, said that Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to contribute to the assistance work.
Given the constantly exposed earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is terriblely badly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common view along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of the Palu alerts, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even under the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's fall-by infrastructure to a main point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for the administration of Jokos, which will be to re-elective next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sektaristian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have changed to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and several thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs struggled in the streets with makers, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.

He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can do, so I just tried to give myself as good as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Cante come and touch the ball once and did not think too much about it and just kicked it on."
Chelsea led with 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a measure for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a passing with the slope back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.

We also ask all, in particular the driver, who may have caught something on their car camera, to contact – they may have information essential for our investigation.»
A police speaker has confirmed that the dead woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's concern.
A taxi officer who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial mark that has been drawn into the dispute on ‘rewrite history’
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatic purites.
But the Comwell Society's history team has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "supervisible" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, CEO of the Cromwell Society, says, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to become a goal.
The icon oclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is a proof of the 18th century's opinions and is part of histography for a man many think still deserves to be shouted.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 18th century than today, seen as Parliament's defense against pressure from outside – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate representation, it is still a subject of historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure representing the one side of that conflict.
His performances like Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on its market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, only mentioned with the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered by blood from a wrinkled pulse year near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, the Province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province of China.
He had probably traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the fetter found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby swine pad was open.
He said that inside the swine was there a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
A judicial investigation confirmed according to the report that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
“The legs of my fetter were bloody and maltracted” explained the fetter, mentioned with the surname Wu, in a quote for Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from the monitoring camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 on Thursday to eat his pigs.
His like was found about one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the site, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan’s family and market management are dealing with no compensation for death.
Even if it happens the shield, it's not the first time it's recorded that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a whale farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer’s wife managed to hunt the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to usual, but that the taste of blood may have an excessive effect.
"They just play.
They like to bite, and are very curious ... they don't try to hurt anyone.
You must only show sufficient respect.’
The rest of the orchestra Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the south-west US
As reported, the orchestra Rosa is weakened by moving over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will nevertheless bring flood rain on its journey through North Mexico and Southwest America during the next days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was an orchestra of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tray begins to be shaped over the Pacific and moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northwards to the south-west US.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm downfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the trawl approaching will lead to widespread heavy southwest rain in the next days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm rain will lead to dangerous floods, floating rusk and fast and possible earthquake in the desert.
Deep-tropic humidity will lead to downturn rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsened conditions due to the spread tropical rain.
It's very unwise to move around in the desert to foot as long as there's a threat to tropical decay.
Heavy rain may cause river valves to become widely brushing rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The tray approaching will lead to local strong rain showers for parts of the coast along South Californien.
The total rainfall above 1,3 cm is possible, which may lead to floating rush and fast, and smooth pathways.
This will be the first rainfall of the region.
Some spread tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain later spreads on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corners States on Tuesday and persist all Wednesday.
October can lead to some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States when the Arctic becomes colder but the tropes are very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the Central US on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and East America will probably get a warm start on October, with degrees high on the 20th of Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast American.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be approximately 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, then Thursday's arresting witnesses from the Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual offense that should have occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political feast continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual missions to advertise Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it appeared that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI should carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court election that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he's 100 percent sure this wasn't happening.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculates the average seer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeing numbers were not immediately available to other networks showing the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen usually has problems with measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this number of viewers is equivalent to the end game in American football mastership or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led to among the networks, with an average number of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interests were still large after the hearing.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
The moderate republikan office came with an opinion that he came to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras, trying to take the lift to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and cried to him.
He stood with a lowered look for several minutes while he was scared out, while the event was sent directly at the CNN.
"I stand here right before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the land our truth?"
He was told that "you have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake pointed out that his office has come with an opinion, and said as the lift doors closed that he came to have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the whole Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the accusations against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choice had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans had not enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of "political game" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run 'political games' with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interests of the nation.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.

The police have attacked a man who is suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and intended for deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost its glasses during the basket roof.

After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admits to have shot and killed Wayde.
His caution is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The court doctor of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the death cause is indicated as a shot year in his head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for its working group for the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for the contribution to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU's athlete Joe Alleva thanks to the police force of the area for its ‘hard work and hunting for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returnes per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said that the layer is "crowned" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
"This is what we fear at any time," said Wade.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash that sprays out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighbouring laws of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public etat for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded during one day.
The etat monitored several cases of bulk and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence had a conjunction with the police, while several thousands participated in competing demonstration stations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonian Polarising Resolutionary Assembly.
A group of masked separatists was held back by the rebellion police and bombarded them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Army also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independence demonstrations were standing and cried out ‘Never forget, never forgive’, faced with Unionist demonstrators who cried ‘Long life Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for less damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the release-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was regarded as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separateist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming violation of release, but it was bad to meet because the vote was boiled by most who were opposed to the release.
According to the Catalonian authorities, almost 1000 people were damaged in violent confrontations last year after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Release groups attacked leather in the streets of night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was retained anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prost with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalony's possibility of being independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying of joy over getting voice, but now we sit firm," he said.
Despite having achieved a smal but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalonic independence have had problems with keeping the pressure up this year, as many of their conceived leaders have traveled in self-devoted exile or are in storage while waiting for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is raised by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation becomes more and more appealing’, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras announced, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were imprisoned since late last year, that he should be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To make a choice as a candidate for the European election is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and regression of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.

Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston secured winners
Livinston was surprised to Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's other loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good match from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the Hibernian on the other place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the way away in the Premier League this season and shall play against the leaders of Hearts, which is eight points in front of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home struggle against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unleashed through six struggles in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a struggle after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingstone is losing opportunities against their sleepy guests
Holt's team should have guided long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but bommed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick on after shooting in to meet Craig Halkett head beyond the target.
The host made Rangers play in front of themselves, well aware that they could create problems for their guests at death ball.
And that's how the decisive objective came to be.
Rangers left a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga clear path, and he scored a target from the middle of the box.
Before this stage Rangers had the ball largely all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be inextreme and targeted Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had a almost score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by his feet to the Rangers-keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide card fit.
Crystals still arrived in the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal claims – once after Halkett's protest against the dividend Glenn Middleton, and once for hand – were translated.
‘Fenomenal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all, and they continue to overcome all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got on the top again, but Holt will have a lot of the honor for the way he has strengthened the layer after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall raising through the whole battle.
Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to divorce with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the struggle was labs – they only came into the half of the home team once – and there was a little of a arrival for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiling and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
Things such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU have been disrupted.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security as the reason for a population of 25,000 was not allowed to gather before the mosque, but many attendants met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them curderer – also heard and criticized both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to release him into the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the splid that follows a man who is shouted as a whole of some German Turks and hated as an autocracy by others.
Deptford collision: Hospitality killed in collision with car

The Orca Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be favourable for drying areas)
It is the shield Arizona is taken by a tropical lprint, but it is likely that it will happen early next week, where the remaining force of the orchestra Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and leads to flood dangers.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain weather will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "tier tropical cyclones have maintained the status as a tropical storm or an imprint within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.”
The last National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the centre of the mountain chain Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to be between 2,5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood may Rosa be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flood is a serious problem, some of this decay is likely to be favourable, since Southwest Americans are currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drug Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme dry, which is the next highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa hits lands at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has orchestra strength Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 137 km, is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets cold waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm force Monday evening or afternoon.
The decay over parts of Mexico may be strong and cause great flood dangers.
‘Total precipitation of 7,5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm precipitation’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm to it hit the border of Arizona cruelly Tuesday morning as a tropical relief, which this moves through Arizona and into southern Utah in late Tuesday evening.
“The main hazard expected by Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert in the United States”, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This decay is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid rusk and fast in the desert and soil scourge in mountain areas.

Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered “under the smallness and mind” of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the uncertain and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party’, said Trump before a national meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered “under the smallness and mind” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the congress on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual offense against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also witnessed about his accusation during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday, "the American people saw how brilliant, deep and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote for supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most proper lawyers of our day, with pletty-free vandel in public service," he said a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred discretion to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is that the Republicans vote at the intermediate elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of our most important choices of life.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I'm travelling around and fighting for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats were aimed at ‘resisting and preventing’.
The Senate's first intermediate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to what the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian soil scrap and tsunami, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were pulled out to the sea by huge waves that dunged against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami met the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, then up to six feet high waves thundered into land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and drove many out into the drunk death.
The Tsunami came in the heels of a earthquake with strength 7.5.
“When the tsunamifare occurred yesterday, people still operated on the beach with activities, did not escape immediately and ended as victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of Indonesia’s crisis management etat (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The Tsunami was not alone – it took cars, trees and houses, it hit everything on land”, said Nugroho, and provided that the tsunami had moved over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Somebody climbed into trees to escape from the tsunami and survived.»
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management seta showed many corrupted buildings and stores, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The afterschild continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The account of earthquake could be known by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's stage for assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's position at the end of a long, smal buk may have made the tsunami larger, according to the etat.
Nugroho described the damage as “omtrent” and said that thousands of dwellings, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The likes of some of the victims were found caught in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were damaged and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death figures and damages may be the larger coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely confused, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people there,” said the Red Cross in a press release, allowing their staff and volunteers to be on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it may become much worse.’
On Saturday, the university was strongly criticized not to have informed that a tsunami had taken Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording divided by social media, a man in the top floor of a building is heard crying desperate warnings that the tsunami approaches transpassors on the street below.
In a few minutes a wall of water comes thundering to the beach, and rivers with buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major injury that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aeroplanes by means of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated have still desperate need for food and other needs.
The city Aerodrome is opened only for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo shall visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday after the plan.
Deaths following the tsunami in Indonesia rise more than 800.
It's totally cruel.
World Visions staff from Donggla have come safely to the Palu center, where they have searched for lie under the front of the courtyard, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's totally cruel.
As auxiliary organisations began the dramatic preparations to provide crisis aid, some complained that foreign assistants with much expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad may not be released in a crisis area until it is declared as a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a provinceal disaster’, said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says 'Greit, this is a national disaster' we can open the limits of international assistance, but the situation has not been status yet.'
While the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing that their loved ones should be among the miracles that highlight the dark news picture of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a cloak.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue teams after spending two days caught under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglides for the Asian Legs, which had been carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should bearing," he said.
Gendon told us that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the executives who participated in the Palu beach festival.
But the messages only led to grey hake marks, rather than a few blue hake marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

Kanye West: The Rapper changes his name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance at Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.»
He is one of many known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of bindings and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's joining president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he should never use military power against civilians when the country approaches the 50th anniversary for bloody receptions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “never will ever use the military to undermine the Mexican people”.
Military troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, for a period when left-political student movements turned root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal acts.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they use for research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aimed to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major performance of artificial intelligence would come from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that struck the US's best Othello player, and later was a manager of Microsoft Research or director of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee recognized the former technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state appropriations, according to Lee.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders, that's the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise heads from the universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a degree of artificial intelligence should receive offers of a residence permit automatically," he said.
The China State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other State organisations share money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the American law that aims to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in their referendum on the change of the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sundays on whether to change the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a decade of dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in the Greek territory and has put veto to include them in the NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new naval, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian slave majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boicotting campaign has created doubts if the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the voting party is: ‘Is you for NATO and EU membership, with the approval of the agreement with Greece.’
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country which occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU protective paraply, because it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a large number of parliamentary members have said that they will comply with the results of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-third majority of Parliament.
The state election commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13.00 p.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voted.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and the son of Dushko votes in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors to become members of the NATO and the EU.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who were to boikotte the vote.
"We are positive to the NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a raised head, not being released in the backway," says Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we've valued.
If they do not want to accept ourselves as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of euroasiatic integration.»
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to sore investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think most of them will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to be a member of the EU and the NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He says that a ‘yes’ response will be a ‘confession of our future’.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voting rights will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order to ensure that the referendum is valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle of the pro-west government since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvers beyond the whole Brightons defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton Defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victories on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a measure for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a passing at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran about the race with three Brighton defenders before he came out on the open path.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passing to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used its first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right shoes to hit Brightons keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the network.
‘Aguero still struggles with some foot problems’, said the City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
"We talked about he came to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a measure just then.’
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League battle.
This goal came for 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough passing along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the network just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the road on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff possibilities of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one match in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card-place with a 5-2 victory over National Friday night, but are still looking to ensure their first division title.
Although we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the second team, will be the most likely thing to be the highest level of battle I get on this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not advertised its starting pitcher for Sunday, but shall certainly be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullet session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 matches and lost 7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred discretion to the situation around the highest court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh while talking about how important it is for the Republicans to vote at the intermediate elections.
"All the things we've done are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happens right now.
And they're determined to take the power back at any price, where you see the smallness and the badness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shall not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are aimed at "resisting and preventing".
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "sick and bad and ignorant and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate's court committee and mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, on which the audience bowed high.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.»
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion
When momentum activists in my local party voted to sensur me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a wide range of Labour parliamentary members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I was to be sentenced because I was not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As regards how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, about Europe – ironically enough similar matters that the Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
At the request of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings at Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the atmosphere of many of the meetings, and the promise of 'smoother, friendly' policies is too long forgotten, if it at all began at all.
It is increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Workers Party and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable for the partial leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I earlier thought that I shared many political attitudes with suddenly began expecting me to take a U-swing and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed, they ended with the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't have anything to say what I say – I receive a bunch of bad messages on social media that require me to be disposed of, condemn central policy and tell me that I shouldn't join Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know I'm luckier a few of my colleagues because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sex-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves cry.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross differences have been normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we no longer are such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and any change in the rules of choice becomes the party smaler.
I have received a lot of advice in the last two years when I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise the voice so much, because it will "make everything better".
But that was not why I was involved in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence that had led to my classroom at the public school I went on literally deadly, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councilman and government minister.
I have never hide my political views, nor by previous choice.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have misunderstanded my political attitudes or disagreements with the current management.
To those who presented the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that since the country is raising us against a Brexit who will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and demand of my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to communicate is not to Nottingham Momentum – it's to those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats of settlement or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best carries out their interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbesieged Ayr rises to top
Two late trials have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to victory in this amazing entertaining Tent's Premiership fight.
They're now on the top of the table, and they're the only unowned by the ten.
Finally, it was as much as their superior defence as their ability to use the possibilities they received that led the home to lose the winner, and trainer Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still unquestioned, so I have to be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial in 14 minutes, with the target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the leadership, but a yellow card to the Scottish Landscapeteinen Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, made Melrose compliant with the position, and Jason Baggot performed an experiment without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a punishment park before he, right before break, scored and target parcel a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's trial, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the bears, and from the restart, the Ayr management increased even more ed a trial from Stafford McDowell, with the target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the path to the fullest with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team still came strongly back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have caught the Climo when he had not the ball, MacPherson accomplished a touchdown at the entrance behind the impressive Ayr-maulen.
Climo performanced a target park, as he did again almost completely from restart, after Kyle Rowe picked David Armstrong's box park and sent flakes Gregor Henry for the fifth trials of the home.
Still The Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on the way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as director of a restaurant company with accession.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes manus and plays with his long-term comedie partner, Greg Hemphill.
You have announced that the next ninth season will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that the Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "lively restaurant industry".
‘The garden is ours’: Bolivia, a country without a coastal line, hopes the court will open the road to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol a riggin decked marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazonas are decorated with the motto: ‘We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire country of Bolivia has still freshly remembered the coastal line they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 18th century, and the country is long after once to be able to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, waiting for a notice by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has drivkraft, Community spirit and senselessness, and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court on large-screen in many different places of the country, in the hope that the Court of Haag will give its knowledge in favour of Bolivia's claim that Chile – after several decades of sudden negotiations – is obliged to negotiate on its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s carismatic indigenous president, who is faced with a controversial reselection campaign next year, has also put much on the ability of Monday.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done it.
The United Nations Agency, held in the Netherlands, has no authority allowing them to dispose of chilen land, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the recognition of the International Court comes only six months after hearing the last arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may actually have done things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been resolved by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonist retoric has eliminated any remaining kindness on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it would be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia at Haag, rejected the theory that the judgment of the Court came unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will give "a exceptional opportunity to open a new generation relationship with Chile" and the possibility of "set a stop for 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties".
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, has used the maritime situation as a political shield.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific’, he added.
‘The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.’
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never dispose of its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He encouraged the United States to comply with the promises they gave during a meeting between the leaders of the two contradictory countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to start the fixed atomic diplomacs, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “worn dream” that continued penalties and American resistance are the statement that ends the Korean war ever will force North Korea to knee.
U.S. authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is a widespread doubt about whether Pyongyang really plans to release a arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote shows in Paris reveal the last in huge headsets, which are on the way to a clothes shop near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne decoupled a selection of strange, over-dimensional headplates as part of the SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the moteleves on the moteuca in Paris.
Very unpractic hats have been popular at Instagram in summer, and these designers have sent down the ineviting creatures their catwalk.
Valentino's most enthusiastic plague was an excessive beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewelry-produced watermelones, a trollman hat or even an ananas, but they are not made to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also declined a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had reconstituted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last screaming.
One creative memory of dive equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cooks.
And if you're looking for even more big moth accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be on the way to a clothes store near you.
The over-dimensional hats come straight into the slopes of "La Bomba", the strap hat with a half-meter wide brake that has been viewed on all and everybody, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractic hat that dominated social media have now sent another large creation down the catwalk – a beach laundry that is almost as large as the bath-edract model wearing on it.
The orange raffinadery, which is bordered with raffinains and completed with a white skin handle, was the most ineviting creative in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at moteuca in Paris.
FEMAIL said, “I expect to see big hats and beach cleaners in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact, it would be difficult to overlook the demand for overdimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland fresh schools continue to show academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with enough one year of excellent exam results, which are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30 000 students throughout Scotland, working hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailored school pension, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choices at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands when the words of his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.»
This is a strong reminder that we can not just keep us to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of residuality from freshholes.
Total 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the graduation character A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of the Spanish students also received A.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a decisive skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as professional choices are now valued at the same level as real-fag as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the pensum for fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for the reasons why employers claimed to have problems with occupational vacancies, 17% could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, regardless of what career you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a advance of competition.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were incapable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now essential for today's children.
Getting more languages, in particular those associated with growing economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in the languages that are considered most valuable for the United Kingdom on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested, there will always be a range of languages to choose between in fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish fresh schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equipped them with the knowledge and ability they need to succeed, whatever the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still essential for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication capacity’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence for Scotland youths.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron shall have its Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over to fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers-Trener Luke Walton has advertised that James will play in Sunday's pre-song opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' sex games before season plan.
"I don't need pre-song matches at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a number of voters tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned people meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his selected High Court candidate has been set on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the coming intermediaries, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the elections go to the voters in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's Folk Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at 19.00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia on the web below via direct flowing on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for the highest court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, which is accused of sexual abuses. An expected confirmation vote is set on wait for up to one week while the FBI investigates the matter.
The main objective of all these people meetings is to support republicans who face a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five national meetings in the next few weeks are aimed at ‘generating volunteers and supporters trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Reuters’, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so vital for his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible while moving towards a travel campaign season”, Reuters heard by a Trump campaign person who did not want to be named.
The people's meeting of the evening, which, according to the plan, will take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract support players from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh Press’ according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month of Trump visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senat candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is following the measurements.
"It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift of the measurements," said Simon Haeder, a expert in political science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows a fight spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday single game
After three single sessions, on Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been just that year's Ryder Cup needed.
The turning pendulum of the moment is a fully dictated sport concept, but yet something that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led with six points and now there are four, so we're well carrying it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the path for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 remaining to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the seals again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leader by example.
The deep celebrations became higher as his round continued, and declined to a decisive putting to raise the match to undue when he and Thomas were two below after two.
His putting, who won them the match at 15, was met with a similar cry – of the variety that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is unanimous.
"We really just have to put all the cloths into and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
It's all of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which undoubtedly is Ryder Cup's great success history.
Europe's unusual but glorious pairs have four out of four and do not make a foot wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only couple that escaped a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also escaped bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to move both to and from the vibrant crowd make it clear that they are the largest competitors of the Sunday, and there are no other players in the audience, nor will there be a safe European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everyone prefers both at the same time, in each of his holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-balls-hero, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the nine first holes, the spanjole and the Swedish were so far on the decline that they had no nubbesjans to take the proclamation again.
But on Sunday there's no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to view closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as layers so far, and is far before the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the team of the United States has the battle spirit individually, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe leads 10 to 6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong start at the beginning of Ryder Cup's last day, after the end of the Sunday four-balls and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the lead with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised its score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's four balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't take any of the advance.
Jim Furyk's page must obtain eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who has received four points from his first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated without a sight to beat down Woods and the U.S. smoke Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressive 5&4.
Woods, who stopped through two matches on Saturday, glimpted to inside, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and served a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, which is ranked as number one and three on the world basis.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day with light bris southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who has won majors three times, set the American standards with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fighting 2&1 winner over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, a team has been able to pick up after a four-point propulsion at the start of the single game, but as the current holders only need Furyk's side to achieve unequipped to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best for two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver an attack on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘in no way’ join in unilateral disarmament without trust
On Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that continued penalties strengthened mistrust against the United States, and that the country would in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out “relevant welfare measures” during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, unmounting the nuclear test area and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have nevertheless not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"No confidence in the United States we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not in any circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual degradation, but his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the ‘Atoom Heritage of the Korean Peninsula’, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal end of the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the calls to reduce strict international penalties against North Korea.
‘United States insist on ‘Atoom Heritage First’ and raise the pressure through penalties to achieve their objective by force, and even contradict the ‘Declaration of the end of the war’, according to Ri.
“The belief that penalties can force us to knee is a wish dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that they continued to create further mistrust.»
Ri did not mention the plans of another meeting between Kim and Trump as the U.S. leader stressed before the United Nations earlier a week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, and added: "If the other party in this settlement case was South Korea rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as fixed as it is."
However, the tone for Ri's speech was very different from the last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack against the United States of Fastlands with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Lord Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rakettman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening "full destruction" of North Korea last year, Trump stood before the UN and praised Kim to be courageous enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the penalties must remain applicable to North Korea is nuclear depleted.
On Wednesday Trump saw that he had no timeframe for this, and said that "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, "The Security Council's penalties must still be strictly and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in order to eliminate the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side lines of the United Nations General Assembly, and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had progress, but only hours after charged North Korea, he had come with "ferral requirements".
Nord-Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month to set up a missile area and a nuclear weapon plant if the United States did ‘similar measures’.
He said Kim had said that these "similar measures" he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help the students get more sleep by dealing with the growing uculture to blow through the night with caffeine intakes as fuel.
One academic found out that the students at the best university of the world often did not focus on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after holding a lecture about the effect of sleep lack on learning.
"After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why has no one said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course, starting this year, explains the students how important it is with good sleep habits to perform academic and sports, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students suffered from serious sleep shortage.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom, where students can click on coffee cups, gardines, joggers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think of their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some proudness in being able to blow all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of sleep shortage.
A lot of good sleep should be the “secret weapons” of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep shortage puts the brain in hunger mode, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study programme before they are rolled up at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on a warning when they were to sit as well as when they were to rise and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disturb the day rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Measures of Menga dismisses Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered probably a disappearance when Dolly Mengas target struck Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February's victory 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's other loss of 18 struggles as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and Rangers could never compensate.
Rangers is now falling down at the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind the Hibernian on target difference.
There may be more trouble in yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head damage after an object was thrown from the remote public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which feasted by Ayr and into the Betfred Cup Emificants.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart's last week, and he would have been happy how his routine team hit the opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the battle when Mengas first care sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player wasted the chance.
A long free park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target stand.
Rangers took control, but it seemed as if their game lent more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a punishment park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only got two shots on targets in the first round, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibalys head and a tight kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for the struggle.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the wings player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to make the remote players play exactly the kind of fight they like, where Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers winner Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a punishment park when he ended in conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: the inventor of the geigger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gegers developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a detection that led to the apparatus we today know as the geigar counter.
The Geiger teller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of the popular culture through the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, "What in the whole world is that?"
Rogers: «It's a giant tenteller; it finds radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals.»
Evans: ‘Shall say it makes sound now!’
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention he named, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
The cells can reach ‘se’ a protein common in many cancers and then be injected again in the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promised results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, learning the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered was disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancer forms, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promised vaccine.”
HER2 ‘drive growth of different cancer types’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West, on a MAGA hat, came with a strong defense of Trump after the SNL action.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was bought in a studio at Saturday Night Live after a famlende behavior where he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would still make a choice in 2020.
After bringing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, dressed a Make America Great Again-Hatt, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I'm talking to a white person, and then he says, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I were afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star deceived Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the accusations of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't shipped, West's recording was uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by adding out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard it in the back room about the choice of headplates.
"They mobbed me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They mobbed me!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Will you see that I understand what reality is?" he said, and he said that he should "take the Supermann cap on me, because then no one can say what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL so flaw out reported Variety, where a staff member said: "The whole studio was deadly."
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of our courageousst: TAK TO YOU STAKE IMOT MASSE."
But talk showvert Karen Hunter twisted that West is just "the one he is and it's totally amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art" which I mean cultivating and spraying out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "the crew formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changes the name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, it's dead musical legend Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out against "gift masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordsvinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent imagination series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on movies often makes young men think they must be hard to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic maskulinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married the Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, acknowledged that he was very busy with the theme.
"It concerns me quite much at present – where did the maskulinity go wrong?" he said.
“How have we trained men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the fault for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong maskulin roles.
He continued, "What is inborn and what is allowed?
What is transmitted on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions of today - how can we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.’
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precedent or follower of Game of Thrones when the series is closed next summer, saying he is "finished with battle fields and horses".
From November Kit will play the main role in a new recording by Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a ranker.
The actress recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so that's how something came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-Price-Price series of fantasies.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported a total increase of 14 % in the number of inhabitants living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country, says health representative.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which marks a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by blood transfusion infections.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health personnel at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT environment of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, after each marry with women.
Many of the disease infections are due to insufficient protection of sex in these circumstances.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of an action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that employees leaked data on republikan senators, fnys of ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘conspiratory theories’
Member of the Representatives' House, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday accusations that members of her staff had submitted the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democracy, insured by the claims, was presented by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
“Looks, lies and more absurd lies”, said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and the phone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate of the offense charges against the highest lawyer Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was tracked to the Waters office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
‘This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie’ continued Waters.
"The members of my staff, who have received their identity, personal data and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false accusations, had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie.’;
Waters' opinion was rapidly criticised on the Internet, among others by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is aggressive’, said Fleischer.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be aggressive.
They can't defend them.
They must not bet the motives of the charger.
They must act calmly and understandably."
Fleischer compared Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressively during Thursday consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is working to remove Waters in the intermediate elections, also air its thoughts on Twitter.
‘Store — if true’, he twisted.
In its opinion, Waters said that her office had notified “relevant authorities and the police about these false accusations”.
“We will ensure that the actors are revealed”, she continued, “and they will be held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff”.
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – Blood poor Rowan Atkinson in spy parodie
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit hints in all new films with a British slash and it seems to be relevant for this re-ervaring of the parodifranchisen Johnny English actioncomedie – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-uped in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic suicide about how obviously hopeless we are to become the new export product of the nation?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbled eyes and the rubber face has been renewed its license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking kinopublicum.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dice Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a single note in the music entry with fire wagon theme during the opening ceremony of the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the most forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the last Johnny English race.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical komedie comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely overflowy, especially now that the "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have elements of comedie.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's facades are not as inventive and peeled as the stump film lounges of Mr. Bean.
The preliminary preliminary ruling now is that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the supersecret web network of spies in the United Kingdom and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – a unfortunately little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pompous and defeated figure that already undergos a complete crisis of political inopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this sort of Teresa-May role, but the manus does not give her much to work with.
Her notifying advisers inform that since each active spion has been revealed, she must collect some of the retired.
And that means the clever Johnny English, who is now working to learn at a snucked etablissement, but gives unofficial instruction in secret information, there are some artificial sequences here when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with its old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with an unboat commander, a hysterical superclass lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little disfellowshipped.
So the Batman and the Robin style of rotting everything on the Queen's mission is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko incredibly five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is transferred by the carismatic technology millionaire that claims he can solve the British cyber problems: the luxury Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with far-like sides: dressed as servants they put a guy on a punching French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Voltas luxuryacht; and English triggers the pure anarchie when he trys to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it is then there's a lot that reminds of child TV with the whole thing.
Very medium, it's all.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't think, could the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets used his talent?
Labour denies that they develop plans to make the British work for four days, but be paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party shall assess a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but pay for five.
The batch is likely that business leaders should use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week free.
This will result in a three-day salary of employees while receiving the same wages.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Facilities support the transition to four-day sickness so that the employees can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source of the Labour Party said The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen during the night, but the four-day week is an ambition that matches the party's wish to let the pendel turn to the benefit of the workers — in addition to the overall industrial strategy of the party’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day sickness during the campaign before the parliamentary election in 2017.
However, the tank is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A speaker for Labour said: "A four-day-sick is not the party's policy, and is not an assessment by the party."
Financial policy speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘promotors’ of public service providers.
The plans of the Shadow Cancer also mean that the current shareholders in aquatic companies are at risk of not getting back the entire share item because a Labour government may ‘subtract’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the management of companies and set up employees funds to transfer 10 % of equity to private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI review of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has undergone a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of the finding of the Agency may cause some Republican senators to change their vision.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the republikan senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would cause them to change their senses.
Kennedy was more open to it than the South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and asked, "Do you?
He was firm, shiny, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be cut in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it had to be an enthusiastic discovery," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energyfully," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could not confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is the New York host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to act and a similarly impressive assignment; eradicated the poverty of the world.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flow to the great plenary of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, starting in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people actively work against poverty.
In order to get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to carry out a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, send mail to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness about their goals of eradication of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to make people fight for changes, or just a case of so-called "clicktivism" -- that people feel great by signing a online signature campaign or sending a twot?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from the trailers, with a wide range of different objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and notices resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has had a direct impact for nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main engagediments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to "help children to exploit their full potential", and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the eradication of miserable nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 twotes from Global Citizens.
"With support from the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens as you, we can make the social injustice with underernähring to a footnote in the history," said the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom in order to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government published the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important citizens' rights and the anti-apart movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, are some of the artists who act on the year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as a ‘blocked’ to prevent Russian energy sports - the Ministry of Industry
Washington may ‘if necessary’ to the marine in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US domestic minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating after the invitation of the legal government – is a deficit to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the Southern Flanken of Europe," he must have said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
‘The US has the possibility to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the arrangement held by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiles itself as the ‘the voice of the energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far on their way.
‘The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with a economy that depends on fossil fuel.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
Consequently, employees of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The Nord-European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘catch’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gas flow capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a pure economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is only motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unreasonable competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a press tool and that consumers should be able to choose supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has encountered resistance from Germany, which has re-evaluated its commitments in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries that intervene in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI after a recent meeting between the German Cancer Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘think serious’ on its presidential candidate for 2020, says senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think seriously" if she would still as a president after the intermediate elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wants to be silent.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix the chess-headed government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said, "The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I would like to consider seriously whether I should ask as a president’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump at the election meeting and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm quite concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a twoth on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI review before the vote."
However, an opinion measurement published on Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own choosers do not believe that it should still in 2020.
58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to an opinion measurement from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The measurement showed higher support to former governor Deval Patrick and 38 % supported a possible candidate and 48 % was against it.
Other high-profiled democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidate tour in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Bide said he would decide officially by January, announced Associated Press.
Sarah Palin pointer Track Palins PTSD during Trumps Selective Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being deceived in the sept.
He was arrested and intended for a home violence event Monday evening
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers with her," she told the audience at a choice arrangement for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about the son and other war veterans: "They come home a bit changed, they come home the shepherd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and aimed for violence in the home of a woman, discussing a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police in Wasilla.
18 countries and D.C. support tests of new asylum policies
eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims as refugees from gentle or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 countries and D.C. submitted an orientation from amicus curiae (the friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case which the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent repentant sons” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have considerable problems with genus and home violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision by the Anchor Court of Immigrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum from home violence.
President Karl Racine, District of Columbia, said in an opinion on Friday that the new policy "was disappearing many decades with state, federal and international law".
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition contradicts that principle’, said the orientation from amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused immigrants access damages the American economy and says that there is a great probability that they become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary labour force”.
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims as refugees from home violence and refugee in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave the homeland because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political viewpoint’, said Sessions in the notice of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never intended to reduce all problems – even all serious problems – people face every day around the world.
Desperate survival action in Palu – the death figures are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly worse.
"It was very excited," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-sick son at an evacuation center in the confined city of Palu.
‘The whole time you see ambulances that get the dead.
Pure water is inadequate’.
You could see residents who came to ruined homes and lightened through water damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were damaged and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had strength 7,5, were filled.
Some of them damaged, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing strong aftersilence.
He gets tears in his eyes when he repeats how it felt when the violent earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves in security.
I was knocked by the wall that breaked together, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, and added that the family was in the city to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife cry about help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're in security."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of ‘trakassering’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper drived a four-page ad in an American newspaper that scared the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China Beijing accused of using American presses to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the Annex China Daily paid to enter the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China to try to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the elections in the United States, marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said American officials according to Reuters.
However, it is normal that foreign authorities use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds with new customs rates on each other's import products.
China's penalty duty in the early trade war would affect export companies in countries such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador of China and formerly many-year governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the trakassering by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register”, wrote Branstad.
"As a contrast – at the aviskiosken on the street here in Beijing, you will not find many different opinions and will not be able to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China's problematic economic course, given that the media are below the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female electors before the intermediate choice with the Kavanaugh facade, warn analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest legal candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several accusations of sexual abuse against themselves, analytics warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) suggests a FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to calm up sint choosers.
"Women will not forget the events of yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the Progressive MoveOn Group last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while they demonstrated the courses of the Senate when the Republicans who control the justice committee chose to go on with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Demokratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"The people say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's insecure electors in the forests and younger electors between 18 and 29 years, which often fail to vote even if they dislike the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence that provided detailed description of the accusations of sexual infringements against the High Court Candidate, analysts considered that there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans were forced through the appointment.
‘This has become a salvious root of the Republican Party’, said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being put in place – it is also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it’, pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the electoral of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over whom they should believe in the cooling waters of Fords and Kavanaugh's witness statements, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the respondents were fully or quite convinced of Ford's witness charge, while 35% said they were fully or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under their certificate, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the flake play, the FBI is going to investigate the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other charger, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's Justice Committee during the last week, that Kavanaugh was in a drunk state, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the highest legal candidate exposed her his genitals while at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruption, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spoke that the purpose is “world dominance”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store online" or a POD.

Bernard Water: Feiring of Victoria Cross receivers from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was assigned a Victoria Cross during the first World War as a fighter, was celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Colonel Luitenant and prest Bernard Watn were awarded the honorary statement on 29 September 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniffskytt four days afterwards and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military explanation.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Watn, said it was a "fleet symbolic" that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's price-winning taste.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Luitenant Water led its batalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under strong protection from field canons and machine weapons”.
Later he run to the shot line and guided the line "with great courage" forward before he stormed a field canon independently and struck out three of the departments.
Colonel Watn was killed by a German snikskytt on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the war was over.
Michael Vand, 72, said that the acts of the grandfather were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble."
He and the brother Dr. James Watn also put a crane down after the parade, which was guided by the Brentwood Imperial corpse.
Michael Watn said "he felt very honored to play a role in the parade," and added, "the braveness of a real whole is demonstrated by the support from many people".
MMA trailers were up all night to see the battle sports program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Forget that you've kept awake all night to see the close Bellator 206, just to discover that you don't see the main struggle.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the sighters of the United Kingdom were crushed when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the battle.
A follower described the transition to the child programme on Twitter as “a kind of sick ghost”.
‘The State regulation is that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00, so they had to switch to child programmes’, said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice-president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for the consignment.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work with the mission plan to include the viewers of Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the purpose of the fight," said Coker.
"But it's at 6:00 in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Faith with-- when we switched, many messages went forward and back, and they weren't exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was an authority thing.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far from the trailers, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lessworthy in sexuality
The Olympic stuper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of minority to everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before at the school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was standing up for the rights of the homofiles to give others "hop".
He also said that being a parent made him less care about wining OL.
The ordinary program manager of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone a few months due to disease.
Daley appeared to be a little away from the Lavers' first consignment and said he felt "less worth" than any other one he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "For this day, these feelings of being lessworthy and different have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he "was something," he said, so he didn't disappoint all when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-fold bronze winner in OL and has become a high-profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in the year's co-course particles in Australia to appeal to decriminalise homosexuality in several countries.
He said he's standing forward because he feels lucky that can live open without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times world champion said that he loved a man - film creatures Dustin Lance Black from the United States, who he met in 2013 - "wondered me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, which is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference never had been a problem.
"When you undergo so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and downturns.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything turned out that I only had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medal in OL.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him that he would not live long enough to sit in the first row," he said.
"I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The year after that, Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed about the whole life -- to stumble in front of a home public under OL, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - that meant much for him in the run before OL and still gives him gazehud.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Form weak Mickelson taken out until golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will be hitting a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Clears Cup battle, but he's got to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12 times, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he had so often been for the United States, it divides five times the major winner the day between being a highman and working with his game in the rank in the hope of fixing what cuts.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even on the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National-bana, where the long raw-area still punishes miserable strokes.
And if the course in itself is not terrible enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth battle on Sunday, the very British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their struggles this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a klapp on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I probably didn't see that he was going to play two matches.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldos record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Cleaner Cup career that has never completely reached up to his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven odds, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, mad and likes to drive ferry with others. He's a great guy to have in the layer room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game."
European Law captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European law captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the end of the last day single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point leadership over the Americans, but cared for the winner with a minimum margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still remember that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, photographed after having seen the class of 2018 wins 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leads 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you've got the scores on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golf players in the world."
Bears are very happy about how his players have succeeded in the tough golf course and adds: "I couldn't do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that are in the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances as golf player are tested to the full.
That's the message you have to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also needs to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players provide better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great transformations last day. He was on the winner team at Brookline before he ended up as a loss when Europe carried out the "Miracle at Medinah".
I remember every condemned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle fights.
We then arrange our configuration and send the people out in the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top battle, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjørn about their choices of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
German Marine's latest fregat would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the cold war, but it will not happen until the early next year due to failure systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the drivership of the entire new fregatten in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have been surrendered in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the marine ordered back in 2007 will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a strong canon, a number of anti-air and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest fregates for up to two years away from the home port.
Sudden delays, however, means that the advanced warships – they were told to give Germany strength on the sea – will already be deprecated before they are put in service, reports Die Zeit.
The destiny F125 fregate created headings last year, when German marine officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important 'software and hardware deficiencies' which made the warship unusable in a battle mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew on older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also detected that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the possibility of the marine to perform upgrading in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price note of the entire project – including training of the crew – has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a diminishing EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems around the new fregates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine strength is lowering.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Head of the Defence Committee of the German Government, confirmed that the Marine is actually "inches for applicable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were arranged, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the fregatten in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust Heavens on the secret lives of the flager museums
New research carried out by a country property in the Scottish High Country shall reveal how flager mouse uses the landscape in the hunting for food.
It is hoped that findings will relight the behavior of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future preservation measures.
The study for researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flags and dwarf flags, as well as brownlanera and water flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flager mouse activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of flager mushrooms and the species that do what.
There will then be a habitat map and a report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of habitats most important for flager mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of beetmarks and the best way to maintain the forest for flager mice and other associated species.
The flagsmus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects infants and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting may also constitute a risk, the same with flue paper and certain chemically processed building materials as well as cave tax attacks.
In fact, the flager mice is not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes in catching exchanges.
They use advanced eco-location to find insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares around the country, takes the flager mice very seriously.
They have ten good experts regularly conducting surveys, monitoring of petitions and amongst life-saving work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only its own flager mice reserve at Threave landing in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland ten flager mice species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a perfect area for flager mouse," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the flager mouse, so the work we do here and by other properties will help us understand more about what they need to trives."
He emphasizes the importance of monitoring the flager mice before maintenance on an property since the undue destruction of a single petition can kill up to 400 females and young people, and may be to eradicate a whole local population.
Flag mice is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, trakassers or disturb them or destroy their petitions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of Bat Conservation Trust, invited the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flager museums, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the assured charges while lawyers will appeal to German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the assault prosecutors against themselves as "false news" and says that people "want their fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will appeal to the German newsmagasin Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raising an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 in the afternoon for keeping close to the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followed a few hours after the charges were reported, 33 years old Ronaldo rejected the charges as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times wins the Goldball into the camera.
‘They want a fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want their fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldos lawyers are prepared to appeal to Der Spiegel because of the claims, which they have called "a unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for ‘recognition damage to a extent equivalent to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of privacy in recent years’.
The claimed event must have taken place in June 2009 on a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the soccer player's room, where he is supposed to have raped her anointed, according to documents submitted to the Court of District in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knees after the claimed event and told her he was "99% a good man" which was failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were pictures of her damage in hospitals, but later they incurred outside the court because she was "leavened for revenge" and was also concerned about "become publicly dispensed".
The 34-year-old she is now trying to make the difference because she is still traumatic after the claimed event.
Ronaldo was on the tip to go over from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the claimable violation, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom ‘will sleep forever’ to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will ‘sue forever’ if they lose the status as world leader in automotive production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “angry” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed cross-border passing at any Brexit without agreement may mean less jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"Where the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, the Executive Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern concerns about what the car manufacturers say is supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘purchase order’ and each 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is ‘president established to avoid such checks at the border’.
"We need to have an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that makes us, as I say, not just enjoy success at the moment, but that we take this opportunity," he said at the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increased long-term costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, after each, result in job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are increasingly concerned: "My experience indicates that when these jobs are disappeared, they will never come back."
A spokesperson from the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be exposed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's destiny meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein may be “exposed one more week” while the fight around the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump assistants and Russia, as well as possible obstacles to judicial exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Vice-President or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, have for many months run up during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of entering the conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president based on the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that it was about to subtract voluntaryly.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said, "he would mostly release" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid conflicting with Senate's Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
At the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized that it could be a week's suspension because of everything that happens with the highest law.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will argue that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The programvert Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to contradictions against the “self-guiltness” of television reports, even though she added: “I do not agree that they are self-good”.
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
‘The President makes more questionnaires than any former presidents’, she said and added without proofing: ‘We have looked at the numbers’;
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the past weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open facilities or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he took a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior before a lot of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland NHS in order to express the gratitude of the country and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish parliamentary member, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom had to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of the application for residence and employment permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: ‘The United Kingdom and the EU negotiations on the release have been held through the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I see this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from the whole of the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and competence that strengthen and improve the work on the healthcare services to the best for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we hope you will be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent operation after head damage
Defence player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, carried out an urgent operation after having had a head damage during Saturday 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee States' main trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the side and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a bar and brought him back for further investigation.
A functionary from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘are no information available on the type/volume of the damage yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five cabs on Saturday before he ended the battle, which gives a total of 18 cabs for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying an property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
Document tax increase will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts at the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds per year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of the plan of Jeremy Corbyn to attract young choosers with a commitment to offer more reasonable dwellings and to provide high-income groups.
The increase in the taxation of documents will be charged to persons and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will strengthen government action to remedy the situation of homeless people.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher fee introduced two years ago on dwelling number two and rental rental purchases – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to spend up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built property in London is purchased by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get the foot in the living market.
Many prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the many foreign buyers who are mostly outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson presented proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own dwelling.
He accused large construction companies to keep the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May rejected allowances for reasonable housing in order to solve the United Kingdom’s ‘schaady housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an overlooking series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give the municipal governments greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "I said last year I would take my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means to find solutions for our degraded housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be so easy for people who are not living in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to buy homes as it is too hard working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of own dwelling has become too far, and the invaluable situation for the homeless persists."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become a Scottish manager before or since.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of reliving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as football player.
I got a B-caps and that was it," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports sound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that option would only come if I succeeded in the club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic Manager says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the great club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, the uncertainly Premier League belongs," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the leadership for three years, after a period of assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' training loss.
Then he helped Alloa return from deprecated to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of decline to win the master title of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the play career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was likely a proper road separation”, he remembered when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought that management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine height points.
But football games may be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it with regard to stress and pressure in the job, but management feels quite right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it, it feels like the most comfortable thing I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows study
The summer's heat wave has strengthened the income of the UK's hard-pressed pub, but let more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced a sales increase of 2,7 % in July – while the income for restaurants fell 4,8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a company consultant CGA, summarised the figures, said: “Continue the sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when the pubs increased 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1,8 % in the restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger equal-for-like than that restaurants fell.
Pubers with food servering also had trouble with the sun, even though it wasn't as dramatic as for the racing drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
In the case of chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6,6 % that month, with food serving decreased 3 %’.
Paul Newman, analyzer from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the main factors in placing on the market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a turnover of 4,8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have arrived at a worse time for food service holdings and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide an extended breathing room."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the braking in rolling out of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, commercial market controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – has secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows study
A study of 20 000 adolescents covered pages with ‘fax Insta’.
The news has increased the concerns for the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘main account’ which they show the parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A 20 000 school student survey revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to Instagram image sharing pages.
The news has increased the concerns for the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent ‘head account’ which they refer to their parents, while having other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret ago to her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "move me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC conference for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is terrible that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘Right of Freedom Advocates’ in Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-exercising role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated free sports practitioner, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to get an insight into her extensive experience in internationally over the past 10 years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide free sports environment, and we are sure that free sporters in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to act as a voice for free sporters, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters under OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold. She is now firm BBC expert, and after having a transient ice-chemical attack, she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter, "A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that just the time will show if I want to be residual and to what degree.
It's been hard work, but I'm quite good again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing smooth exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!»
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows splits the opinion on the web
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the web with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump carried close to the body”, Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer products, a fresh and flirting music video inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cave full of high and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any hail" and "In the case you didn't understand it, this is not jur, that's my puppies."
The choir continues: "Pull it out, pump it out, I feed my babys, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it cutting the "greatnesses" in the maize.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and food to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump is fine in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course traumatic for both mother and baby.
But -- hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babys?»
Another added: ‘For a failure ad’.
Others defend the ad. a woman admitted that she thinks the song is "unbelievable funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like one if I still was breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genial product," it was one who wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a fun ad addressed to mothers such as pumps ( often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that shields or judges the maize.’;
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bh.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets fine in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, commented: ‘The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provoking launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put search lights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertaining and recognisable way we show the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
Under London Fashion Week, a tobacco mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of arrested migrant children has gone even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard retoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by arriving and making demands for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other household adults were required to give fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a chief official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of persons seeking to be supporters of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested persons had no previous criminal leaflets.
‘At least 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them is criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecution these people," says Albence.
The officers are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules which suggest that some of them must meet in the court within one month of arrest and not 60 days which were the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be presented through video conference instead of meeting personally in order to conduct their residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in maintenance, the greater the risk of being anxious or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receiving workers and reports that have appeared in the past months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger installation such as Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked due to the size of the installation.
They added that the movement of children to the tent camp without having sufficient time to prepare themselves emotionally or to take a goodbye with friends can strengthen traumas that many already have to do with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish "occupational powers" to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also acts as Minister of State, said that the foreign forces remained illegal on Syrian soil while covering the fight against terrorism and “will be treated thereafter”.
‘They must withdraw immediately and without condition’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terror is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on flight.
He said that Damaskus will continue to "keep this sacred struggle until we have cleaned all Syrian territories" both for terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the wary country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are so good that they can return, and he accused “wise western countries” to“precedential irrational refugee” that causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have addressed the international society and humanitarian organisations to organise these returnations," he said.
They police what is really a humanitarian situation."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction of Syria before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a buffer zone in the last major defence position of rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action will be directed to jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, which will be ‘extinguished’.
The United Nations Sentinel Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to call on the first meetings of a new committee consisting of State and oppositional members to draw up a postwar base for Syria and to run the path for new elections.
Moualem provided conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted to ‘the review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-choosing in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, rich and scandals would end the presidentship before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidentship ever!”
At the moment there are no signs of seerright.
Since 2014, the best-time seer figures have doubled more than 1,05 million in CNN and almost threefolded to 1,6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best shipping time, from 1.7 million for four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers at night with great news.
"This is a fire attracted by people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognised comediemaker and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, as opposed to anything else on TV, the actions acting in Washington may determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reconciled and the health of the global economy.
Discount is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you get sitting for six hours to follow a panel with experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dip thickness in the background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with strut feather worth $15,000 ("a plate reflected with hybris", said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, uh ..., anatomi.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump show's varying role crew and daily turn on the plot (crushed with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he burried in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the past and people said this is the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most regular intermediate choices to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district experiences a flow of money after a conversion of a congress district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting about the same seat.
This newly cultivated suburban district in Pittsburg represents the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was revoked after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a fundamental manipulation of the electoral circuits of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on campaign financing between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Demokratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a closely followed supplation choice for Pennsylvania's 18th district to the Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a small leadership.
U.S. Assessed penalties against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomatics noted that the Dominic Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
Officers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the US diplomates from El Salvador, the Dominic Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the ministerial speaker, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $40 million in U.S. assistance in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which were cutting financial assistance and targeted indicator restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and killing figures.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a conference on top that focused on safety and economic growth to follow up a similar collection that was considered as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid-September, however, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans of criminal action against El Salvador.
The Vice President Mike Pence is now entitled to speak to the conference, which is now planned in the middle of October, to show the importance of the administration adds to the collection, said the diploma.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or punishment measures from Washington.
A speaker at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomates, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next spike in the box may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to judicial exercise, which is now very solid evidence of in public documents.
Mueller is also in the process of expanding the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our choices.
If the Congress would change side, Trump would be responsible in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the elections again and perhaps at last a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe to claim that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We must all be selected on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, if only the west had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and lost the possibility of avoiding the years of blood bath that followed.
The time of history turns around such turning points, and the unreasonable March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are faced with several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's review?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather since this newspaper reported that he proposed secret hearings of the president last year and wondered that he was inappropriate to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times' production is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently initiated FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the highest law despite credible assaults and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote under the intermediate election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we don't stand these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I had in Praha.
My mother was a Chickoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me abroad to tend Sabbath lights on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be looking optimistic on our future?»

Rangers' Graham Dorran optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accepts Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive unresolution struggle in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from group G in the European League.
A knee damage prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from doing his first appearance for the season in the resolute fight 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jump board to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good layer," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get to something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nicked at the end, but uncertainly was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday there will probably be a great evening in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it'll be hard because they had a good result in the last match, but with the home public in my back, I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely hard, between everything that happened to my damage and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys enjoy; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the last season behind us and get it to it."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear formation of how they wanted to be handled, few were talking to the family about it.
Approximately half of the people in the National Wide Study said they talked to the spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
‘The people want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation’, said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Activities.
That's how you get started.
Talk to the husband and children: You can't prepare the family to care if you don't say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the advisor and the family where and how the custom should be given, because such choices may be of great importance to determine the costs.
Take your economic advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenditure.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to contribute to covering these expenditure or self-assurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear out of legal problems immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care and assuring that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some power over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make economic decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Think that your old parents have a medical emergency situation and are on their way to hospitals.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write the details of a summary so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake – who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place’.

His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have inquired witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death figures are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from Donggala regentship, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggla on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a tang bucket on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggla is a regeneration stretching along more than 300 km with a coastline in the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regentship, a administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the beams of the central province of Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggla.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, at the coast of the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggla have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the administration of emergency aid in Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met western Donggla in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Ilration in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquake.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province at Sumatra 26 December, triggered a tsunami hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with strength 6,8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck in the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake with strength 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that rashed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A grunt earthquake hit the rulership of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while humans were reminded of the crops of the deadly earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by coincident buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and led to the temporary beach of thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palins oldest son arrested by charges of violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after attack prosecutors.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspicion of violence at home, discussing with a report on violence at home and contraception of arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the claimed violation.
Palin will be invented in Mat-Su inventory prison and arrested for an unsafe debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "no guilty, absolute" when he was asked how to address the debt question, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three infringements of class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and penalty of $250,000.
He has also been accused of an infringement of class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a penalty of $2000.
It is not the first time it has been made a view to Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attack on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the claimable attack.
The case is carried out in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was aimed at violence at home, discussing the report on violence at home and holding a weapon while being drunk in connection with the event.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after having linked the son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after Iraq’s service.
Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people are killed after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with strength 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are low and death rates are expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dunked across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York who killed eight persons – a rare penalty that has not been exercised in the State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, used a rental car from Home Depot to accomplish an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he pitched down footers and hospitalists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution authority must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘deliberately’ and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to the notification of the purpose of seeking death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal great jury 22 point appeal, including eight targets for the killing of money pressure, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a target for violence and vehicle rejection.
The attack required "beacious planning and delay", said the actor, which described the way Saipov carried it out as "heavily, cruel and deceased".
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’ states the notification on the plan.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time Southern District of New York led a thing that could give death punishment.
Advocates, Khalid Barnes, were sentenced to have murdered two drug sellers, but were finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, a couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy for performing spionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no anger in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after having seen ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to the aim.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the appeal of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “approved disappointed” over the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to apply for death penalty instead of accepting a confession and lifetime in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the traumas of these events for all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the army of the people’ today during a demonstration during the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be given the ‘pushing’ of the eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstrations that if Farage was the Brexit secretary, the United Kingdom would have been "extinguished".
But the challenge for May to forgive its deeply divided series has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State struggles to keep his Brexit plan on the track against attacks from Brexites, Remains and the EU.
Her support players insisted that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the back-up – and force Euro-skeptikers and Labour to choose between her package and ‘kaos’.
Bone told the Solihol demonstrations that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and received responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When he would explain his resistance to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone defeated claims that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The intention that the British people have changed their opinion and wish to remain in the EU is absolutely wrong’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Minister of State, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unopular in the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually those who are tracing the streets and get us selected in the first round.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: ‘State Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage said that the politicians would feel "the pressure" if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken at the public vote in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the viip to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-controlling, proud United Kingdom."
At the time, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political collection in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists ventilated with Tories Against Brexit-banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour Member Lord Adonis hated the conservatives of the safety problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"This are those who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
‘It is a complete hazard.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers seriously to be a presidency candidate
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to evaluate seriously as a president's candidate after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a council meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticist of President Donald Trump, reconciles the republikan representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central in the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the council format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to be a president's candidate.
Warren replied that it's time that "women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrestation after the death of Sims from LSU by shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot wound in his head and died as a result of it,” said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was on the spot and had weapons with him.
Simpson was arrested without insistance and was in charge of East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two meters high youth that grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returnes per battle.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims into the world master title after the battle order gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Botta's qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stall order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and celebrated nearest Hamilton of the course while he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel run into the depot first and let Hamilton continue running in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver unwillingly let the inside free after a double passing to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and entered as paragraph seven at the end of the first round of his 21th anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while he was on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overcome the Kimi Raikkonen that was lying as number four.
He finally came into the depot of 44th round, but couldn't increase the rate of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkone took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekends and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a good two-piece," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump spotted senator Dianne Feinstein under a political arrangement on Saturday for her holding that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not direct refer to Ford's certificates before the Senate's Justice Committee. He commented instead that what happened in the Senate shows that people are "indignant, arrogant, and speaking insane".
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind when you see people who are mad and poor and arrogant and speak unhappy," he said.
"When you look at deliverys and leakages, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked.’»
Hey, wait a minute.
Let's play... no, we didn't leak, he added, with a simulation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent to the letter with detailed information about the accusations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leakage came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidentially, as she asked."
But her denial was not delighted by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the party event, "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the Supreme Candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control," said the President according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer received two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-target management early through the shot of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored Giants management.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals of Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League tape for the season of Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting for the season between the laws, and Giants had won the three previous fights.
Dwyer's opening came for the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave up the game when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownies' compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at a break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard reconciled once again with a masterly target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the battle late in second round, and he secured the winner with the team's five-half-way in the final round.
Giants, who has now lost four of the last five matches, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Flight leaders die to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is sheltered as after he died and ensured that an aeroplane that had many hundred passengers safely could take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit the Sulawesi island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftersquake continues to terrorize the area, and many are caught in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had flights for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave their post in the strongly sweating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He was standing to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely facilitate.
Then he jumped out of the control Tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in a hospital.
Talkman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australias ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him today morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death figures may rise to thousands, and the country's disaster preparation body reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to increase further since many bodies are still caught under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach’, said the speaker of the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet high waves have angry Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: “The whole time you see ambulances that get the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are ranched everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works febrillish to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Fly crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed in lagune
The airline that owned the aeroplane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific of Micronesia now says that one man is missing; they previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the falling aeroplane.
Air Niugini said in a press message that on Saturday afternoon it was one male passenger they had no overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The carrier did not answer immediately on the request for more details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, servants said seven people had been transferred to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the state of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the aeroplane landed in the lagoon right outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane blowed on the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wheat through the middle deep water to the emergency exit of the declined plane.
He said the airplanes had panic and shout, and he had a smaller head damage.
U.S. Navy said seafarers who worked nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using a blowing boat to transport people in land before the plane fell about 30 metres below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggest that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics put the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors terminated the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
USA Analytics at the Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as experts in the field of information analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle together the movements of 29 years old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which struggled against what he had claimed before, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at the same place as the cell phone to the Chambers at the time he claimed to be with the friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went in the witness box Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked Tellis to speak true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was "laughing because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said a little after Chambers' death, dropped Tellis calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defense shall begin on Sunday after the plan.
The judge said he expected that the case would be left the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what's socially engaged hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origin of political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make socially engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new flower in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's passports in New York inquiries pairs for rejection after ‘racist’ message
A childpasser in New York appeals to a couple of discriminatory objections after receiving an error message from the mother, who complained that she was "and a black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the target of ‘expressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-children mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new child-passer, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEII ENDA A SWARD PERSON’, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, there was a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who said up to Maurice, claiming that their dismissed child-passer, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the par for compensation for the cancellation and demands compensation in size order 350 dollars per day for the six months long, losji-based scheme she was promised, but without contract.
"I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don't," she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has turned back against the accusations that they are racial and say the statement of Maurice was the only right thing, since they didn't feel they could trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she hadn't meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been inconvenient against, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the target of ‘expressing’ says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to date and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is there such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly nice," added the share maker.
While the legal matter goes on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple of social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The author of Paddington feared that the readers wouldn't accept a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says to the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the child book of a small bear, would have been very happy that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was 'bitter sweet' after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father in secret was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no scared person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who makes a good: you are proud of it even if it really is not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
At landing, the daughter would be hurried to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked forgively to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the bodies in the body klapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, in certainty that it happened.
I couldn't shout and shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning over the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know of the tests she went through.
"No one knew," she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran into a smooth stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postal cards with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their dear in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up post cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers follk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promised cook with an infecting smile.
"All knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could lighten up any room."
He stopped his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm constantly worried that there will be an infectious effect."
Sharon made the cards "to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself--you must talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell him that he felt downward or depressed or something," she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the change in mind.
The first Christmas day he was completely in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas, they did not reach eye contact or anything’.
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it, "It screws up a big hole in the family.
It breaks us.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts researching
"I thought that if we could get to any of the things he asked for – a time- and scale-limited examination – we might come to a certain agreement," said Flake on Saturday, and he feared that the committee “fold from one another” along fixed lot limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The opposition was due to the timing.
The choices are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be much more difficult for them to get the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called to senators and operated lobby business to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where it is currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him put in the highest law.
The number of North Korean "fallers" under Kim
The number of North Korean gates to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, proclaimed a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-Seug, referring to data from South Korea's Ministry of Collection, said that there had been 1127 springs last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human sellers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most afhearers from North Korea are subsequently offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees through China, which have the highest border to North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China views the hopes as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South – which is still technically in war – has improved considerably in recent months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang were meeting for discussions about the negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States penalties for lack of progress since then.
"No confidence in the United States there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will rest one-sidedly first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to sit in the highest court
Minority leader of the Representatives' House, Nancy Pelosi, called the High Court Scandinavian Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unpleasant to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi came with the opinions in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think that if a woman had been acting like this, she would be called hysteric," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's vocabulary before the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotionally in his opening statement, sometimes he almost cried and was crying when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemnant to the Democrats of the Committee and called the claims against him a ‘great and coordinated character trap’ organized by liberals who were mad that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's evidence shows that he can't sit in the highest court because it shows that he's predicted against democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such opinions and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hurried when she was asked if she wanted to try to put Kavanaugh for the law of law if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority of the representatives' houses.
"I want to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress and the FBI, he's not just inclined to sit in the highest law, but also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the question Kavanaugh excluded questions whether he would review certain decisions of the highest law.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
There's a fair anger, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's so strange, do you?'
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my chief somewhere, who said she also crying when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began crying, she said to the person she talked to "you think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was fantastic."
Tears are allowed as an outbreak of harm partly because they are fundamentally misunderstanding.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs, was in a man-dominated office. I began to cry with unexplained rage and was grabbed in the neck force of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid – that brought me to a stairway room.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
'They don't know you're raging.
They will think you're sorry and be happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congress woman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he set as a presidency candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was detected to be intruded to the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and pulled away from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of as a president's candidate itself.
“It was not a transparent decision”, she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it "Snow White and the seven dwarves".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and sweared that she wouldn't still if she didn't get 2 million dollars.
There was a lost match.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $50.
"Do they think I get a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she kept the speech to announce that she didn't want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – thankfulness to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism -- that she fell together in crying.
"You would think I had a nervous crash," remembers Schroeder how the press mentioned her.
"You should think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking maybe what they would write on my grave support?
'She cried?'
How the United States-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
Opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were ear-døving, and even though the fight is far from over, a ripple between countries may be favourable for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by adding customs duties on important Chinese export products, including solar cell panels, steel and aluminium.
The main eskalation occurred this week with new customs rates on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which means duty of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, recovered every time, now at the latest with an estimate of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the United States attacks, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
It's too humiliating to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its shortly correctly, pressing around the trade war with the United States can give a long-term positive statement for China by reducing the mutual dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is much more dangerous than the viewers have seen before," said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, a thoughtsmia.
Syria ‘clear’ for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to return the country, which is angry after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are in improvement.
‘Today the ground situation is more stable and safe thanks to the progress towards combating terrorism’, he says.
The State continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country, who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted contingent assistance or help from countries that supported the rebellion.
