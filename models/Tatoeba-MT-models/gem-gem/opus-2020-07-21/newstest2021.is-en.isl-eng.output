Crying on the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well, and crying and crying out in nature has begun to draw people wide and wide around the world.
“You own the collapse, I need Iceland, ” says a woman out in the large world in comments on a post from the market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube material team.
Another audience will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman claims that it must come to Iceland as soon as she is the one who lives there.
However, unfortunately, it is in the United States and therefore expects to wait for a few months.
Another viewer asks if the route to Iceland is able, for no one is the planes.
Do not follow the story if it comes from another time zone.
Eglin Tordoson at the Peel Advertisement Agency, who made the advertisements together with the M&C Saatchi International Advertisement Agency, says that receptions have been hoped again.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland-trips that have gone very well, but this new trip is already going to be met.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, that's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's been incredibly good.
In a relatively short time, we have been discussed in some seven hundred media worldwide, totally reaching more than two billion people.
The value of this review is valued at $1.8 billion.
It's not funny."
The main market is the same as the United States, and the campaign has been very well there, although the United States is not on the way to the country in an emergency.
According to Egil, a known market area, such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany, has also welcomed itself, one Russian, who is comfortable.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically included.
“ These advertisements have traveled widely than we expected, ” says Egill, but more than four million people may have watched YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wanted after a better start.”
The pictures on the opening took Angel Süberg, the photographer of the morning magazine, on advertising the title “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs went wide and wide, such as at the School Guard Station in Reykjavík, in Reynis ferry, at Scogarphoss, on the Sundhemiak, and in the cave of the heads of the Heart.
The directors were Samuel Bjark Peter’s son, and Gunnar Paul Olafsson, at the Shoot of Production, and the recorder of the Son of God, Ottar.
In the palaces, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungarian.
Twenty islands came to the advertisements, but at the same time as the recording in Southern was another group in the western and western Fjords.
According to Egil, “Let It Out” is only the first member of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is designed for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first stage of this work for the Icelandic Hall, ” says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been very good.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign collaborators with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosion: Discussion of the labour market, lifestyle and many more
Onear Dadason's social and childcare minister, meets in the Sprengisand, which begins at ten o'clock today.
He is also a Labour Market Minister and addresses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair matter and more issues.
He also deals with rural matters and transportation to a country that has gone badly and has been divided in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Torr Ingolfsson, President VR, also meets the factor, but he will discuss his criticism of investments in biotypes and proposes ideas that labour movements and professionals will withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of interest excerpts.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar the son of Ingimar, the traveler in Austria, and Anrnheid John's daughter, the Chairman of the North Market Office, on the position of the travel service in the country.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading ban on what to come.
You can listen to the factor below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's how she looks today 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan’s wife had a successful course of youth in all kinds.
However, she was world - devoted for her game as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in the factors of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch and Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
A little has taken her in the past, but she has been able to look over a way and speak about Clueless in the lovely TV in the day.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died surprised in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I built the most of my personality on girls I met at school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Don't want to leave the police station after night.
Approximately fifty cases came on board the police in the capital area today, saying in the police’s agenda that the matter has been different.
The day of the police station at the Intergovernmental Gate began by the need for a lawyer to interrupt a person who had recently been released from a prison cell after having stayed on the grounds of a rape.
If the man did not want to go away after he was released, he did not obey the commanded police who told him to leave.
Due to the progress of the police, the man won a permanent stay at the police station.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year of suspicion of invasion in a company in Copavog.
Police also had to interrupt two people in Brethholte because of announcement of body attack.
Then, too, a woman who was sitting at a merchant at the shopping center of the Copawog could not pay for the account at the end of the meal and was therefore called for a police officer.
In the middle of the prayer this morning, there was also announced a stealing of the car.
The driver of the white Renault ambassador looked out of her for a while and was then taken a free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Blood of the Good Force - The Frightful Destiny of the Glass Hearts
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet for a curse over the ranking of the Gentleman, while Naya Rivera’s actress drowned in Californien in the day, and thereby became the third major factors to survive a long time ago.
The terms of the joy team (e. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
The ideas focused on the so - called joy team of youths at school, their love, and their destiny.
Being in the joy team was not always taken out, but through singing and dancing, the individuals of the elements seemed to overcome any situation that occurred in their lives.
But outside the recording sites, great disasters have run over the players and employees of the factors, so that the teachings have wake up that the curses are on the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera had the role of Santon Lopez in the factors, a klapper who didn’t call all his grandmothers.
After the ranking was running, Rivera went to possess Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for home violence against his husband and was divorced afterward.
However, Dorsey refused to submit a dear one, and the home victims were dropped.
On July 8, last, Rivera was reported to be missed after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat on the Lake Pira, California.
The boy felt sleeping in a life-saving west on the boat and could tell the police authorities that he and his mother had sworn, and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned there.
It was a great search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we had been looking for after Rivera had been drunk.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially dead.
It is estimated that she was in a heavy stream in the water, and she was new to her last demand to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the elements, the American footballman with the angel voice that played a key role in bringing the Gentleman to praise and respect.
Without the factors, though, Moneith had a personal devil.
Since the age of 13, he had suffered drug addiction and proved difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his collaborators found enough in the elements, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look better.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith felt dead in a hotel room after having gone out to entertain with friends.
Banamein was a fatal mixture of vitamins and alcohol.
It was not considered that willingness was being done.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance had reduced so much that the dose he had previously endured was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his coworkers, but on the basis of his contradictory wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the elements and dedicated them to the memorial of Moneith and his personality of Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the factors, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his meetings in the Gentleman, or until he gained the courage to acknowledge that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles for the protection of child porn.
At his home, we found a huge amount of child servants, and soon the matter was publicly asked.
It was evident that Salling had been.
He was accused and accused of his crime.
He had a head of four to seven years of prison, in addition to what he came to do in order to register sexual offences and seek treatment for childbearing.
Before the judge had decided the penalty, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
There were not just players of the elements that fell from far ahead of age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant team manager.
He became prompt to sleep in 2013, only 41 years of age.
At the factors, a woman named Nancy Motes also won.
She was the younger sister of Julia Robert’s grand star, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great government and disrespectfulness.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she suffered serious depression.
She left a letter to her father, in which she told her mother and sisters, among other things, have responsibility for her experience.
“ My mother and my so-called sisters have nothing left me except the reminder that they were the ones who caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the factors.
She has recently been accused of using her participants single and transgression at the recording site and having an overwhelming star steel.
Jesse Luken took part in the factors in 2012.
He was arrested and charged for an expedition in 2019, which felt a great shame.
The player Heather Morris played a major role in the factors.
In 2010, she caused unpowered computers to get into nectar pictures of it and to be viewed on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the elements and in love outside the factors.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had violence in her relationship.
Blooms can be placed on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and to watch them grow and grow.
It is also possible to do with flowers indefinitely as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel pointed out.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the odour, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth grade
“ I don’t think we are a lot of seafarers who are working in the country’s play schools, ” says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, who is hunting the beach in the summer, but studying psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter. ”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If the fisheries are well, you can have a good income, and I find it great to get rid of a study loan.
The pickups also do me well in the winter," says Axel Örn Godmundson, a 25 - year - old psychologist, who is hunting the beach in summer like the past summer.
Axel was the newest man who broke the Talkfire when a journalist gathered his speech late to the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The one I was in the tenth grade, I took a ship - governance right for a boat under 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I completed the basic school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my familiar, the son of John, Heartman; and I gave the boat his name.
He was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being a sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
He died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I agreed with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of summer when I had been hunting.
So I had the boat innocent at the end of my first summer on him.
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out to a boat when he had recently completed a basic school?
“ I had been putting forth and collecting money, I had worked with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all the summer hunting with him and got my share.
I also put my fermentation money into my boat treasure."
Axel is born in the feather of Isaford, wherefore all his mothers are; but he has lived in Copawog since he was a kid.
“ I can hunt here in the western area because I have a lawyer in my grandmother at the Isafire.
I learned in this area here west of the roots with my dad.
I'll move between the distances according to how I feel, because this hunting area reaches all over the western feather.
Even though I feel best to be in the west, I have also provided around the snowstone and elsewhere.
I have also given to the south, but then I prefer a grey drop," says Axel, who always runs one fire in the morning, saying sometimes speaking to the monsaws and singing before the sky, in the lonely hours in the ballish sea.
“ The outdoor network is good, so I can call, listen to radio factors and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on the boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in a rush, but surely, sometimes something has been weathering, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sea sick.
He says that the duration of the day of work will take care of how the hunting goes every time.
“ On the coastal road, I have never been more than 14 hours hunting at once, but I have also been hunting in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but I have been united for one and a half days in the fishing out of the sea. ”
The arrangement in the coastal fisheries says he is so that he can hunt 770 pounds a day, which he feels hamland.
“ Other restrictions are that I must not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only hunt 12 days a month, these four months of fishing on the beach, in May, June, July, and August.
I think seafarers should choose their hunting days after weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to be calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their head.
Thus, the area exchange can also go for me, and the sea space that is well located at the fishing room should be enjoyed," says Axel, who takes the largest torque from salt seas on its coastal hunts, but also only ulcers and individuals of other species are flying.
Axel is working in the winter with the college at Nupi School in Copavogi.
“ I don’t think we are a lot of seafarers who are working in the country’s schools, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only intended to work temporaryly at the school.
“ I got there because I feel this wonderful job.
I hope that the psychology study will benefit me from the school in the future," says Axel, who is also a long business study.
An error occurred when enrolled
An error in a recording magazine that people fill in when it arrived in the country resulted in a person living here in the country, not being called back in show.
It is not necessary to record a number of IDs if it fills out the magazine in English, as it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined during the week, ” says a physician expert in the field of the pharmacist.
Three national meals were identified in the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on the so - called homemeal took effect.
The people who lived in Iceland are then discouraged at the arrival of the country and are again preached in show four to five days later.
However, in the lunch news of the RUV, it appeared that the subject would have pursued the old system.
The border show was negative, and he was not called back in a ski for the virus.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus daughter, a pharmaceutical expert, says in a conversation with a news room that this may be a mistake in the electronic recording magazine.
If people are filled out in English, they are not required to insert a number of IDs, as is in the Italian version.
Even so, it was primarily thought for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the individual has not received an automatic invitation to show.
However, Kamilla says that many have followed rules on the return port, although they have filled the form of registration in English, and in some cases, employers have also been alert to return to showing people after they arrived in the country.
“This will be examined during the week how to facilitate access to this to raise its attention to the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been put into a petition.
All of them are showing, but two were starting to show symptoms.
Smitting is now undergoing the three infections that were reported yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there is a variation of the crown virus that has not been found in the past.
In the second case, Israel’s bonds have been directed, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus would come.
Overall, 15 are now in isolation according to the tissue COVID.
135 are in suspicion.
Four of five infections disconnected
In the past few days, five national meats have been identified in the country.
Of these, four alphas are disconnected, and they do not find the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports assembly yesterday.
Smithing is still ongoing.
Originally, on the third decade, they were sent to a suspicion, decreasing to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are infected due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
Secondly, this is in a short time that has been diagnosed by sports events and has raised questions about whether such events should be maintained.
John K. Johannsson, Head of Communication at the General Warnings Officer, says that as long as people follow the rules and rules.
“ We are constantly obliged to all those who live here to keep individual antiretrovirals.
We also need to deepen people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
Then it is possible to keep events, says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping on the air of individual contraceptives.
In addition, rules and indicators are constantly reviewed.
“ What needs to be done, and what the public warranty and the pharmaceutical agency are constantly inclined for people, these individuals are aware of.
Both homes and the same in service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on," says John.
“ We must urge people to continue on the good way we were on, in order to maintain the success we have made here to be kind. ”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard in the phone how hard her father had to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was fought to sudden respiratory difficulties due to crown virus infections.
Diabetes were reported on the death certificate as an underlying problem and Brumfield, also with diabetes, is deadly scared that the same will happen.
The Reuters news team does not say the fear of Brumfield without reason.
Counts of new studies made by the US authorities show that only 40% of those who have been killed with diabetes 2 were underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the proportion increases to half.
In 15 countries, over 10,000 people died from the crown virus during the period from February to May, the investigation of the US CAP (CDC).
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in CDC’s disease, says that the results are striking, not least for those who have diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
It was hidden in the slow growth of Reuters to explore and point out the answers from the 12 countries that answered to similar proportions.
10 countries, including Kalifornien, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet started to identify the underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes were already in a slow growth.
Now, COVID-19 has been breaking through as a powerful age," Reuters said by Elbert Huang, Chairman Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes are more common among blacks and people of south-American origins, which have also worsened from the crown virus.
The best protection for those with diabetes 2 is to maintain the disease with physically cultivated, holy diet and helping healthcare professionals.
However, in many weeks, the coronary virus age has made it difficult for many to keep a bus.
In that case, high levels of insulin have used some to continue working and thereby stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the US authorities may have been aware of the dangers of diabetes 2 could result from the virus.
When the SARS crown virus passed in 2003, there were over 20% of them with the disease, and in 2009, this group was at three times more likely to have a hospital.
When MERS did so, in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were transmitted to diabetes had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale university says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could have been longer, the phenomenon would have slightly hidden the number of previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that when this is done, we will see a flood wave of problems, ” says President Bolton of the International Association of Diabetes.
The physicians have warned that the crown virus age could in an indirect way lead to an increase in complications of diabetes, including kidney diseases and renal diagnosis.
Similarly, new studies will lead to the increase in diabetes infection.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already ill in many patients with diabetes.
In that case, a high proportion of glucose and lipid in diabetes can be produced as a true “cellular storm ” as it is called when the immune system responds too hard to and attacks the body.
Injured inhalation cells may also lead to an inflammation that can cause fatal blood clots again.
“ This is all one big pussy game, ” says Dela Cruz.
“It's all involved.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited champagne, and they left the room.”
The wife of Ásrún Magnus daughter and Atli Bollason became the unusual command from the artist Ragnari Kjartans son to engage in sex in front of a camera for works made by the artist in Paris.
“ We loved each other so this was not complicated. ”
Thus, Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Azrona Magnus’ daughter.
“ I was very happy with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so it also felt quite insanely sweet.
And still, he says.
Axrun also recalls the end of his husband’s first meeting regularly.
“ I'm always hearing this story.
Last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at the first occasion.
“ I felt and felt so much anxiety around the Atala, which I am elephant.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen, and I've been filled with it."
Atli says that the couple have stressed their own ways.
“ We do not bind our bags to the same nodes as the traffickers.
We're avoiding buses that we're dealing with around us."
There is a possible reason why they took the idea of the Ragnari Kjartan son of a filmist just rejoicing, although it would be most unusual.
“ Christ Anna, our common friend, contacts us and asks us whether we can get to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ingib - rescue wife of Ragnar, on Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, hit the three snaps, and they received desert wine, and each of them.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans on an image show that he thought he would set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the autumn.
“ He had a multitude of know -how work called Scenes from the western culture.
He declared it in a simple way."
Atsron says that he described the work as fatal and decades of the Western people’s everyday life.
“ He had a shot of all the teeth he was planning to shoot, and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part. ”
Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in should show young interstitutes to love in a minimal room.
“ These are interactions with the beginning and end, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much, even though they knew of him, and he of them “but they knew us and felt that we were fit for this.
They had words that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual prosperity from performing for others."
They crushed Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it took not long.
“ When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this? ’
It was just that way.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Ásron, and Atli.
“This is about love and neighbor”
Senan was taken into a fine apartment on the Moor Street.
There was a very small film team; a recorder, Ragnar, and a musician, and the pair.
After the recording was turned on, all the room left to wait out in a car except for Atli and Ásron.
“ We hadn’t decided anything about how we should be.
We received some instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and for each one.
It wasn't the game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásron.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, this was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Asron agree.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being a vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“ When a Tommi recorder looked at this, he cried, it felt so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ This is as much about love as the neighbor as his own consensus, ” says Ásron.
Parent’s parents have seen the work, saying that his mother heard the voice of the son of the Reykjavik Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to pitch in this, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "Good to attack the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Assron recalls.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relations of the Azerbaijanians and the Atala?
“ We are still together, so this may have deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the related family," says Ásron and laughs.
Asron himself saw the work in the Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I felt a little hard not to be with you but someone else, ” she says and turns to the husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because this is just one second in a much bigger work, and when you saw it with the other works, this is very great.
I could a little cut off this, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bone in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the senan was taken up.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to the Asrona and Atla in the Stories of the Arts of Russia.

Lawyers for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Messenger in Iceland, is in the castle of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed life guard where he feared his life.
However, it has not been for the President of the United States to be appointed as an ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Vorst left the office of the United States embassy in April 2009, all of them have been out of the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Fürst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastlys reported that she should have received the Falkwords in 2009.
On the occasion of a greeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she left Iceland, she taught international communication with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Vorst’s successor came to work, in September 2010.
To some extent, Robert S. Connan could have been appointed as a messenger, but then stopped.
At the work, Loius Ariega finally had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He then abandoned heritage 2013 and received the office of a missionary officer in Guatemala.
Then, another unleading - army period took place.
Robert Barber received the adoption of the United States Assembly in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but then there had been no messenger at the site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomate, but he had served as a lawyer and a short electoral unit, Baracks Obama.
He left his jobs as soon as Donald Trump received the presidential office, January 20, 2017, as the custom of politically appointed messengers.
Trump’s government was unusual to designate both missionarys and high officials in Washington’s control system.
Thus, two years passed until the United States assembly preached Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him about the challenges and confirm at the end as an embassy in Iceland.
In his witness at the plenary, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been broken from the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a skin doctor in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish organizations of the Republika class, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The playback owner Sheldon Adelson established them as a organization, but Adelson is a prominent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but then there had been no missionary in the country from the early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the largest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to designate people in a key office, and that the United States Assembly has worked in recent years very long, including confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been a total of five years in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented the execution of the missionary council, which opened a recent headquarters at Engetéig.
The performance is estimated to have costed about 6.5 billion, but nozzles of safety walls are converted to the building and glass is in all windows.
It seems, however, not enough to fill the current missionary’s security feelings, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has desired to receive a armed life guard.
The former IBV player had a racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims that he had become racism when he was in Iceland and that he would take care of coming to the country.
This is shown in a interview with Tonny, which appears in the Yugansk Mediterranean Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team in the top section of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including time in the country, playing with IBV, Val and Iceland.
“ When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but in addition, he was also with the tray number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side at the playtime with IBV.
One of the things Tonny speaks is racism that he had in Iceland.
He says that this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“ This happened once to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me that my opposer had made a racial reputation of me after I had taken him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes that he sees most remaining.
Tonny had not been able to come to the first team of Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the countryside.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and then he went to the lead at Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably be further.
He wants to mention that the loan to Iceland made out of his dreams of getting into Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 sm long black worm in a necklace woman looking there.
The physician was able to pull the worm out with a tunnel.
Study revealed that the snake animals were involved.
CNN explains this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which are your meat seeds.
Soon after the worm was removed, the woman improved, but snail animals such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi has been rubbing to the western countries, cases where snake animals have been burst into people have grown.
Fear that another wave begins in Europe
Spain is now in the light of concerns about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to resume the spread of the crown virus age.
In Catalonia, all entertainment life has been placed on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also undertaken action for the growth of infections in Spain, but in Britain, all of them have to be inadequate with the return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned from travel to Spain.
In France and Germany, smits are also increasing, where governments are trying to find the balance of the spread of viruses and bring back economic life.
However, the situation in Europe is good in relation to elsewhere in the world, but the global incidence of infection is nearly 300 000 per day, where it is considered the most infected in America and South Asia.
According to Johns Hopkins University, confirmed infections have become 16 million globally and are deaths confirmed in relation to the virus being 644 thousand.
Mosaic Acts Definitely Enjoying To Perfect
In front of the Tollhouse of Reykjavik, a large and deep hole is a place.
There are men with orange helmets.
There's also a big grave.
And more smaller working machines.
The gate is closed by the door.
Yet, the championship is capable, and there many are now stalking and respecting artworks from millions of mosaic flakes — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it is not worth it.
The job has been somewhat hidden, just before it was a car place that was always overset.
People put there, locked the car in a scratch, and then jumped to take care of their objects in the central city.
The ‘live and diversity of public spaces’ and the ‘advanced urban breakthroughs’ are a guide to the reconversion of the current safety gate.
The goal is to facilitate the area and allow mosaic activity to make a sacred daughter in the Tollhouse to enjoy a more vision.
Besides the work, the area is well held by the sun, it is considered suitable as a dwelling area for the travellers.
The artwork will be declared, and now the material tree will enjoy better than before on this 142 square meters surface.
In the area, small “dockers ” will also be made, some kind of water culptures that offer to play and give the area certain secretion.
In this way, the refinements are described by Reykjavik City, which is being carried out together with Veitum.
It will be renewed.
Many of them have arrived in their years, but the schools and the cold waterlags have been since 1925 and have served inhabitants and businesses in the middle of a few centuries.
When the gate is reopened at the end, cars can drive it again.
However, it will become a single policy gate, and as soon as possible, it will create more calm and more accessible space for walkers.
In a routine about the Tollhouse on the customs manager’s web, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Gisli Halldórson.
Because of the trailing damage through the house, there were 250 square meters of windowless walls formed to the street.
The Building Committee and the Architecture agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall portfolio, if no special arrangements were taken to practise the view of the house.
Thus, people agreed to calculate by putting up a permanent artwork there.
At that time a great deal of words came from the summary of Ancient Holy Daughter, an artist.
Had she worked much for mosaic artworks in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether the work would be competed.
It was often discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the port, for the port had been a lipose of Reykjavik since it was made.
When she was discussed with the artist’s wife, she had to tract out of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she returned from the country, where she would work on the suggestions from abroad.
She had the time she had to decide for herself, and when she returned home, she presented a few suggestions.
Soon it was agreed to ask her to do the job.
In addition, it was desired to make an overall agreement with it and the famous artistic company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them to establish famous artworks across Europe.
The contracts were made and the Artwork worked under the construction of the workplace of the brothers, which then saw the layout of the Told House.
In the summary, all the work was very well resolved, both from the half of the Daughter of the Holy One and from the Oidtmann brothers.
Since then, it has stood unbloomed Icelandic bets.
It took Gered about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Told Housework was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepare for transportation of more sites to land
The differences of Onear Dadason Social Minister proclaim that more public organizations will be transferred to the next country.
This was said by a minister in the Impregnant’s section on the Wave at lunch.
Recently, it was reported that the House’s and Human Resources Agency’s burning area will be transferred to the north of the Sea’s Arctic in autumn.
Six researchers in the field of burning work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the North Institute and have the National Relationship of Traffic Travelers to criticize the farming transport.
“ I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport," said Ásmundur.
He is convinced that the large majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it would be necessary to take further political decisions on the transport of public services to the country, as I was doing with the House and Human Resources Agency,” said Ásmund, but he also took examples of other bodies that have been transferred to the country and made a great deal of interest for communities outside the country, such as transporting food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland's Landmarks to Akraness and jobless security to the Skagastranden.
All the most important from the second day of the Master’s Interest
94. Iceland’s Master Meeting in Voluntary Sports ended in Akureyri, Germany, today.

Vigdis threw the most today, or 60,08 feet [60,08 m] in her last attempt, and then sat at the same time.

In a male class, the FH King Hilmar Örn Johansson, Icelandic meteorian, won a safe victory, a 73,84 feet [73,84 m] in his next last battle, and set an assembly.
His Icelandic measurement in the article is 75,26 feet [75,26 m].
Godni Valent Godnason, Olympia, and Icelandic meteorologists in circular castle, played a race in a bulb in the Torsfield yesterday, but today he struggled in a circular castle, which is his main section.
Icelandic God Vals is 65,53 feet [65,53 m] more than he threw 59,13 feet [59,13 m] today and guaranteed the victory.
Valdimar, the son of Erlend, was thrown for the next time today, but he had one valid casting in the second seat, 49,43 feet [49,43 m].
Havdish Victory daughter, Icelandic meteoric in a long - dark, worked the long-dickship with superior, but Hafdi’s jumping at a maximum of 6,25 feet today, which is just 40 cm from her Icelandic meteor.
In the 200 - metres race of women, the IR was the God - salvation of Jonah Bjarna’s daughter, who was thoroughly heard in 24,04 seconds, but her Icelandic meter in the article is 23,45 seconds.
The God - salvation of Jonah was happy at Akureyri, who earned two golden wages yesterday, 100 feet [100 m] walks and 4 x 100 feet [4 x 400 m] messengers today.
In a male class, Kolben Höden Gunnarsson from the FH was the first in the 200 meters race in 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Mána Samuel’s son from Anrman.
Like God - rescue Jonah, Colbean Capits won gold in the 100 metres yesterday, as well as 400 feet [400 m] of the race.
Doesn't be incurred for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Supervisory Committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who claimed to be guilty of a person in order to overcome their financial powers for the sale of the Bitcoin electrical coin.
The name concludes that the tax investigation manager had not given a clear reason for the need to blame the man.
The Committee's decision shows that the tax investigation manager considered the man to have divorced materially incorrect tax statements for the 2016 and 2017 revenue years.
He would have mismatched his financial powers for sale of Bitcoin’s electrical coin up to 27 million, either willing, or for a marvelous unemployment.
The man will be guilty for his behavior.
So the man rejected in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to have sold a electricity coins for 27 million in 2016.
During 2009 and 2010, he would have been buried when such things were both easy and indoors with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, the taxation of such sales would have been significantly unpredictable and unpredictable.
Most of them could have been expected that public citizens recognize such tax measures.
He would not have meant to avoid paying taxes from the harvest, and he would have recognized his own possession as an incontinent of the cash account.
He would have asked both experts and government tax managers about how this was done but without success.
Then he thought he had to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig after Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to study complicated rules on which tax authorities would not have made themselves clear.
The man thought that his taxes for these two years would be reassessed and pressured, but otherwise not punishment.
Then he repeated that he was working in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country from 2012.
He would never have meant to escape his duties in disobedient ways.
The demand for guilt would be entirely obscured and would put him in debt.
The breastmilk recalls: “This man understands what football is. ”
Andersen Willumsson has been considerable between the teeth on people, but has also been impressed because of its progress, what is done with a Breakfast in the Pepsi Max department.
Tonight, when they arrive at IA at a direct post at Station 2 Sports, they will be in the fireline.
Weddings take out a ban because of four reminders in the playtime, so they do not come to play with new cutting, as in summer’s games.
He had been writing “bla, bla, blah” on his pocket for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was responding with the payment, but it was better to try in the game, talking about character.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmund Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max girl, when it was considered to be a breastbirth.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it is difficult to realize what it is in.
He looks out a little to the left when it comes to the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Harvar, the son of Harvar.
Torkell Moon Petersson says Brynjólf real entertainment and is glad to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one is concerned about the fact that this is a character.
This is a funny bitch, and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
It's amazingly a lot of people occupied by him, telling me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am an entertainment force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and have fun of it."
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
The player KR says he wants to leave the company, "I've been in touch with some teams in the B department."
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in the Pepsi Max department, seems to be on a move from the team.
According to the Danish Mediterranean Bold, Tobias is ready to go home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in the homeland, but for that, he must first cancel his contract at KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic chance.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some teams in the B department and I will probably change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay my contract at KR."
Then he says that he probably needs to accept a salary reduction in Denmark.
“Councils in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar’s Wheel Wheel Wheel has recovered for millions - Now Answers After Discussion DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests in contrast to most others.
He thops up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes, and rollers.
Has Bjartmar gained the name “the wheelchair ” for this purpose.
Yesterday, when a person published a record of his relationship with the Bjartmar, there was so much a feather.
The DV then pointed out in discussions on the Facebook group of Western towns, where Bjartmar found that the man was speaking in the Eastern Territorium and said that the web might be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electrical scooter, but that Bjartmar had taught him.
The texts have now been changed on Facebook and the original news DV edited accordingly.
Clearly, the original news of the matter does not explain what really happened yesterday in the Eastern Corner.
Brightness said to have received information from the victim’s electrical listeners that these were truly their electrical trailers.
The information was received by another owner, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I looked at the guy, and I learned at the fireplace, with information that there was a electrical system that had been missed very long and sought.
Surely, I'd be tricking first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on my cart, I decided to cook to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I'm going very good in such a matter, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electrical cable offered him to show him the quit before the wheel and called himself a policeman.
“ Yes, great, ” said Bjartmar, “Let's just get this clean. ”
Then, the owner of the electrical system proved the ownership of his electrical system and drove on.
Later, as reported in the previous news, the right owner of the electrical system told his story on Facebook.
In this sleeping year that Bjartmar has put on this practice, he says, he can count the time he came to the side of people on the fingers of another hand.
“ I have had a peaceful relationship with the hardest people of Rykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are mostly the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, nails, psychiatrists, and other people on the streets.
“ Such addiction is a hard master, and somehow it is necessary to finance the next dose, because, unfortunately, the thief is easy to achieve that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My communication with these people is really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people taking care of me and then looking for me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
Generally, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is in courtesy.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him bills, numbers of wheels, and so on.
Bicycle thief is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even started pointing people to talk to him from stolen bicycles.
Brightness is inconsistent with the previous news transportation of DV and claims not to be any independent police in personal search for justice.
Asking whether he is not now on the throat of ice with his attitude, and whether this is not the first role of the police, Bjartmar so surely is.
“ Of course, the cops should do this, but the fact is that the cop is simply not doing this.
I have to make a look up the police riding away from a large bunk of stolen wheels.
She's clearly said in these matters.
“When the cop is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this class, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He claims that he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that he sometimes struggles on his “wheelmates ” on the street that they just had the brighter wheels they had previously reached.
The times that Bjartmar has called for help from the police have caused her simply to not meet.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the wheels to blame, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s because the victims of the bike died need to feel for the empathy of the police in this class.
The results of Bjartmars are not divided.
Many stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmar because they have come back to their own resources.
Bjartmar himself says that it has long lost the number of bicycles that he has returned, but the amounts will certainly run in millions, if not millions.
Weaves there, electric motorcycles, and electrical rollers are heavy, but electric wheels can cost up to half a million.
Brightness is working on a school day, and every weekend he is working together.
Thus, his cycling search is an unpaid work that he is doing during his free time.
Life-eye treasures and Long Shadows
In 2019, the year of birthday was a great year in the history of a livelihood treasure in Iceland.
Obviously, the officials had received a reward from the king of Dana all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919, the creation of an official audience was established, which eventually resulted in the morbidity of all officials.
The foundation for the current public wage life earnings was then laid down in 1969 with the total core contracts on the labour market, where a job - related mortgage fund was charged with a duty and a full amount of treasury from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these contracts, and the life - ear system continued to eliminate.
The life - ear system of wages was not the only dramatic change that the 20th - century labor movement led through its core struggle.
Unemployment security had been achieved in a similar way in historical trials in 1955, and the organization gradually received its demands for sickness and health insurance, a real urgency, a shortcoming of working time, improvements in housing, and more as much as that.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle, but they were proved to be thought, much more and more prolonged core replacement than the increase in the wage crop, which disappeared as hard as the valuation of the period after war and up to 1990, as many remember.
In 1969, the contractor for the establishment of general morbidities was both long and complex.
Even though the fact that the funds were actually to be owned by a subsidiaries, the workforce moved to the fact that their governments were to be appointed representatives of professionals and cooperatives.
In the next few years after the institution of the funds, the need for the majority of workers in the government of the funds was often discussed in the organizations of payers, but it never happened, and so we still have an abnormal arrangement that representatives of funds are not in the majority of governments of the funds.
The 36th paragraph of Law No 129/1997 on the guarantee of biological rights and the functioning of the mortgage funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
The first figure says: “The interests of the nation’s councils must be led to the light. ”
In addition, the 5th figure says: “The treasure of life must set moral standards in investments. ”
In the policy of the Lifeyrisguard of traders, the following provisions are laid down, in addition to the preliminary provisions:
The Supply for Life is a member of the United Nations rules on responsible investment, together with many of the largest livelihood funds and professionally invested in the West Sea and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues, in addition to good governance, can contribute to achieving investment results in the collection of creditors.
Thus, the interests of investments and the goals of society are in a broader context.
LV considers important that companies, especially those registered in the stock market, set public policy on: maintaining the good governance of social responsibility and environmental matters.
The value of the world’s largest funds has set up a “policy for responsible investments ” and there are similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic, “shadow management. ”
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not hoped that it has been defined, but the following definition now appears to be “most taken: ” Shadow management is when a head of the board says in the media that he is going to send the company’s representatives to the management of a physician claim or instructions on how to take positions in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be disfellowshipped from the government with the first suitability.
However, if the leader does not take this into the media and is not talking about a statement, it is not “shadow management” because, of course, there is always a relationship between humans in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader consider the way he feels “saveer. ”
In the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020, there are two men who have tried to form this definition when it is written.
It's the Horde Eugisson newspaper newspaper, and Asgeer Johnsson's bank manager.
The suggestion of both came to pass after the book of Nils Bogason President Icelandair had told his intention to terminate the agreements of the company with airlines and flight servants (supply them), and Ragnar Tor Ingolfsson, President of the Trade Society of Reykjavik, sent them the recommendations to the representatives of the company in the governance of the Liífeyrissguard to not support the possible purchase of the fund on the shares of the company, or they might be deceived.
Later, Bog Nils resigned his decision, and afterwards Ragnar Tor went the same way with his recommendations that, of course, were addressed to the decision of Boga.
Yet, they saw a hearing and axe reason to multiply on this matter in the Friday magazine of the newspaper, with great words on shadowing, law breakdown, and the need for changes in law.
A small pigeon had to wonder about a heavy lake, even though the blessed due had been in connection and was soon wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I struck here before the facts in the laws of a life-eye treasure that are in line with this matter.
In these terms, governments should be guarded for the interests of nationals and have moral standards in investments, and these elements are detailed in agreements between Gildis and Lifeeyris, as I mentioned.
Yet, life - earning funds should not only look at short - term mortgage losses in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy, and it would not be necessary for a long time to judge such things in the past, where large bank loans and funds have run to immoral adventures and environmental seeds, with harmful consequences.
President Icelandair was evident on the throat of ice when he thought that he would wipe out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reduce the well-being that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weaken its position on investors.
Happyly, he saw him and pulled it back.
The time shows whether it is sufficient to allow the company’s investment of mortgage funds to be considered to be responsible for funding.
The author is an ex - professor in science and history.
One of the infected practices did not come home
One of the three of them that were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic kingdom of 15 July ago, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an islander who is not regularly inhabited here and is not given clear instructions to carry out so - called homemeat after the arrival of the country and to another show a few days after the arrival.
He got negatively out of the ski at the border.
“ But he is in the Icelandic community, and he is actually supposed to get into it, ” says Kamilla Joseps daughter, a physician in the field of antiretroviral disease, and a permanent physician during his summer vacation, in conjunction with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form, and there is no obligation to register the ID numbers, and if the ID is not recorded, you are not automatically proclaimed in the later vision.”
She says that the man could have used the English form of registration because he is actually resident in abroad, but because of his connection to the country as an islander, he would rather have used it in the Icelandic.
But he didn't realize this.
“ When the teacher is not recorded, you need to seek to come in the second show yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ Thus it is clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find a way to make an automatic preaching system, although the Icelandians do not record their teaching numbers.
Or to make it somehow clear who are participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Happyly, though, the person who arrived in the country would be consumed, even though he was defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a prominent islander.
Only six of them have been sent to a suspicion after he was discovered yesterday and were in contact with him.
They are going to show, but two of them have started to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man was negative from his show at the border of July 15th.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she was not yet able to detect in it when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude that the man has been infected here in Iceland, but is not carrying the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to say that this is certainly an infectious infection because it has been long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little war in connection with the sports conventions. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but notes that it cannot be excluded until the Icelandic genetic analysis has been arranged for the virus in the man.
“If we have a virus depth that has not been seen here before, it is almost safe that he has carried it to the land. ”
Piper sprays and bombs used against Protestants
A struggle came between police and Protestants in Seattle tonight.
Polices used the protestants of peppersprey and unforbidden handstones, but Protestants broke rods and crocheted in.
45 Protestants were arrested and 21 police servants hurt.
Police violence and racial prejudices were protested in many United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one contradictor was shot to death.
As shown in BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then ceased to the building area and broke a rod in the city courthouse.
Following this, the police said that the protests were unprecedented, and there were conflicts between groups of Protestants and police.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, mentioned by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one hurts.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of nationals gathered and demanded justice for Breonnu Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group had firearms and went in the neighborhood to the closed gate conventions where the police were in charge of the group of people who protested the protests and also had firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was murdered by a white cattleman in May.
Solar: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, director Manchester United, does not want to make too much out of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final circuit of the English electoral department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, the end of Solskær and his men in the 5th seat and thereby lose from the Master's District.
However, they should still hope to come to the Master's Department by working the European Department for the next month.
“ We are not at the end station.
If we get a step against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad period now," said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have much in the land by reaching the two lines above us, ” said Solskær.
It is evident that the nerves of human beings will become thundered at 15 a.m., but Solskjær tried to act like each other.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you must get used to be under pressure in the last game of the period.
It's nothing new, and it's based on it.
We have made a great opportunity to end the period well, and now it's our to use it," said Solskær.
“ This is not the most important game of the period, it is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The definition does not define our period, we've already had a lot of hours to define this period."
“ The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed much for us, and I think we are better and much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskær.

Fear of the Other Wave of the Pastor
The Spanish governments are now trying to retain the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID—19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports at one day from the beginning of May, and the newspapers at the same time as the Spanish begin to deplete one of the most stringent exit bans in Europe.
The relapse led to the obligation of British authorities to take passengers coming from Spain to take a suspicion at home.
A week earlier was Spain on the British list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have taken the broader limits to try to cope with growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, entertainment places will be closed the next two weeks, and older houses will be closed at midnight.
Now the exit is now in force for 200 thousand inhabitants of the Segria County in the western part of Catalonia.
It is considered that British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is very angry with the arrival of foreign tourists and is disturbed.
Tui, the largest travel office in Britain, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Worldwide governments are said to be prepared for the second wave of the phenomenon, but little interest seems to be to reappear a massive ban on exit, which has been ruined by the economy.
To form, Boris Johnson, president of the British, has taken such a very bad way, similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that “the nation would not be killed, economically or socially, ” if again the country’s ban would be taken.
If there is a number of employees who are hoping for the local destruction of the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or regions, will be able to retain the virus in the next round.
Five New Infects in Iceland - Three Inland
Yesterday, three domestic meals were discovered in addition to two additional borders.
Thus five people with positive Covid-19 infections were discovered yesterday in Iceland.
In the report of the generalists, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football assembly.
Has he been sent in isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a suspicion.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the Rykjavik sports community and is according to the notification, “only part of the sport” in an injury.
Others who were sent in suspicion are related to the man in another way.
The source of this infection is unfounded and the complete infection of the National Police Office.
ReyCUP’s counterparts have followed the instructions and rules of the physician and the generalists still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
On the other hand, pictures of the assembly were attentive, seeing in a very close convergence to rejoice on the field.
Just before 11:00 a.m., the contradictors published the following notification on their Facebook page.
“ ATH: Parents are pleased to respect the rules that competitors take their own business in school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for the showed understanding."
Another infection was reported yesterday but was associated with the infection reported last day.
The report states: “Icelandic genetic analysis has seen the infections and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”

A patriark celebrates the tabernacle booked on the sales hall - Directed Guests Other
The Territory of the Palestinian Federation is completed during the weekend, according to announcement of the western population.
Guests are advised to review other hostages.
The western-born Bildudal, Valley, Melanes on Redsand, Hotel Factoryund, and Hotel Bretavian as another option in the position.
There is enough to be at the patriarkfire of this weekend, for, like the previous year, a celebration of Icelandic films will be held in town.
It has been maintained since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
As a result of an effort in the tent area, this year can be expected to be a good meeting, if the weather does not account for a stroke, but DV said earlier today of a deliberate prophecy.
But may the worst weather be expected southward, and hope for the patriarchs.
The web page bb.is first reported, and said that all other guests in the city were already fully booked.
A whole village house crushed down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free of Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners are seeking a restructuring permit, their aspects have been successful in the system for three years.
In one of the oldest, grave, and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, there are a beautiful village house on three hills.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of stores.
The back of the house is the door of two walks, each of them stores four quite awesome apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, although most of them are more than 100.
The house has a considerable history to be stored.
It was built in 1959, and it has included a video camp, the Scoe, the milk store of the milk sale, the Joa armour, the sale of fish, and now the last high school printer.
The house has remembered his fifth more beautiful.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 hf.
The owners of D18 are according to a company program among other Magnus, the son of Magnus, and Godrun Holy daughters of Lárus.
Magnuel was the owner of the Payment Group, and he was a defendant of the Payment Holding Society.
A group of owners of the Payment Society is Stálskip ehf.
Ship, for example, is a investing company of the Godrow of the Holy daughter of Lárus and her children.
Godrun is also the owner of a third part of D18.
Godron and her husband, August, the Godmunter of the Victory Son, once destroyed Stalship.
The D18 e.g. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has little that has not been maintained since then.
The neighbors say that the situation of the house has worsened constantly since, though most in recent years.
On the Facebook site of the neighborhood, one inhabitant says that the house “wasn’t particularly vivid for the past years. ”
There may be an indication that the owners have been seeking to change the house and trap for a few years.
Other neighbors say that the house has long not been okay.
“ It is long time to do something common with this spot and sadly that it has been so. ”
He also tells that he is filled out in the house’s owners because he has not been able to finish this, find a common surface with the neighbors of the house and stop this “legislative step. ”
“Do this only in consultation with the community so that it can be done and completed.”
The “technological step” that the resident refers to is the organisational process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga, 18 and 20, were sought to build a height above the current multiquarters house and behind the house, a new lift house, and an annexation at one height in addition to a cellar.
The Building Authorisation granted for that implementation was dedicated to the Environmental and Resource Surveillance Committee, and the Committee dismissed it, since the implementation was not supported by the Participation Organisation and the branch notification was not satisfactory.
So, then, the city of Smoke began with a divisional work and finished it with an advertisement in July last year.
That organization was also close and dismissed it from the Committee in March 2020.
Thus, at this point, nearly three years were passed from the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the beginning of the building.
The house had suffered considerably, and the neighbors were tired.
When DV asked neighbors of the house in the situation, the reactions of the neighbors were answered in various ways.
Some had a understanding of the purpose of the house’s ownership, others did not at all.
Others directed the anger to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing definitely out of anybody.
Others also said that the car parks had a controversy, but neighbors have new unused car parking Dunhaga 18 - 20 under their driving equipment.
One boyfriend in the matter said long - tired in the government:
“ Let us go through the trigonometric process is quite unbelievable.
It's like the city of Reykjavik couldn't read."
Today the house stands empty, leaves, and is neglected.
A memorial of the city’s governance and the magnificent intents of owners and many years of work of those who are now in the first place.
When a journalist had a garden on Dunhaga 18, his doors and scraps flouted.
Playstation computers and recent televisions were within another waste on earth — the victims of an island summer.
It was open to the old university’s office and there was much of the cats of the bulb to judge.
It is clear that someone has been in one corner, but no one can be seen.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a number of sheets of geographic paper pages, which would undoubtedly have to be a book, were blurred.
The house’s stairways were also open and lived in both.
A journalist was so lucky to attack the inhabitants of one of them.
There were the Romanians to offer a potato right at dinner and invited a magazineman.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce employees.
They've been there for some time and certify DV that the company has paid nothing for the house but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not worthwhile to inquire a rental.
As a result of the post in the house’s breathing door, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers in the last losses.
The workforce has not been guarded of the Covid-19 situation, but the convergence in tourism has led to a convergence in the building industry, and these two industries have been the most vigorous use of employees' services.
Yet, after a long day of rain, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung up the labour valleys and exchanges in the share to thirsty.
It should be noted that despite the bad condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be a good maintenance.
When a journalist spoke to the boys in bed, he suddenly became the calm height clear: The best place in Reykjavik is 1,500 square meters of property.
Owners want to change the house to improve and neighbors want to improve the situation but share the definition of “bates. ”
Between the city’s organizational area, the victims of endless prosecution, and love in the organisational process, and the flexibility of the excise committees on environmental and resource matters.
In the house there are so bedennic workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandians stop fighting.
The article is originally published in the DV 17 July.
In response to excessive weight following the crown virus age
President of Britain, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a battle against overweight, which will include a ban on sudden advertising, as a result of serious sickness, partly due to his weight.
On Monday, tomorrow, Monday, Johnson presents the battle that has been promised to be better health, but he will be encouraged by the physicians to prescribe bicycle rides for his drivers in excessive weight and will also be involved in increasing cycling.
Then, according to British media, advertisements on TV will be banned by 21:00 a.m.
“COVID—19 has awakened us against the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, active and eat healthy food”, held by the government's speaker.
Johnson himself has been involved in gravity problems, but he was put into care when he was infected by the crown virus in ours, and it is partly to his weight because he is considered to have been so seriously weak.
Women better disappearing the Changes
She said that the new governance program was the greatest step that the nation can take in the direction of more power, intermediateness, and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change a little now, and who is better in order to make such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
It's women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are familiar for their women’s convergence.
Standing together and keeping together in conducting changes.
So now we're just coming to lead these changes."
She said she was somewhat anxious about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both sex and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to examine what to do.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and examine what needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we come and know the story and listen.
Listen to voices of bordered groups.
We don't live on the same rules all of us here," said Helga.
She said that women are in many good matters in Iceland, but she added that, like somewhere else, the Icelandians would be very male.
She said that politics were turning to form their own interests, authority, and powers, which were the powers of misjustment in all communities.
“ Women have now set up this group and come together and have just become a little worse about the fact that the General Assembly is going to look beyond this 2012 national vote, ” she said.
“ It’s these female values we’re thinking about.
From human rights and natural protection, collaboration, and the fact that we are all really sitting at the same level," she said and added that the previous values were the basic values of the new government record.
“ We are a very rich country of natural depression, and it is ridiculous that there are people living with poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women are always less paid.
It is ridiculous that pilots and nurses need to stand in a core battle forever only to achieve human wages."

The next free night in the house is about the sales hall.

Tugends of injury and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with domestic crown viruses and most of the infected are unrelated.
Thousands have been infected because of this, and some of them have started to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Yesterday, three were diagnosed with the inland crown virus and two at border discs.
A specialist in the state physician’s office says that the growing number of domestic smits does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ It has been seriesed from the former domestic issue, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think it has been secretly in society for some time.
This is probably something recently arrived in the country, but of course, we need to be very careful now, ” said Kamilla Sigride Joseph’s daughter, a occupational expert in the field of occupational healthcare.
Most of them have been related to people who came from abroad.
Further demonstrations will take place in the next place, but some who were in conjunction with the infected people are beginning to show the symptoms of the crown virus.
“ Now there is no influencing, and there is no reason to remind us of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free by doing these tests to individuals who would have found a reason to do something else first during the time of influencing, ” said Kamilla.
It is not excluded that more people need to be infected.
Two of the infected were detected after attending sports events.
Has this raised questions about whether such events are defensible.
As long as people follow the rules and rules, the general government’s commander says that it is slowly.
Camilla is almost excluded from the fact that the infected were infected at the athletes.
“ If there is no further isolation from these individuals after they have been associated with them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our contradictions at the conventions have been active.
But it has not been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Department of Public Protectives is continuously reviewed.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems that it is possible, ” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, multidata limits will be adjusted to a thousand people.
These new situations may affect disturbances.

Elisha feels very nourishing to attend his daughter early at the school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to the second party’s exercise.
After training, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl's sleeping, we like to look at one thing to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting a final hand on the master’s work in nutrition and knowing what it is suitable for to have enough energy to carry out work, school, family, and exercises.
“ I can eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, hydrocarbons, and fat.
However, I feel the most important in healthy relations with food and do not classify food in bad or good, rather nutrient or nutrient.
It's all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.

Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared rebellious as a result of numerous protests in the central city.
Yesterday, the police took to blossoms and peppers to tempt to ruin a large area that Protestants subdued and stretched over many houselengths in the vicinity of the city’s county house.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that the investigation had been carried over to an injury that was done at the police station in the city last night, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Citizens and police authorities say that Protestants had crushed police with crushing, bottles, crushing bombs, and other unclean, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the meetings in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blow was for them to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, but there has repeatedly come to harsh conflicts between Protestants and depressed state police.
There, like in more cities of the United States, people gather under Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on May 25, recalls systematic racism in the United States and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after voting
Still, it is not possible whether the statements of the Icelandair airlines, which should take effect for the next month's convention, will be revoked.
Iceland Airlines' nuclear agreement for Iceland Airlines at Icelandair's Airlines ends on lunch tomorrow.
Godlaug Líney John’s daughter says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusion of the vote is available.
“ This is completely hanging together, ” says Godlaug Líney.
“ No statements have been revoked. This must be done so that the machines can be managed.
And then, of course, people are unhappy after knowing whether they will work after the monthly convention."
The appointment was signed a week ago, the 19th - July Passover.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025, based on an agreement that had previously been awarded by airlines.
On July 17, Iceland’s Freedom Society’s Government and Confidential Council agreed to pronounce an Icelandair General Work Station, and societies agreed to vote.
It never came to her, but this was determined after the decision of Icelandair to stop conversations with the Flying Friends Society, cancel all their flight friends and look for contracts with another party.
Then the company’s pilots had to take a temporary job on board safety teams.
Asking how she thinks that the vocabulary will go, Godlieg Lineey says hard to say about it.
“ People are in pain after this action, Icelandair, when all the airlines of the company were cancelled and announced that the agreement would be made with another community.
Now it turns out if it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots worked at Icelandair, and 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their declaration rates are disadvantaged, with those who have the highest working life when he ends three months and thus ends at the July August monthly conventions.
There are about 90% of Icelandair airlines.
What does the agreement not accept?
“ Then we wish for continued conversation with our consultants.
With this agreement we meet the requirements of Icelandair.
He is rejected, it is clear that the pilots have gone too far.
A vote on the core agreement will be closed and Icelandair will present a second quarter of the year tomorrow
A new core agreement ends at 12 a.m. on lunch tomorrow.
Icelandair's report for another quarter of years will also be published tomorrow, but the preliminary results suggest that the company's revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the past.
Iceland Airlines and Iceland Airlines’ Organisation’s Electronic voting agreement began on Wednesday, 22 July, and will finish tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at midday 12 a.m.
Those who can choose the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay social charges to the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new core agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday before, Icelandair had disrupted conversations with the company after the previous voting agreement at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and the airlines of the company on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new core agreement was signed.
According to a new core agreement, airlines need to fly more than five hours a month for the same basic wage.
The core agreement is valid until 2025, where pilots and airlines have been agreed for how long they can fly on one watch.
The agreement was presented to companions at a meeting at Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and declared a lot of airlines discussed by a newsstudio on the grounds of the contract.
However, most people seemed to agree that the agreement would be agreed to keep FFI alive.
Icelandair's report for another quarter of years will be presented tomorrow than the EBIT company, its financial and tax business income, is negative, according to the preliminary exclusion results, about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic dollars.
Icelandair sent the Copenhagen for the last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s revenue had studied about $60 million in the quarter or $8 billion.
During the end of the quarter, about $21 billion, a hand - hand money and its equivalent were about $154 million.
Icelandair also aims at offering the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is to complete agreements with 15 loans, governments, and Boeing the aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the partial invitation to tender.
New variation rather than new type of virus
“ New virus only means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been painting here in the country," says Már Kristjánsson, supervisor of the National Hospital’s Department of Infectious Disease, saying that “new type of virus” has been identified here in the country.
Three domestic meat was discovered yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed had participated in the social work of the sports community at the Rey Cup Cup, but the origin of the infection is unfounded and infectious.
Injury was also detected in individuals who arrived in the country on 15 July, two who were in association with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday’s infection related to infection reported last day and after the Icelandic genetic analysis, “new type of virus that has not been identified here. ”
Infection is finished in connection with this infection.
It may be noted that there is no new virus, but this is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new crounus virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variance of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asking what it means, and if it could tell something about the beginning of a other wave of phenomenon, Mr. Marr says that, as a matter of a single case, there may be no more out of it.
“ However, if there are cases in which a country is not connected from abroad and has the same genotype as this particular variation, then it would be possible to draw the conclusion [in the second wave], but it is untimely to support it,” explains Már.
Good luck in the hot pot
Is the secret of happiness hidden in the hot pots?
As a result of BBC’s recorders in a fun video that sheds light on the pool and hot pot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bathing population is a special worldwide, and it is claimed that no one in the world is as many places of prayer in every inhabitant.
The natural earthquake is the basis of it, but also the tradition of distortion that is here.
Children’s education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are still able to use hot water for health improvement.
Sundry is described as a fixed part of the country’s general welfare.
Everyone in the pot is equal, independently of standing.
With the phones, people talk about their homes and spaces or the use of the similar power of the water: meditate and load the electrical loads of the soul and body.
To pick up hundreds of days
There are hundreds of days until the Americans go to the elections and choose the president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a reselection, but he's got to pick up.
Joe Biden, the foreseeable prosecutor of the Democratic Group, has a lot of national presidency on Trump, taken into account by the researchers.
According to a new study by the AP, the number of Americans considers that the nation is incorrect.
Likewise, Trump’s response to the world’s new crown virus is very opposed to more Americans than before the President was disadvantaged in economic matters.
In particular, only two of the ten Americans say that the United States is in the right direction.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the phenomenon, and 48 percent say that he has been well in economic matters.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent in the country, with Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw his attention from his view of the patriarch of Biden, to promote so - called cultural disputes and to proclaim policy that should turn to law and rule.
However, Biden’s procurement is endeavoring to keep his attention to Trump and considers a great chance of victory if the choice is actually about how Trump has been working in the past four years.
Trump’s adversaries also seem to come down to the members of the republic group and fear Promotors that Democrats could even reach the majority of the United States Assembly’s Senior Department, which has been very slowly hitherto.
Politico told us in the day that following classes and prosecutors would be comparable, and that is now, the Rebellic Group would have the greatest disturbance for decades.
Environment has proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 sessions, and now it looks like that development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants to follow him, including by saying to be President Biden, if he will destroy the outside of the United States and undermine race disputes.
Among other things, Trump has declined regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the peripheral diversity.
He then urged “home mother ” to explore the United States to read a article of the former assistant director of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the United States and took Trump under it.
“ The prayer will ruin your neighborhood and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the president.
Inhabitants of the United States are a growing group of electorates.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reselected in 2004, the prosecutor who has received most votes in this group has become president.
Unless in 2012, when Mitt Romney received most votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
Studies have shown that, despite Trump’s guaranteed little majority in the environment in 2016, his follow-up has been significantly collapsed.
Although there is a difference between the tests, Biden has measured about 15 percent of the preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary preliminary action.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the walks?
After the final decision had been taken to suspend the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have been declined up to now, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the walks, ” where it expected to be in the world’s age of crown virus that the world - inhabited worldly is now undergoing.
There are years to prepare themselves, and Japan’s authorities have added costs for the delay.
However, everybody keeps a lot of heads in the field.
When announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives’ joy were true.
They grew and laughed for a lot, and to the end, Tokyo had visited to hold the games in 2016, but it was closed in a lower way for Río, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo’s city and Japan sat to the world’s attention.
The players were to go on July 24 to August 9, but have been suspended for years, and they will begin on July 23, 2021, ending on August 8, which will end.
If you cannot hold the games, if the crown virus becomes too dangerous, then the games will be stopped.
However, no one wants to think the thoughts to the end.
Olympics are not a usual sports race.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be wonderful and look at the top of the last game.
The elected city for Olympia is based on the assessment of the election committees on the presentations of the cities.
The magnificent of the presentation — the more likely to get the nose.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or over $20 billion.
Last time, when visited for the games in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to receive the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had then spent about $30 billion for the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea in view of how much it takes to build Olympic villages, scenes, and generally strengthening the country’s indoors to cope with such conventions, to prepare it, and to keep the games.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which were supposed to be ongoing in these days but have been suspended for a year due to the crown virus, would have costed $12,6 billion.
However, a report from the reconciliation report in Japan that came out last year showed that the cost was twice that number.
It is likely that the cost of breaking the games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it can cost two to six billion more than the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
It is so high that all taxpayers of the Icelandic State only serve about half the Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the size that they would like to become a reactor of economics who are trying to make figures and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
As far as it seems, many have come to the conclusion that the effects of Olympic Games are less positive for the economics of the cities that hold them.
Some people, for example, have a very large number of jobs for a short period of time, but for a long time, cities are frequently upside down with debts and threatening the cost of smallly used humans.
Río, Brazil, has been in great debt because of the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the big sports work built for the games.
After the plays in London in 2012, only 10 percent of those who received jobs in the city’s Olympic Games have been unemployed before.
This means that no new jobs were discussed except in a small way.
In general, cities have not come very well out of the financial affairs of keeping Olympia because of the lower cost of the human activity that is built for the games.
However, benefits are often included in an increased journey of travelers who want to visit the Olympic Citys following the games, which are very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether to accept all the number of audiences who usually visit the games.
The main matter is, however, the honor that the cities have to be elected, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
Despite a huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players are bringing is not the nature of the value that can be put on it.
Of course, although the show is likely magnificent and there is no saving, this is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in front.
For some realists, it is surprising only to be loving to break out the games.
For example, the Australian five - year - old woman and the Golden Award in its article on Olympia Games, Chloe Esposito, is a casino that had been far from good age for summers, but has the hope of being in competition for the 2021 games.
So it is among the sportsmen who are rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to stop after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some cases, the breakdown of the games means that they will stop the race before the games occur.
Just do not trust their body to go through years in addition to strangerful exercises.
Few sportsmen found themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the Olympia Games in Río 2016 and the Simone Biles fiction star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has recently met in a number of interviews in its homeland in the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's going to the 2021 games, but she's not absolutely sure that she'll still be at the top of the games next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a female female in the first row.
“This is a sensitive matter,” says Biles, but smiling in another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked if she was going to reach as long as the 2021 games she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know whether I’m still on the top after a year in addition to exercises, ” says Biles.
She has previously mentioned that her body has no longer tolerated the pressure that is a result of fierce training.
Yet, she is exercising for the Olympic Games in 2021.
Biles admits that it was uncomfortable to suddenly stop practicing when the world’s age was the highest and the foolish room was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympia gold couldn’t buy any access beyond the other; she had to find some ways of keeping in the form as others.
The basic form certainly is better than in most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start training once again after the foolish room opened.
We started slowly, but we're again in full steps, and I'll increase my exercises as far as the year goes.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we are still practicing in view of their being, can’t do anything else.
I've been trying too much to leave the sport right now," says Biles.
With her, like others, doubts or perhaps rather conscious that the situation can arise that the games will not be held at all 2021 either.
It is hopeless, though, to predict that.
No one can know how the situation of the world’s crown virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do, but prepare for the Olympic Games as they will be held for a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be light at the end of the Covid walks.
Delayed a wedding for a family
The modern family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to suspend her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette of Wells Adam’s rival in summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about accurate now, ” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We definitely want to marry sometime and have the dream breakfast and have all those who are in love with us.
However, we decided to put it on a delay and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of having masks and keeping at home.
I'm looking at world issues more than wedding issues today.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
