Food debt of European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, the cost was higher than expected in November, according to the 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Notenbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the leadership; according to their assessment, the reduction of interest would benefit from the rising raw material prices and the slight reduction in unemployment.
The ECB is endeavoring to keep inflation rates below two percent, or at least slightly at the two-percent mark.
According to analyzer, the ECB is located in the Zwickmill: "inflation must be "equipped" in order to exclude later action needs.
With 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate in November reached a 12-year record hook in Germany; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The rise in food and energy prices is responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soya beans also reached a record hook since 1973.
Also in food oil and milk products there was a considerable cost in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per phase of the black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase from 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is expected to decrease by 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analyzers go out of a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 3.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Placed Government Crisis
After long stamps, the number of Fidesz sympathisers has grown significantly until early December. The party has since 2002 had the largest base camp, while the agreement for socialists has reached a depth of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference is clearly seen in the participants, thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) represent a fifth (20 percent) consent to the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary inclusion: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party selectors has grown by a percentage in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic atmosphere has further worsened - never before, the proportion of those who judge the economic situation of the country as "extremely bad" was so high (41 percent), while still 46 percent think it is "smallly bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population will have a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is based on a improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the work of the Prime Minister as "more bad as right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have large confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the advocates for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% does not trust the Head of Government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the Fidesz Party Manager.
One of the indicators of political atmosphere is the number of those who believe that unpleasantness with the Prime Minister could be handled without government change.
If, after the disturbances in the past October, 35% were expressed for the remaining of the government and the Head of Government, this share is still only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees the solution in new elections.
As asked for their interest in the people's vote, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with security", and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
In comparison, if Parliament's elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would "with security" go to the urns, another 15% thinks their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be seen.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital day money.
Based on the group of participants in the "safety" public vote, the proportions of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs' trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases from over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
Since the prices in the food markets were "davongalopped" last December, the cost is not drastically depreciated compared to the yet high, previous output level.
However, it is decisive for consumers that the amount for which they had paid much less than 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10 000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magic 10 000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained nearly at previous years, while the prices for pudent breast filets, nuts and mouths have risen strongly.
Prices for meal and bread matched the data of Hungary's Central Statistical Office, but in Auchan there were 1kg breadweaks for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price disturbance in the product to below 200 forint.
Also surprisingly, here was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pfand bottle of under 200 Forint, thus the drink included Pfand only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" cart comparison alsoan cut the most expensive, and Cora the most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the Napi cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest cart of the last year and the cost of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noticeable at the last Christmas prices.
This process has made trade argue: Apparently, the houses of goods did not have the right to decide which price margins they should apply to each item, since the impact of price increases on consumer behaviour was indispensable.
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product poorly, it can fall to significant gains in the price margin which is directed by transport intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer conditioned the cost of the "Napi" cart in the last year so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price difference at the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost 1,630,00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophal price increase was shown, the price of the daily consumption products in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, again, does not necessarily confirm the data of Hungary's Central Statistical Office: In some basic nutrients, the Statistical Office established a more than 30% cost in the 12 months period.
So in some meal also in eggs.)
However, if you look at the "Napi" cart, this seems to be almost impossible in the last few, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year even in the worst case, has increased by little more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - they could devote the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the Golden Trade Triangle, the hypermarkets are not complained; good years are reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at the prices.
It is purchased from large quantities, durable foods go into pallets over the shop tables.
On Wednesday morning the morning there were endless serpents at the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower rate of customers is reported by the country, so that many multis complain about opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only in foods but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Polyrouteds are saved to disinfectants
Heaven has been recorded more than a thousand infections in hospitals resulting from an inaccurate dealing with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not just tolerant to the infects, so the executive doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many reds are also saved in the disinfectants.
A MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatic department of the Jáno hospital.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was transmitted to the hospital after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a few later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. A major operation has not been performed since the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, hospitals 1094 were reported to the National Nosocomalis Surveillance System by multiresistant agents, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium wears about a third of the people in their nose, without it would cause a disease.
SA-related infections (such as haelse inflammation, male inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the funds are excessively dosed or inappropriate, antibiotic resistance from the well-responsive bacteria resulting in rapid spread in hospitals under the corresponding conditions.
In particular, in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the Jáno Hospital, the MRSA infection is not special, such events belong to the hospital everyday.
If you do not have to interfere with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only not there where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the career carries rubber gloves and masks in supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
While the patients are studied at MRSA during their hospital administration, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of infections in hospitals caused by MRSA would be avoidable, but the current dominant conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to prevent the emergence or spread of the multiresistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly homes, the hospitals should examine the patients submitted and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, the microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from sides of the State Hospital.
The majority of cases would therefore only come to daylight if the patient has a remarkable MRSA infection, then the doctor’s leader of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union there are strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives for the treatment of certain infections and disease images in Hungary.
Antibiotics should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order not to be resistant to the drug, but these directives are not always complied with by hospitals.
In the case of ambulants, or in primary care patients, microbiological samples were even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are spared
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred by one patient to the other most frequently by the career.
This is why the washing of hands or the wearing of gloves and masks is important, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals.
MRSA is transferred by drip infection or contact, but it is not always possible to isolate the infected patients in the home hospitals.
The rooms are even frequently filled with beds hardly aligned with each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from epidemiological perspective.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, it is unfortunately in the less funded hospitals even that disinfectants are spared, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that are just favouring the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrated to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the agent can be stopped where these protective measures are respected, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections manage the health insurance cause huge costs, so they are fighting everywhere.
For example, in England, the prevention of MRSA, or their condemnation, was maintained in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declined.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant agents (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
Death-linker politicif was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the commander of the XXII district with a fatal exit, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday when a car accident was not alcoholized, nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest supreme lawyer on Friday after the official opinion was presented to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on tax.
The former police chief booked with his own truck in XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos street and has overturned a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unidentified place.
(The StVO says, however, this is not a milder condition - the linker has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra strip, afterwards .)
The pedestrian is injured after his submission to the hospital.
According to police reports, the linker suffered a shock, then put his functions back and requested pensionation.
The Boedapest lawyer has initiated its investigations for the incident.
Atila Morvai also mentioned that the former police officer had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in Budapest in total of EUR 400 million. The money is intended to flow in education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented by cohesion funds. The credit contract over 100 million has been signed earlier, the current agreement concerns the use of the 200 million EUR granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be used for the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has totally granted EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million is later decided in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting partners signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mostly flow in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
During the meeting, the U-Bahn line 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has explained the details of U-Bahn funding with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-debated.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR-binding, the loan is provided by the EIB with a suspension of 8 years, free of provisions.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradies of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fantastic - all of Europe looks carefully at the previously rarely mentioned Balkans country.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, which becomes more expensive?
An analysis of Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently doubtless the most desired patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with favourable ski appartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, Albena, the "Gold Coast", and the historical towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but property around Kavarna and Balcik are even more and more asked.
According to the estimates of Re/Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the country's internals also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the excellently favourable area of Russians, more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer the highest earnings.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists alongside the summer and winter season in the two other seasons.
Foreseeable investors are therefore already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized real estate by EUR 50-100.000, or downcoming houses by EUR 5-15,000, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are largely written, but also close to a large city, businesses and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category belongs to those who are looking for a vacation domicile (Bulgaria was listed in December under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group forms business people who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term value increase.
However, real estates in the capital are constantly expensive, subject to the ever growing demand.
Within the EU, although the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, there has been a price increase of 21 per cent annually over the past five years.
The cost of the real estate prices exceeds the increase in the wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for Environment, Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting Bali’s driving plan, in which the emissions reduction measures are set for the period after 2012, namely after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a vigorous debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 1990 by 2020.
The other important question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technically in addition to the reduction of emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-headed Council, expected to be in the UN's Global Environmental Facility (GFF) as it is read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary’s six percent
Minister for Environment, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), whether or not the "after 2012 agreement" will be achieved successfully or not, the Union would even be willing to use a 30% reduction, provided that other large industrial states, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments according to forces and responsible.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU and its 15 Member States had already committed to a minus of 8%.
The standard for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a standard that will fully meet the country as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The use is high on Bali - nevertheless, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012; in this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, which also highlighted the importance of the IPCC, the international, with the peace nobel price excellent scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for popularity increase on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have since March 2006 loaded videos about operations against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The thumbnail cameras rotated with helmets will be controlled at the air weapon base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already accomplished 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been considered more than 75,000 times.
The UK Defense Ministry was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace troops (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Defense Ministry says, the contributions also serve to inform the population about the real objectives of foreign interventions.
This kind of propaganda published is almost free from conventional television advertising, so Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in themselves, since they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censured recordings, also create in the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the something hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken above, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos have already been loaded on the platform, but these "attack" have recently discovered the British.
The Americans, however, advocate the something different, namely, with the freely downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can drop into the skin of the soldier in the framework of a more or less life-through simulation.
Christmas with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministry
Minister of Lamperth's work is in no way impressive: instead of a Christmas festival, she organises a work conference where her employees can climb with coffee and pogatsche in 2007.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, other soft Christmas voting with Tombola or attacks in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas voting, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held in the defence resort, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Wedding Festival of the Ways" children are awarded by fallen soldiers, while the "Missionsfeier" is being awarded family members of soldiers currently stationed in abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides approximately 25 million for the holidays.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport are struggling over the strings.
The 4,32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The sale rentals were 1 million forint, the rest was released for the more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas festival organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the celebration, the building of the Lust Game Theater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the constituents.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas festival on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rents to the OIT for the use of spaces.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivals were opened with a minister's speech, after which dinner live music was to dance.
At the request of [origo], there was no ball clothing or dressing obligation on the ball.
The Ministry of Health, Work, and Self-Administration are preparing for purite celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400 000 forint.
Lamperth, Minister of Lamperth, officially invites her employees not to a Christmas festival, but to the annual conference.
It is calculated with approximately 180 guests who, in view of the press department, are only held with coffee and pogatsche, the celebration is 350.000 forint.
Minister of Self-Administrative Affairs, Gordon Bajnai, will just join with his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas festival in its own hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 Forint per head - about this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incentives.
Since the beginning of the office of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party support - not only because of the Minister's official speech, but also because the festival was held for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a new year's reception on the 20th century, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is this time.
The hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort's information, the expenditure are measured with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple stamp, to which only accredited foreign diplomas are loaded in Hungary.
The receptions organised each year are traditionally starting with a short speech of the minister and sounding with retaining moulds.
As reported by the appropriate press offices on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education.
Asked for the cost of Christmas, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were charged to celebrate the art museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant stripes
The Liga Federations and the Hungarian Federation will form their Coordination Committee on Monday's Strict of Unspecified Duration on Friday.
On Saturday a protest-gross meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the people's vote to the Health Insurance Act - the workdown begins.
It is estimated that there are significant transport disabilities related to stress, as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and also the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) are struggling until 13 o'clock.
Details of the stretch on Monday will be jointly announced by the Liga Federation and the Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strict Committee is also established, responsible for the coordination of the action on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest-gross meeting will be held, and from Monday on, all organisations who have joined the stroke will put down the work for an indefinite time, provided that there is no agreement with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call on the strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the Strict Committees meet together to discuss the further approach.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it comes to the vote on the health insurance law only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
Through the stress that starts on Monday, you will have to expect significant transport disabilities: the railways put their work down for an undetermined time, the morning the majority of public transport resources and more than half of the volán companies are still.
At the same time, there will be many locations of motorway locking in a direction.
The call for strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is continuously updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced stress at an indefinite time, others planned a temporary employment reduction.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Federation of the VDSZSZ Railway, although just about Christmas holidays, more and more people are on the road.
According to previous reports, the BKV from Operation Start to 13 a.m., at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are set down the work for four hours, and the Teacher Federation e.g. called the Democratic Teacher Federation for 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association struggles all-country alternating at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Federation of Employees in Health and Social Affairs, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Cooperation Forum of the Federations, holds a two-hour warning series.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will take place from the next year.
Inquiry No. 3 is that the claimable professional groups are allowed to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ, belonging to the League Federations, did not accept the offer concerned by the Transport Ministry and now call for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garde increases state risk
According to the Department of Risk Analysis (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garde founded in August with the support of the "moving for a better Hungary" have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Garde, the highest political risk represents the "shareing of the existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeuner and non-Zigeuner population in Hungary, which could even lead to short-term ethnic conflicts".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Garde, which probably aims at the provocation of such conflicts, is the research institution.
As reported, this is considered as the failure of the political officers: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarn's opposite."
It is suspected that this would strengthen the problem that makes reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Garde, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary in abroad significantly harms, in particular as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has continued to rise, so several organisations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded since summer 2007.
"These groups are meant to define themselves as civil organizations each, while they openly praise to prepare their members - sometimes armed - defense tasks (castrophic protection, national defense, order protection), under appeal of the uncertainty of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And then, all this happens according to the method that is trying to take different political and party-based political efforts as a citizens' initiative.
The emphasis on civil nature and the form of association is therefore not only the reverse of legal obstacles that could appear in the context of the registration of the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis can be found, the activities of the Hungarian Garde also constitute a risk-increasing factor for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In the last few months, the Hungarian Garde has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy in the emergence of the Hungarian Garde.
This all has an impact on the political stability of the region" - said it.
In view of the research institution, the establishment of the Hungarian Garde is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Legal Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian Garde, the Roma Mass Excursions, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents equally for the purpose of establishing the National Garde, with the argument that the objective of the organisation of "national protection".
In the past 17 years, they believe that it has been apparent that the state has remained unfair and unprecedented - so political capital.
And further, the initiative would have disappeared a vigorous debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to base their own garden for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Garde have shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also responds to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk change trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not every holiday
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days has now been established around the holidays, but the next year will reduce the number of days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood under "Feastday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployed days.
Workless days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate a new year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the last one can rest with the silvester captives alone.
All the year we have fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are on March 15, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and on October 23, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the state foundation, celebrating the work on 1 May, we remember our dead ones on 1 and 2 November.
In addition, there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecosts, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been defining in its own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, public employees and officials of the public service.
Except are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
Heuer, the work order is only brought together by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December the life to this country remains formally, as most of the days between Christmas and Silvester take time compensation, or the holidays that have been lifted up for it.
During the next year, more holidays fall into the week centre, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less re-disposals at the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed on the head around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal is associated with the holiday on October 23: Saturday, October 18th, you will have to finish Friday, October 24th.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the holidays, after everything is lying and remaining from 24 December, even when silvester falls on Wednesday.
Six absurd minorities to irritate employees
E-mails we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" in the everyday workplace.
The question is simply whether you are used to these little inconveniences, or you are better faced with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding, consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
In best cases, you regret it and try to regain it again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and repentantly standing, you forgot to post the message (this is the less usual method).
Mostly, the matter is abandoned with a excuse.
Before breaking up in a tough explanation, you should consider what you can really prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Do you borrow something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There is hardly a little more nervous than if you take a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the lift was still on the desk - today is it gone early?
Or is the lost believed bullet writer discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without question, you should not borrow yourself from the colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it put out of the office in the pocket, because it could happen to yourself: nothing more if you need it urgently.
Threatling about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a traffic that has already been put into the world.
Who did what?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or suspects) about the private life of colleagues, if possible, to everybody's nose!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best thing is to sweat as a grave, instead of aligning the people who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported without a reason sick?
If you call in the office to report sickly on annoying headaches because you feel uncomfortable or just want to rest, you should be aware of one: your own work, inconvenience, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with the colleagues!
If you know the previous day that you will not get it to the office next day, or that something could intervene, why you need to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted with the absence indefinitely.
Total, Kicker, Telephone
You're just deep in his work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud cock of the colleagues?
I don't want to listen to a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard.
The colleagues should not be nervous with sums, singing, loud conversations (which are leading over their heads), tramps, persistent shamping or nargles.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes, and if others were affected, apologize!
The question of how to regain the error, or the missing one, is just all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training shoes and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but hasn't lost anything in the office!
Not even then you should dress so much less if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself as far as you dress yourself in the office accordingly - if you wish, also beautiful and elegant!
It wants all to make it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio a strange melody: the sound of a gee, coupled with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The pace changes, to the sounds of the past, the bass comes, and as a real sound jewel a female core.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which clings to mr2.
The home music scene has long not just devoted us to qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the stable different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene, slowly contributes to a change of the overall image, and even if the garagenrock is back "in" with its guitar requisite, the homeic Electropop demonstrates: There is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, musiced even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a hostel does not carry two pipes - began to cry his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that merged elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, however, only when he came to him with the request to compose the soundtrack into a movie (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, initially in smaller clubs, was only known to the broader audience when the magazine "wan2" shortened its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to almost the only, even marketable trend set in the west.
Without doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested if they liked to carry this brand.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would be all right, but in addition to the etheric character of the music, the time spirit and trends were the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligti, who lives in England and works with the "The Puzzle" band, presented himself at the Premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even been able to be a radio-slaughter - which has been sent from the newest of Pop music from early to late, Mr2 Pet\fi has set the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which has been taken with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), successively to the earworm.
So it's okay (?).
The hvg.hu has asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: In what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "lay music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in Pop music, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and Pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sight and nonsense, but they can also be produced only for sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from a honest motive.
The listener's admission will also work in accordance with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In abroad, especially west of us, the pop music has a bigger tradition.
There is not only teenagers or Twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentionful because they also think it is part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly evident in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but they are in turn only in the unreasonable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing I noticed is that if you want to make it right to all, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a solist and has built his career in the west rather.
B. Zs: We're not really going his way, except that you're always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
In the beginning, our work was of course comparable to the one that Yonderboi made, as several of us came out of his band and struck another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a little more popular style in the direction of a wider audience consciously focused?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, then to hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the soundorgie and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just she, what was the lead principle?
B. Zs.: The basic thought was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from talented solists of the domestic music scene.
So the six-headed choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song like that, or did the girls make it with?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number was "non-needing".
The order of accord has formally demanded a vocal vote.
I've sung the melody in the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on the face and awful spontaneous.
I remember that I was quite electricized at that time, but it has already needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate, and at the concert, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, singing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They were also standing behind on the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of pure technical problems.
However, we consciously didn't want to let them get to solo rolls.
The number is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who's coming from where and where we're going, we just allow these certain wings to raise the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most demanding song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creation work, more difficult tasks have been done when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove wanted to not work anymore, but sometimes everything has joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts running and also now where I have the album "lost".
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceit Makler risked billions of minority feelings
Soilless fraud
So his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the present Komerční banka.
It came for almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it equally to his colleagues, in addition, certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all large banking houses, he recognised in time the crisis on the American hypothectic market.
"He's more mentally weak," was to hear from the mouth of his officers who showed him at the police.
However, as shown in the statements of Kerviel, the French media, such as the Le Monde Day News, published, was a man who had achieved its business profits at EUR 1.6 billion in the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he managed to earn a half billion euros just at the American crisis.
Because he had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was the first news that so-called sub-Prime Hypothecs, such as the low income customers or those who had previously had paying problems, would be put into trouble.
However, this crisis should not be influenced on the whole of the economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," he admits and continues that he definitely had nothing for himself.
During the interview, he admits that he has faked documents so that you can't get him on the fool.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfies the simple fact that I earned 1,6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he finished his study at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years, he was already assistant of a maker and in 2005 he became an independent dealer with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never deserve as much as others.
"On my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Ker viel explained the investigative officer.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on course losses of this title at the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you
"That's like a snowball," he said the policeman.
But the bossss said they knew everything, or or did.
"As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes."
But then the great battle came at the beginning of this year.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros for it.
And how did they come to him?
He suspiciously made himself through a vacation.
"I took only four days of the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to watch him in the cards," said Kerviel finally.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed all nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion in the next few years (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion kroner from the "corporation and innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "corporation and innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funds for innovative businesses.
In this way, companies will win funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The previous EU fund money acquisition is one of the most successful among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguanic Court confirms twenty-year penalty for Presidents
On Thursday, a procedural court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, which he had been condemned in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (approximately $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguic metropole.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) will return to this Central American State, according to the AP news Agency, is currently unclear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to leave Alemán his punishment at home or whether he must be in prison.
A court pointed out four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of these funds finally landed in a fund established by Alemán for the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is by:
Yeah, it's done.
The national budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted by the majority of coalition without support of the opposition.
It was still approved for the current year with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could therefore not allow him to reject.
Unlike the vigorous debate before the vote on the mistrust request against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary house approved this traditionally unobserved, yet very important law in all peace.
That's some paradox.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy but is covered by the government's and opposition's power struggle.
This is a more grateful to the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than narrowing figures.
The national budgets were under three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which cannot eliminate the 2008 budget at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure obliged by law, which is not only the pensions but also social expenditure which the "suspendant" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness point.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the largest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
But a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many Mayors used to capture other sources of investment, except revenue from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often unconvinced debt debt debts which they owed in excess of their councils.
In recent years, they managed to pay these debts through mass sales of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already decorated.
As far as we only observe official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for a few years, like the rest of the world, has run through a growth phase, whose ČSSD is unleashed.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to settle public finances.
Instead, these governments, however, debted the State more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, in global terms, are at least threatened by poverty.
That is why no massive social programmes are needed, which have, unfortunately, in the last few years, been exaggerated in a gigantic scale.
Even though it has been successful to eliminate a part of the unfair population expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the next time it does not come to a shift of the retirement age and to a pension reform, practically any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but pure managers.
It is only easily overdriven if you say that then, from dominant politicians, they will become officials, which mechanically divide most of the tax revenue on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only give rise to the discontinuation of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would be overwhelmed if former governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was only going on.
If we do not want it to really come to be pure administrative officers from dominant politicians, we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to accept taxes and fees in order to wish peace when preparing further reform laws.
Only these enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to tackle crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in financial markets together.
In this way, more than $100 billion will come to the currency markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it locker for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or the mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can grant," wrote a report for its customers Bernard Baumhl from the Economic Outlook Group's consultative company.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added cotton in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can happen when they decided to do this," said the Chef of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have hard access to loans, loans will also be expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and the American economy would fall into a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have not been able to reduce the LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate, which is used in the loan of funds between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, and that even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had decreased their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the upheating of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, which is the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Claus: The discussions of ecologs are unbelievable
Global climate change claims to harm developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus said again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism was now referring to the UN Conference on Climate Change on Bali at the end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he concluded that the debates of the ecologs were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetorics they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fire, which is only replaced for a real solution of current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the imagination of his book that his topic is very important for him and that he is thus engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
So now, interested parties could read his attitude unconverted.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climate toologist, but he thinks he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and be a nationalist.
As the main statement of the book, he mentioned the Theses that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, so it is not a consensus among scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are overlapping, effective and unacceptable.
In addition, he believes that it is a person who has experiences with totalitarian systems that is unacceptable to force other unannounced views, he considers that this is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists, who do not consider the relationship between effort and profit."
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers failed to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities create a new driving licence until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after a new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers go on the roads without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, mostly those who do not want to drive have changed their licence.
While small places report a strong decline in the interests of the frontier exchange, the offices of the capital are overwhelmed with applications, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration will complete around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand up for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not changed their driving licence yet.
The exhibition a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 kroner.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without valid driving licence are threatening a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2000 kroner.
However, the police can also make it use of an admonition when infringements.
In the case of a infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, a punishment cannot be imposed by the community.
He could threaten a punishment of even $30,000.
The Ministry already called the Officers to let mild manage and to punish a punishment of 1,000 kroner.
The speaker of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka, said no one threatens a thousand crowns punishment.
The licence is a document where everyone can decide whether he wants it or not.
It is not a personal certificate that everyone, who is valid, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality office or to send him to it by subscription.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million further driving licences.
Judgment lowers penalties for detectives who were bound to Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Petr Koěařík, who were accused of having made a joint matter with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of prison.
This was decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced their penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amt for the fight against organised crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today's judgment, there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but he is first before the first judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already received 16-year penalties.
Too far, he cannot be condemned.
In January 19 people were guilty of a District Court, especially because of participation in robbery, and today the Oberland Court negotiated the call of 16 of them.
From the beginning, most accused persons objected to the accusation with the reasoning, it was a constructed case.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, members of the police in agreement with Berdych criminals provided information from the sources of the police, covered various robbery attacks and helped members of the band to withdraw the criminal persecution.
The band left Opava and Koěařík for this purpose 30 per cent of the boats.
The complaint concerns the offences of the bonds from 1999 to 2001.
Especially on robbery, whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also on office measures and unauthorised weapons possession.
In the case of home searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target pipe and a machine gun.
The band has, according to its robbery, enriched many millions of crowns.
In addition, nearly 20 men in this procedure recognized the courts of Berdych and a number of others due to other robbery attacks than guilty.
Other men from Berdych's circuit must be responsible for another process, other cases have not yet been brought before court.
The main negotiation has so far been to the end of Tomáš P
Children exchanged - Invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, will require 12 million kroner compensation from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each mother every three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore does not fully agree with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it lies to a multifold too high," said Dostál after the today's negotiation.
"In order to make an opinion on this counter proposal, however, we need the advice that the opposite made.
We'll find out whether it's at all worth of statement.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands together for everyone," said Dostál.
The amount should move between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablo'ov wanted a million kroner for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for remuneration negotiations was an opinion that had worked for him the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children believe that experts in psychology and psychiatrie suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men better deceived the stress situation, even if they saw claims against them that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
Again, the women are worse with the reactions of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is going on right now, Veleba merged the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged hospitals in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloıov.
The head of the district of Vysočina (bohemian-marian height) passed over 100000 kroner in the late October of each family as a replacement for the expenses generated by the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the case of doubt, they need to reach a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance to the body.
Until now, the courts have referred to low amounts of compensation, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his Kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Königreich Walachei".
The judge at Ostrava District Court said he used the first name "Walachish King", but the project had built up a team of Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actress in long-year work.
Polívka was not part of the negotiation today.
But according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not ended and his client will probably call.
"The dispute concerns that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka parasitary," said Polívkas lawyer after negotiation.
The words "Walkish Kingdom" just represented this actress and comics.
The same opinion is Harabiš.
"We have a nearly ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
He says that the cause is a dispute about money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasitely on our work," he continued.
Appropriate business
According to the Court, Polívka used the name "Walachish King" for the first time in one of its television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But it was not then associated with the intention of justifying a fictional Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to think that he was going to spend walachic passports.
From an original fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystalged out, which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walkish Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka accepted the use of his name and signature in the passports and offered their owners even reductions when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" shipment for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walach Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team who had dedicated him intensely.
The collaboration of the controversial parties today took place until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka organized the official crown in Vsetín.
But since then, Polívka and Harabiš began to raise the disputes that were elected in the settlement "König Boleslavs I. until the Sankt-Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership role then applied to Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka rejected Harabiš and his company the complaint that the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the contest prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
This would lead to a new king.
Details and a date he didn't want to tell yet.
"We don't want to hurry.
It should be like the kingship in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in with it quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Snow predefinitely
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not worthwhile, the quality of gang stopping, direction and also the processing could be described as rather under average.
But now his follower, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is for much better.
The combi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just remain to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low head freedom on the back seats.
These disorders are no longer available, because the combi's carrosserie is designed so that not even two meters will suffer.
Quick Continue
I'm just going through the internal equipment shortly to not repeat myself too much.
It is a pretty successful design where I have only objections because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designal design, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over which we may complain about too short seats or head supports.
The side content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
With regard to the space supply, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carrosserie.
In the combi, the deficit of head freeness already mentioned is also eliminated.
Basket in the suitcase room
But the main case on this car is the charging room.
I must mention this (also because of the expandable back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The hollow rooms are equipped with housing belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They are not interrupting, distracting and keeping more difficult items.
But let's talk about the load volume.
It is according to the table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, in comparison with the most sold vehicles in Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains back with clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when a child car is invited.
But to highlight the positive ones, I still have to mention the very flat charging room or the very low load edge after the back seat is wrapped.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzine engine with Hubraum 1.6 litres and a 88 kWp performance.
And honestly, a 1600-cubic engine should look like a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes acts like his excavation with a lap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just national.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 kroner is still at stake.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is quite much already.
The equipment Premium of the test cart will beat with 80000 kroner in addition to books.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic dishwasher dissolution, electric windows behind and and...
Thus, the car costs totally light 531900 kroner.
This is a lot, but you can count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which mark you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from the countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, which leads to the further development of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has hitherto come to a number of obstacles.
British schools even determine cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Conflicts, chicans and robbery among students have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron stack.
The defendant defended that the boy had insulted her with racist discouragements.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls claimed to have made racist comments to the man and made it with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and sucked on us.
When I told him that he should stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then uncovered his seat," a mother of Slovak student of the newspaper The Times wrote another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the indigenous mentioned the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The cases mentioned prove that the mood between residents and immigrants in British schools is increasingly exciting.
In the United Kingdom, 70000 Slovaks have been reported to come here on their job search.
Consequently, about 30000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will meet if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet like a dawn.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellars offering on the beach of Pizza, ice and devastating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you can find this in abundant scale.
Only on an island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or a transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American Epoch came.
The Nacional Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
Construction made it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was enjoyed and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew over the wide Boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanna, and in Cojimar he was hunting.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
The bar at the Nacional Hotel is mixed for you Cocktails all for wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty are going around in Havana until today, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats in the salty and damp air have long broken.
May Havanna, especially his oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere in the circuit as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just poured out, for example Trinidad.
In order to ensure that tourism brings money needed urgently, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only new hotels have been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar tube of distant plants brought steam and diesel-operated snailways to the sugar plants.
Her Fuhrpark has not been renewed over decades, and then there are pure and fully functioning locomotives, whose older companions are abroad in the museum.
Excursion targets
The most important places do not leave the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It remains only to mention that in Hemingways already mentioned, a museum should not be avoided by the visitor who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most painting corners of Cuba.
The luxurious vegetation grows on limestone floors.
The Mogotas, calculus hills and felsens, stuck up from the valley floor, gathered into their hollow rooms into fruitable soil, which also covers decorated rock areas of dense occupation.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco may be cultivated.
In his final form you can meet on him if you visit one of the cigarette factories of Havana.
Some may also seem interesting that there was the chilenic consequence of the "Major Zeman" television series.
Trinidad
A old town, which was founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
Praise and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugars.
The wealth appeared in the delightful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain, is such a distant place that there was no road there in the fifty years of the last century that the area would have connected to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unobserved.
Nothing was built there, but so nothing was cut off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of the sugar factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after darkness, and where the music does not weaken until the morning.
Baracoa
This town all in the east of Cuba refers to some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, leading by Guantánamo there, must overcome high and crushed mountains and walk through a landscape that is hardly affected by human interventions.
This eastern pre-post of Cuba took the UNESCO into its World Heritage directory thanks to the unaffected nature there.
There the best chocolate is manufactured, in the church it is shown the cross of Columbus (in fact it has been about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillao, stands, are seen several table mountains of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig book and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the Holy Decree of the Cuban Patrone Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, a African religion to which the descendants of slaves are confessed, about all this could be written on many pages.
But as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claiming Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, the NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, it was agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh to the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating countries also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by their Defense Minister Robert Gates, called on the NATO units to more activity, the United Kingdom considers the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is evident, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to begin even a further development of the economy and security," says British Des Browne Defense Minister of BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan Sustainers has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence action has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even 60 per cent.
The NATO countries stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the allies have hit an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they require additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, today the NATO Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop, expressed himself.
"I am not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little," said De Hoop of the Agency Reuters to conclude three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In the last few months, among the countries involved, there is also a dispute about whether all all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as faulpelze this week.
"Afghanic non-surfaced: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers, the Tischtennis play.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a backby fight in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will speed up to a billion in 2009
Each Czech is a government debt of 84000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner until the end of September.
The government planned to debt this year with 159,2 billion cones.
However, in early December, thanks to the better development of public budgetary policies, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The government debts of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion kroner until the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its indication of State debts from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the last year, the state debted more than 111 billion kroner.
"To now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may only exceed the limit of a billion kroner in 2009.
Next year, the debts should move between 900 billion and a billion kroner," said David Marek, Analytics of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, Analytics of the Next Finance, sees: "For override of a billion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should show that the situation is changing on the political stage and politicians should be ready to save more, this could take up until 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he noted.
Growth of debt
State debt is caused by the debts of the government and comes mainly from the settlement of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by tax instructions, government debts, direct loans or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic government debt increased to 719.4 billion kroner.
The State's foreign debts have now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average duration of government debts increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much because of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is particularly reported in debt debt descriptions where the growth is 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debts increase, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The funding strategy and the management of government debts for 2007 shows that the government planned to take up 159,2 billion kroner for this year.
However, at the beginning of December, thanks to the better development of public budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to government deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum fund for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debts for 43 billion and the rates for loans at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan for injury of Islam, was sentenced by a court in Khartum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent excursion.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She'd have deserved to be poured out.
Following multiple complaints from students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused by Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal lawbook of the contempt of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes her beginning in September when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classenteddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school director Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children Mohammed choose as the favorite first name.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common prename in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself had no sign with that name, but the problem is very simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as the insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything to bring her close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
A opinion that shares many students of the teacher who describe them as very careful to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class of religion.
It is noted that the first name of Mohammed is the second most common name given in Britain, for which there are 14 different writings in English.
This prename, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this prename?
Can you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their controversials about the future status of the separateist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not agree on the status , explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina called on to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violent acts are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of communications on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia in themselves, will meet on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo for a last time.
The future of the province of Albanian speaking to 90% could be clear when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The discussions of baths, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August, the UN had received the order for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their contract to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, will continue the negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains prosecutor of a negotiated solution, an agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral independence declaration?
After Kosovo has been under the UN administration for eight years, the Western countries believe that independence is the only solution with the future under EU supervision.
Pristina is willing to announce this one-sided if the Security Council should not decide for its benefit.
Belgrade is on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past leading to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
On his part, Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that a compromise should always be pursued and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral independence declaration of the Province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly creates a "domino effect" in a region that has been so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had relied on that any decision was taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian alliance has a veto law.
The House of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia , explained Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have started: at the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that each one-sided declaration of independence from the Albanian speaking population will expire in coordination with the western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israeli and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final regulation of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace contract before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up its colonisation work, Bush explained, reminding the two parties of their obligations with regard to the timetable for peace which they agreed in 2003.
The Chairman of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, at the end of the end, are aimed at a peace agreement that will clear all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This name includes the three grave problems that the disputes between Israeli and Palestinians are mainly rotating: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were displaced from their home in the context of the conflict of 1948 in the present state of Israel.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas took the word and relied on that the next negotiations were fully and thoroughly conducted and provided a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word on his part, he committed himself to conducting the future arms resilience negotiations directly and without interruption and to attempt that they can be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two countries , a Palestinian and a Israelite who is next to each other, before the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received an insurance in this sense of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Eastjerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossway in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, the Saudi Arab Prinz in his interview with the Arabical newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the lawyer, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local messages, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the national disciplinary authority of the police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 a.m., a police car on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without authorisation, thus not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its procurement from the right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol controls carried out in the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The condition of the car (reflected cotfly, splashed windscreens, cut off stalks) proves the stainlessness of the splash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the state lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she confided to the IGPN a survey on the "Fakts of unwilling person murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main management for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the state lawyer explained that it excludes the responsibility of the police at this stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard on Sunday evening, have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small wheel has reached relatively fast on her left side.
Yesterday, a kind of ribs, certainly caused by the riving of the footbreaks on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained broken together until the police were able to brake.
The vehicles have been captured and will be subject to technical assessment.
The likenames of the two victims were obductioned yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour made the round, as a result of the police would have left the accident very quickly, and that, without helping the two youths.
Although IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude this matter on any serious mistakes.
According to one police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and must be careful .
Libération has hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, this Witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed policeman hanging.
Two others tried to relive one of the youths, the fourth phoned .
In view of the excitement that was rapidly educated and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the present people had about the unforgettable situation of young people, the police of colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken into the car.
Still, according to this Witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police leave.
They have also used heart massages, but forgively.
I won't allow it to be claimed that the police forces wouldn't have helped youths.
These young people have been first assisted.
The firearm has come right away.
It was all done to try to save her, stressed herself the state lawyer.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistanian police have defeated the first demonstrations since two days earlier, General Musharraf had been called out for the emergency.
According to witness statements, some 2,000 lawyers in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country, who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, were injured by the tear gas grains that the order forces put there.
After that, they threw stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and hurt.
More people would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court called on a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositional, human rights warrants and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Other demonstrations had been found in Multan (Medte) and in Peshawar (Nordosten).
On Monday, the lawyer's movement received the support of the religious parties united in the mighty council of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose President invited the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency, and to those who left an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer applicable
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure that was announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's reselection in a position in direct election on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and in contrast to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the superior command on the army and to become a civil president is no longer valid since the call of the emergency, explained on Monday of the Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as President.
The Minister for Information also confirmed that the elections of January could be suspended.
In addition, the Pakistanian government declared the reputation of the country’s hardnicking reputations, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his vice-president army leader.
More than one third of the pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Newwirth Act which allowed the contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancy (24%), as well as the bad or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception prevention such as the pill or the spirals still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pillar users aged between 20 and 40, increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of the contraception prevention has, however, made it possible to improve the control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
In one of five pairs even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have used more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for continuing scientific work at the station.
A guarded exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of resident modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools designed by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the Astronauts had charged the Harmony module Discovery from the spaceway, a large cylindrical part, which soon will take into account the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labore.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17,5 tonnes heavy module for the production of electricity via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew made itself to restructuring the solar collectors of the module whose range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, who are folding up like acordeone, was damaged by a cable sticked on a length of about one meter.
Restructuring has been stopped to no longer damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left Discovery for a control, and then repaired another sun collector whose rotation system was incorrect, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arms of the space carriage, which was placed on the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistable, very well-sensitive, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully reviewing the damage, he separated the malicious cable and mounted a kind of rail at the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who stayed near the sluice, and, by inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used to prevent an electric stroke, the astronauts on board the station had thought and betted on the sun collectors, which generated several hundred volts, to prevent an electric stroke.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded up before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the Astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spaceway today to expect Wednesday to enter the return to the earth.
The title EADS sanctified at the stock exchange
After announced that the air navigation and defence group will have to spend EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion in order to counteract the residues of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to EUR 21.96 at the Paris exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again in relation to the progressive development of the A400M engine’s engine, which delays the fly’s virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport plane amount to EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus , announced the EADS mother group.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
To remember, the EADS' business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had foreseen a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to tell the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very declined election struggle, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even for authoritarism.
Three days before parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the public broadcasters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate of the United Russian, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory announces.
Yesterday the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors and satisfaction to deliver a new attack point against the West powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hoped we have honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they got there.
It pranges a electoral struggle that is under pressure.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty choices, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations in the last weekend, Ex-Schachweltmeister Garry Kasparovder has been convicted for unauthorized demonstrations to five days in prison, according to his lawyer continues to visit ban.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without excitement, two further questions are raised:
Who will join Putin's success as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was reselected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot come to a third mandate.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of Parliament and the Allmighty Party of the United Kingdom of Russia, the government and President will choose?
Whatever it will be, at the parliamentary or presidential elections, the power that has been made will triumphate.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St Petersburg even further declines: The civil society has been very slowly developed in this country, which has been christianized to Europe in five centuries; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has relinked to the model of a patriarch state, which was fully accepted by the population, so more, since this new patriarch was not a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Mary Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces dismiss the personal responsibility they have taken to the attention shortly after the destruction of the USSR.
How long do you think about it?
This phenomenon concerns all societal layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to maintain the status of Quo: 65 governors (from 85 Russian presidencies) launch the local election lists of the United Russian Federation.
The new freedoms coming from the west are often similar to chaos, as in the 1990s.
Generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not also vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What's more about?
Those who are in power aren't so bad why they dissolve?
A Heavy Remembrance
After being treated confidentially over 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the destiny of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were placed in Bad Arolsen on a total length of 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, that is individually and named, i.e. on the request of a former victim or his family.
The eleven countries, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, responsible for their administration, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heavy information
The access of the historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inhabitants of the concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Master, director of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICCR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the thickness of certain information.
For example, the claimed homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been compiled for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced work, and may provide them with a means of proof of their arrest in order to make them the way to their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are still editing tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is no basic new expectation in these documents, Mr Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006, has explained.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is the most important trade partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European trade minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations in order to sign Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is the first trading partner of India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A Free Trade Pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, as the European Commissioner continued to explain. The Asian and European giants exchange every year goods in the value of EUR 47 billion and services in the value of EUR 10 billion, this week had Daniéle Slamja, chairman of the European Commission's regulation in New Delhi, explained and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet been exhausted. The EU and India will be present on Friday to their eighte diplomatics in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the disturbance and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recursive concerns about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, a offer with an unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears of which the conditions on the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way they are to organize their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its spare deposits during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks , in a communication.
The Bank continues to explain that, on 6 December, 10 billion Pounds (14 billion euros) are put into circulation by GMT 12.15, to the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE brings liquids into circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of the interbanked loans with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The different inter-Bankan interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been penetrated to 6.6%, a little higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis from summer, the sums put in circulation by the Bank of England were linked to penalties that the banks had prevented from taking advantage of them.
According to certain reputations, strengthened by the development of the pound price, in contrast to the euro, many were in favour of signing for the sums of the European Central Bank, to more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to check the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist law for purchasing power, which is the same as rejection of the text.
The text produced under a socialist Nish (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) gave about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which most of 50% was added to employment, to re-introduction of the TIPF fleetant, to a transport check or to limit rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered partially severe word exchanges between majority and opposition occasion, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy about the purchase force.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the overall of its proposals as a amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the financial resources that had been reviewed last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous reputations regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British Producer Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and not less, served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 communicated on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campsite holidays.
The festival will probably take place on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia on August 8, 10th.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80 000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his property as a co-owner, has also cared for the production of the license concessions and the organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been with, says that his company and Melvin Benn work together to offer a festival event in European style.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and work zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately we stayed in police debates about current management, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we take preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will eventually benefit the population."
The Lollapalooza Festival in the Grand Park Chicago in 2005 has been resurrected by C3 Presents after it has been profiled in the world of the Festival together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events have been able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in the year 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours take place rather on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in the one or another in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the Mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to prize the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasty rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator is opposed.
These lock attempts belong to the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles mandate", because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who calls "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who think the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the priorities of the preliminary application of the cinema there are at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars started.
At all the festival at the west coast, although that of Sundance, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about imagining the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers are interviewing.
The dark age had a successful idea on the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short movies at the American Film Institute Festival.
Does the stock exchange stand a end-year rally before? Unanimity with the experts due to the U.S. hypothecrisis
With almost five weeks to the annual account at the stock exchange, investors are already swinging their hands with regard to the coming end-year rally.
Nonetheless, experts cannot produce safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically viewed, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to produce short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not accept such a strong rate increase in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest in safe share funds mainly in pension funds, which are highly affected by the valuable trend of assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the burden will rather be shown a more lateral, market fluctuations influenced, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline of the interest rate of the US Note Bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased price of raw oil and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the BPI Sales Department in Spain, agrees that it is a guardful time to announce a future market rally.
The chances are not very good, insured by the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyzed at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional contribution of the pension fund each year.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year the things could develop something different; especially because of the end-year rally that is already in the second December week, and therefore directly after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price variations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyzed by the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments on the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to the nearest deviation of the index values, which depending on the consequences of the US hygiene market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values to promote the Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney declines that this year are the big values in the series.
One of the value winners would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
At the same time, Federico Olucha by the Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the bank and industry sector.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS was on a pick-up course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will be in the same way, as the expert says.
As regards increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive turnover results, even if they are represented in the Spanish market only in a small number.
Five times in seven years
Over the last seven years, December only showed decreasing courses in two cases.
At the end of 2003, the technology flower led the burden from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 picked up at 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winner year in success (the Ibex increases by 8.36% since January) and also shows a final year's rally.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institution that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these establishments are a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group is the hops to extend the opening hours of his branches weekly to 20 o'clock and to take on Saturday from 10h to 20 o'clock.
The BBVA Banking Group, who also repeatedly rejected the extension of its opening hours in the establishments, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement with 75% of all branches on Saturday and open for it on a week afternoon, even if not for customers.
Whether further banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening hours will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And just that is the intention that popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their situation, can take account of the purchasing customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large buyers.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, because it is not new but changed opening hours.
For that purpose, the Bank will transform the rooms of those establishments already located in business zones and at the same time adjust them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more recent, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera ensures that the restructuring would not require larger investments, but a higher staff position, since a branch needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments which are even equipped with additional spaces for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences fell positively, says Ángel Rivero.
The establishments of the roads Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Via have been selected for what seems to be a wise decision.
Popular is currently leading about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening hours, even on sun and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With phoneica they have provisionally reached the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its exchange value for the first time and thus overcomes his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, declared satisfaction at the end of Börsen. The broadcaster led by him had increased its value by the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, damped his joy: That's exactly what's hurt me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we have fewer losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deeply.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its past this year's loss to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches the EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is only involved by 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has since January registered a total of 40,5%, so its market value is 2.93.46 million to half.
However, the market value of other exchange-notified communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, at Prisa (exhibitors of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears in what extent we can actually act on the exchange technique, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
For a week ago, Telecinco explained his project to increase this year to the first television broadcaster with more than 1,000 million gross wins from advertising revenue. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising rates by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net sales rate increased by 1.6% in the first nine exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net sales from television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for the better exchange rate of Telecinco compared sees the analysts at the high payout ratio that the company could show up until now: 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría led a 100-percent dividend payment.
Vasile, however, assures that after purchase of 33% of the shares of endmol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have been increasingly declared.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we could already increase by buying 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently shows some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers had recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, falling from 10,5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: puts on its high efficiency rate and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (coupling) is a more favourable position at antena 3 (holding) due to the many incentives and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to resume expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climates)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to parliamentary development, which was closed today with the congress decision in the Senate on the additional/change applications for the project, the government published the provisions of the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senates who were pursued in their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and to regulate individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure an overall efficient market performance.
The MIFID, which reassesses the system of investment services, in addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, aims at improving investor protection, increasing the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the consulting companies which cooperate with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of systems for carrying out financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the effect business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to register the focuss of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of handling risks on the market and all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congress Economic Commission has subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the debt debt debt declared with titles should now be considered as complex financial resources because of its high risk for the investor, confirmed by the US hypothecene and bank crisis. (US-Hypothec crisis).
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of diplomatized economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the work areas reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, as the economic mediator, who is working on foreign accounts, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and its services for commercialisation of products and for customer gain at the same time offer several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator served by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a local and quality comparison with US products by the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prematurely established by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) urged that the pre-determined indicator should only serve as a guide value and therefore not conform to the final result that is announced on the next 14 December.
Consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the vice-president of the government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November and at the same time assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the Halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, the inflation difference in Spain to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November there were fewer surprises than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates Northern Rock revenues of more than 42 billion euros in the next three years
The stocks of Northern Rock have decreased by more than half after the Bank had called for an emergency credit in the middle of September of the last year, the British Notenbank had called for an emergency credit, and they are currently only 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a high amount of 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly declined within two and a half months by the customer’s loss of trust and also despite the hundred percent guarantee of the government that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to fall.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, must spend about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be composed of the installations of the next three years, in order to acquire precisely those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goals of 30 billion.
The group of the multi-millionary Richard Branson, known by its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow 50.000 million pounds (approximately EUR 70 million) annually to flow in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Groups, in which three other companies are involved, than his preferred tenderer to lead it from the insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested because of a suspected suspicion of participation in urban corruption
Today, the Spanish police arrested the current burial champion of the town of Murcia (Partido Popular), because of the urgency of the suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently members of the Partido Popular and at then Chairman of the Board of Municipalities of Totana, and could be, according to information from the Cadena SER broadcaster, the original wiremaker of the complot.
The officials continue to examine the municipality's and the City Planning Ministry's business documents and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to Cadena SER information, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Members Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's seat due to important burdenful documents to be related to the complot.
In addition, other information sources report of the supposed order payments of Morale to a galician construction company which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares was decided.
At the moment, eight persons are in an investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidateature in Toledo and, cases of a election victory, at the congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will therefore take the office of the Congress President at the next General elections in Toledo.
It has thus announced José Blanco, the organisational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the headquarters of the party.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former ministers is justified, as it is important in policy to count on the best and to be among the best.
In addition, in the case of a victory from Mancha, the politician for the socialists in the coming elections would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced last 15 November that he would no longer join the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take up the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government has persistently urged his return to political events.
In addition , he pointed out that, like the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics , the party would not want to prevent the citizens who would take over the posts of the Congress President in the event of a election victory and called this a act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not to convey the innocentness or shout in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place where you cannot speak quietly and left in Madrid is the congress; the President of the Government was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to wake up the appearance that he had already taken the office, since otherwise his political counterparties would mention this as arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate undermines both the skeptics of climate change as well as those who put a social and political debate in the foreground of this, inevitable criticism, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
In particular, if it is a leader of movement, who, as in the case of the President of the Government, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even suggests to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in declaration note on the action, or non-handle of its government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries which have at least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-compliance with the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why his government, who had proposed the Treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present the Spanish citizens the measures planned by it against climate change without reverse.
The companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens to be changed, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences of these.
Exactly, who will have to sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will not be any such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented really against climate change are unloved.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE's proposed benzine century, Zapatero appeared to be so dangerous as to see it being forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now true to save the planets with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty words without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise suitable for election campaigns must not speak, neither accuse nor demand, but instead follow the demanding edition, decorate the meetings and enthusiasm with his meekness and kindness.
This can only be done if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with a factor.
The Mayor and the Police Chairman of Totana due to an anticipated involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the burial championship of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the Secretary of the Civil Office and a hotel entrepreneur have been conservated for the discreet suspicion of urban infringements, today called research circles.
The city council was arrested at his seat, from where it was brought to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by many agents who had also arrived at the urban administration and at the municipal construction leader Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the last Mondays in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished building grounds for urban projects should be redesigned under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the ground after local administration has arrived in illegal provision during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subject to a investigation procedure, which is initiated and implemented by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrestants have been presented to the judge today.
According to research circles, against the former Mayor of Totana and the current independent PP member Juan Morales is also identified.
In addition, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current, travelling friend in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company was supposed to have operated as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the cash.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban debts, under the supervision of the central unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out further eleven further investigations, most of them in companies which were directly linked to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry cultivation industry that should have acted as a median.
The construction group Nuaria was assigned to build the largest residential complex of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2,2 million square miles [2,2 million km] area to reconstruct it. The aim was to achieve a construction project which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which in Vigo operates the parking lots of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to find a price name other name with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, commented (Finnland is located at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; randomly on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the field of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy about the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a absurd who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
The chairman of the Educational Council for the philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on the teachers in an interview of the Day’s Newspaper Helsingin Sanomat to take a more critical position in relation to Platon and suggested that the teaching of Platon should be removed from the sub-level learning plans for the philosophy of gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a law break that will be encountered with six months of prison.
However, if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euro, this is only considered as a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, then the steal will be classified as a criminal offence, yet the penalty is lower than in a download (Article 234 criminal law).
C. If you quit a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to take part in a battle than a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious conflict, a prison penalty of three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 Criminal Code), while the data exchange has a withdrawal of freedom from six months to up to two years.
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the criminal lawbook, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not been performed by the authors is subject to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then someone has very much screwed up his claims.

My home physician gives me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: money leads to activating certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly pay are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the Scientific Journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, the author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirn Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was then the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his participants failed.
The researchers found that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were right with their answer and thus received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State lawyer from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been unreasonable for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan wars. Her office is located in the prosecution of the court of the former Yugoslavia, in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, since the chief officers of the Srebrenica Massacher - at the eight thousand Bosnian Muslim died - namely the Ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on a free foot.
Their names are on the list of director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a template for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, not yet running in Spain); a film that pursues the Swiss State lawyer from Belgrade to New York with the pace of a police terrorist to explore the uncommon criminals and put the respective governments under pressure so that they closer their networks.
What insurance is best suitable for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, whose height depends on different factors, including age, gender, date of drawing up the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First, one must be clear what we have to do with this.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the contracted insurance premium and is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of finding in a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance composed of several factors, including age, sex, date of drawing up the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments will be made in the event of a higher accident hazard.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women need to make less contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also after the company's conviction, are inferior to less accidents as those who are alone.
The benefit of the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thereby also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets its personal needs best.
We are now listing at this point the most important points that should be considered when selecting an insurance in order not only to take a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds, when selecting a price-benefit insurance, meet numerous obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full insurance insurance, there are still more valuable alternatives.
Careful drivers can select a full cashoe with self-participation, so that the benefits of a full-casco insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and using the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the sum to pay , explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, a intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the advanced insurance that insures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover steal, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs; then your credit is increased by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic tariff of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on society and their revenue.
If the company has a durable year behind, it can be allowed to increase bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year trade mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate is lower.
It is therefore the most useful to decide for a full insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been declined.
However, in a married customer who has no children, it is more advised to complete a full insurance insurance, of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
The insurers’ pages apply to couples with children than customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-participation (with a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you received a high credit, it is recommended that an extended insurance will be used until the third year of the vehicle.
They run more relaxed and have a larger purchasing force that allows them to make a higher contribution payment , says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is recommended to complete a self-participation insurance (with an amount of EUR 150) or to conclude an extended insurance which is only used in a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes at the point for the eight-finale in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting on Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague prerune. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while it decides about their participation at the shots.
The Italian team has already made five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a disagreement in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another with nine points to ensure that the FC Shakhtar does not collect the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth game round, as the FC Milland must enter the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time on the 13th in the semi-finale for the entrance to the final, which takes place on the 16th.
Thus this group will be completed in front of all others and the disagreement in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion to the expected result, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not speculate the Keltic Glasgow know that they would have a better starting position in the eighteen finals in the case of a victory grouper.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even rely on a trap of FC Shakhtar to qualify. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are able to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the mailanders will try to avoid the shots in the evening. They hope again to reach the eighteen final of the transformed championsleague for the second time after they were defeated in the preceding game season in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the after-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero disagreements on the playback.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eightefinale and its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European mastership, the Benfica Lisbon could reach the third place by a victory and thus participate in the UEFA.
20.000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave the views of 20,000 viewers of the start shoot for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Approximately the 20 000 people were able to experience the concert in the sale stage, showing a video about the history of the band that had provided for furre at the end of the ninety years.
The reunification and the world tour is crossed by the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hit and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden armbands on the stage, which had given them the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that led the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his widow Victoria had banned him in the past days.
During the preparations for the Show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British Star has not seen our garderobe a single time, so I'm already excited about what it will keep from the appearance.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 due to internal differences two years later the resolution of the group, expressed its nervosity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed that the feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And therefore I thought why not, so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself to the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also informed that the disputes were eliminated, and at the same time everyone was very pleased.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
For the first time, the group arrived in a special engine from the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the report by the television broadcaster CTV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from a army from child girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, in San José (on 4 December) and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
They will join the stage in Madrid on December 23th.
New fears of gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger of compromising Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The largest part of Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiew has warned that if Moscow increases the price that it needs to pay for the gas, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
A former conflict between the two countries last year reduced supply to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine needs to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the group agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from nearby Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said Ukraine's Minister for Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The change in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas events, but much of them remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the controls of the predecessory registers for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the control body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns about the lack of precise ideas of the number of foreign employees of the Scottish State Health Service.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of an attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a terrain car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transfer and was in charge of the mutatisfactory auto-bombing attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service carry out controls before the appointment of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre penalty registers, the Agency does not have the competence to receive this information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the main auditor's report suggests that the Board should adopt guidelines for the criminal register extract which will help employers to control in different countries.
"Even if we found evidence of these controls in some personal documents, they were not regularly carried out." the report stated.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation directives with a high degree before the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign healthcare professionals."
BMA Schottland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely", that studies in front of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the NHS Scotland's current pre-administration tests are working well and it is not clear which added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, most of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, even because the bodies have problems identifying those employees who are admitted to indefinitely.
The investigation continued to note that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were mostly complied with.
These include passport, working permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls before the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a concern for me to do this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that, in conjunction with the health authorities, the Scottish Government would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on checks prior to the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, are planned to publish them next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a Terror Complot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it took 208 militants for their belonging to cells, which had planned a prominent attack on an oil plant and on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporters said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathisans of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an alliance of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight soldiers, headed by a foreign national, planted an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35.000 man with a strong fast entrance to protect plants after a missed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the arrested persons belonged to a cell that was led by a "raket expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the military planned to smuggle eight projects into the Kingdom.
Other 22 of the prisoners had invented the report to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned the clergy to stop Saudi, who strives to engage in Iraq with Al Qaida Militaries, who want to fight the alliated forces and the U.S.-supported Shily Muslim Government, which is regarded as chaseric by the Hardliners under the Sunnian Saudi.
Al Qaida Milices consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in collaboration with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family dominating the government.
The Milits, accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target it to the prowestern Saudi Government, have looked at foreign residential areas, government buildings and plants of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last five months," a speaker of the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also covered a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising for the "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical sinus muslims that support violence against Muslims that are burned as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the miles.
The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place for life, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European space ship located on a circuit route show that the planet is even more similar to a reversed twin of the earth than has been conscious.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary paths, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Throughout billions of years ago, the conditions on the Venus would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable today, scientists believe.
But due to the unbraked carbon dioxide exhaustive effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sunlight and a slower rotation rate, the Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane-star winds and blitz storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space zone of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for one year, provide a reluctant view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said, "It is clear why the climate on the Venus is so different to that of the earth, while the planets are quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth, perhaps with a living environment."
"Reached uranium" captured by the police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reported by rich uranium, was captured by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was a rich uranium, but said that it could have been sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he does not hold it worth a presidential candidate to be asked by a snowman.
Yet, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared himself willing to make a debate on YouTube, in the normal voters to take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which ceases to vote next year.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN who supported the debate with which the candidates to show YouTube clips were selected.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was last dedicated to a single topic, immigration was at the heart.
The topic is one of the most vital topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecisive voters to serve a choice disk when they heard things that they liked: the television institute noticed the tops of consent when the candidates were strictly talking about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pre-resident, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation that he had been insufficient about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of setting illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly strangely questioned whether one of the candidates would support a "amnestie" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californic Congress member, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress member of Colorado, were able to draw attention to this issue.
No one of the two men has serious opportunities for nomination, but both remain in race, perhaps because they have stuck earlier and harder than others on the immigration paw.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views in general: tighter borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate has clearly been problematic than other issues have been addressed.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be torture.
One of the questionors asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-existing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was asked whether Jesus would advocate them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabees rising in Iowa, together with Ron Paul's recent donation results and his adjacent storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two are shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another grave to entrance; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandale, this is not particularly luxurious.
No eagle titles seem to be sold, no politician of Paris' hotel accounts paid, no exterior teeth were lured.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has swallowed donations to the British Government Labour Party over more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have come well without that of Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn from the demand for a choice, it was hoped that the British intelligence would be disappointed by claiming that question of opinion would not have influenced this decision, it was hoped that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly sharply representative of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the once feared Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr Bean.
The unsensitive salvation of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgment under the guard.
Badly thought-threatening proposals to change tax laws have put business associations against the government.
The tax-only loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unprecedented administrative puffs.
A trio of generals in retirement started a rebellion in the upper house of protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be minister of forces, so they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary (and her former Chairman of fulfillment) has already come back.
Nothing of this means that Brown breaks up irreversible direction.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to rule.
Neither can nor trust people politicians, but they usually keep their skepsis back when a new troop takes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not have to be involved for a long time, this suspension is over: the public service begins to become unsatisfactory; the cabinet ministers begin to preach; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will become defensive and objectiveless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot claim to be a new thing.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his chief lecturer.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax status documents, for example, are associated with decisions that Brown met as the Minister of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misbehavior - as with the long "Geld for Adels Title" examination of political parties financing - the voters may assume that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely crushed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is delivering what Brown's naturally stalinistic trends have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new gender for political donations is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his generous gifts, does not want to say public recognition for his welfare.
This may be the case, but the decision was not allowed to do so.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those governing the country.
What, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will, of course, have to ask himself some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, who was told about the strange donations in October.
However, Brown has not yet been involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination through the grassing of a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "the teachings to be taken from" are not very complex.
When the law was broken, it's one thing for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months, and to advance with a comprehensive reform of political parties financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pillars for a party companion like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion issues; he has two years to return voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through indispensable justice and solid competence.
Hair of Cards
Does the credit crisis affect the US credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that backflows are excited.
Now that America's real estate market is violating, the robbers have the country's credit card market in the shower.
Analytics of Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infringement of underfined loans spreads to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the bookings and in the seasonal rates that measure the proportion of loans that are not less than 30 days or less.
The HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer funding, partly due to the weakness of credit card operators.
It's still too early to panic.
Loss and sums are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarters season rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historic average.
The deterioration of the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims which, on the other hand, represent a large part of the losses of cedit cards; the number of applications (and thus saum fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for creditors are worsening or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates which show how much of its debt pays consumers every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stopping in other corners of the structured funding.
Dennis Moroney by the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output amounts for 2007 will be at last 25% higher than last year.
There is certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debt, now that home credits dry out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the flow of money rather than on capital values, therefore falling domestic prices do not necessarily solve a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage for the card publishers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the hypothesis rates fall if the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important among the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the worse conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and review the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Main Financial Referent.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable deviation are considerably more real.
If lower domestic prices and a reduction in the credits of America are pressed into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more cruel future.
Keep looking forward to these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be put before court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally incurred innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications to conspire with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 in order to achieve themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing before the court before the U.S. District judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the course of two-year delivery procedures in Britain.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally lodged against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the objective of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron downturn.
The accusation against the bankers - called the NatWest Three - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to eliminate a deceitful complot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless deceitful Enron-partnerships, who contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had a significant value.
A company under Kopers control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while fastow, copper and others sold about $12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of his role in Enron's Pleite in two accusations.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a 6-year prison in the Federal Prison of Louisiana.
Copper is a punishment of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million deposit, which made it necessary that they lived in the United States in the expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke down in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer diminish the billions of debt or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollar pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemnations for conspiracy, fraud and other points of charge were invalid after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a rolls-royce engine and enough reach to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a golf stream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand on the last Friday at the millionary exhibition, a four-day orgy from the viewed consumption, organized in a decorated exhibition centre at the city edge of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built out exhibition stands to hope that new Russians came to money were interested in everything, from Mahagoni-beaten yachts to diamond-transmitted autogrils, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer took care of a glossy orange porch at the next fair stand in the shower.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to flood with money like Dallas at its glowing times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialist," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overlaps of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most freely visible donors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury marks are looking for their share in the gold roast.
On the other hand in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high prices on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which is worth 670 billion dollars together, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert agency here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the Ministry of Existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelry.
She visited the fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all pleasantly cared and the men are all worth a realm."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients are millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs Yumatova, who delivered the design clothing that she had, like a red tape-veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to be targeted by the new, the type of marked-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the stable several hours to visit a new store house, which unpleasantly put Cadillac Escalades, pocket mesh from Platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, customized billiardtic, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybers alongside each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Giirath, who was patriotically sitting at a trade fair of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before a wall-wide imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbing climbers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years of age are already moving from large-speed logos to the kind of neat brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed in a commercial show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionary, messengers of millionaries or simply tourists, were pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten said here, he would have sold two $70,000 matratcensets, made of silk, casmir and cotton, with narrow gold feathers.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the grey orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that adjusts luxury cars to customers' wishes, said he had three car cooler grills for a rolls-royce fantom, which were similar to the cettenar movs, sold for $5,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car strip developed for a Russian casino owner with spices that he had taken over with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-payment.
"The Russian millionary, the radiant wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic circonium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30- or 40-week garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusiveity at present, in view of the increase in the real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionary, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a position operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which were filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 5000,000 false banknotes for the millionary trade fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the heads of money, mobile photos, while releasing themselves in the middle of the replacement wealth, to be cut by friends, or simply to insert a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Operation suspected at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and observed as a hospital at the white Cape Cod two doors on the bottom of the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the doctor's body viewer arrive," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew that someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the NewArcher Police Dezernat.
Now, the investigators try to find out whether she died for a procedure that was carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet detected what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and hopefully that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to explain a mysterious death that sent a sad man by the leadership of the Newark police.
Mrs Arroyo has been a assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known in the department.
"It was loyal, hard to work and hard," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
" She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer who was working for the alcohol control comission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11 and a step daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the state lawyer of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was explained to death in the place.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not informed about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say whether Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs Castros' house, where a glossed rosa smoke stands in the little front garden and calls a Dalmatin behind the house.
A blue fashion described with "ethyl vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilles in food and parfums - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the underground.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provinceal and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
" She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Central Bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in world share markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to rest the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthening comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The share markets increased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that policy must respond "flexible and pragmatic" to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down distressing markets, given signs of exciting credit voltages, Kohn said that the recent turbulencies had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further reinforcement of the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital splashes in the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped the Wall Street to calm down, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now as the sale of U.S. immobilies reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulencies have been stressed by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the US hygiene credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industry Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289,40 while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
The re-establishing of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined earlier after a strong demand for an increase in three-month guarantee funds of the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks had been granted to significantly 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to inject further funds into the money markets in London, increased when the loan voltages of the three-month "Libor" Councils for lending between UK banks were seen by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the Chairman of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help the Chief Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on this, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive Director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is no doubt.
It is never easy to strike precisely what allows a man to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that the business well knows, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless it is given him the possibility of swimming or undergoing.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities have this.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a hitter has to get regular chances in order if he wants to impress as a single-day cricket player.
To catch the eyes of the choosers is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself healthy and how the wind boils into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glance points and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium, only a question of view can be.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still fighting to fix himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he is underestimated a double hundred against Australia points, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah’s more experience on Boparas young enthusias at the Asgiriya stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger than 22 years old, and an excellent balance against rotated balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his homeärtarena as a player in Middle Sex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the electors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the turn from his struggle that was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-sounder from Essex has loose joy of life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket site and his attitude was brought to the point, when he had recently overturned a vehicle with four-rad drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick out his vodaphone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he boils his average speed with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit to him and hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be good if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad yesterday, with a stream of distributors whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had displaced from their houses.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damaskus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan, which had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitian doctor.
"I came back today, because of what I saw in the television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, with regard to the shooting milits of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his powers to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old British teacher from the largest sinusic part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian Visum and because the regime Iraqer is not allowed to work.
His scientists in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local military supported by the United States contributed to expulsion of Al-Qaida from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnitic and Shiitic tribe who had been displaced from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with handgranates after he had invited his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been locked by the increasing rest of the capital since the U.S. troops rise and the growth of local "groups affected" who were armed and defend their city districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and decorative funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqers had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Switzerland Minister, the Syrian Government had requested to impose visum restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectary squadrons of death in the country.
"We went well until Al-Maliki Syria visited and the government urged the Iraqians to no longer give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunnitic pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnites were displaced from Sithian residential areas and reversed, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will strike secular tensions again and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest country is leading in vocational training and even glances with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saarland puts the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained the 50th time of yesterday a non-sarland that we are not French" - this slogan pastes the smallest state self-ironically on his 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is in the educational monitoring of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW) at place five.
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students here can complete their study with a double or even three-fold diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the country children also bring the Saarland to an excessive average number of universities - many of them without a graduation at the gymnasiet.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plonnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his study rating at a vocational school, thus Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
Similarly, the combined opportunities for vocational and academic training are strongly expanded.
Measuring the population is the second-best in Germany with dual courses of study.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineer graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
"We have joined several reforms in the general educational schools after the first Pisa study," says a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparative tests.
To start learning the kids earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the benefits of the students are sustainablely improved, future comparative studies will only be shown.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk schools decreased from 29% to 20%.
However, Saarland as a whole did not increase as much as other federal countries.
The Bayern's better.
And as far as the Saarland is concerned, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise point.
For the language of the neighbors is required to be a college - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are closely different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the time meters in the South American country turn back about half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez deswegen wird zum Witzfigur.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law states that the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
So the South American State gets a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The U.S. fiendly Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had set up the classification in time zones for full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) for a hostage business the breakdown of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia.
The left nationalist said, as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not enter into relations to the Head of State or to the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who prepares a constitutional reform that the citizens of Allandes must vote on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would clearly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostels.
Uribe, with his decision to "spook his face," Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain is Chávez in all the mouths.
A new phone ringelton provides for Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why you don't think the mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
On the recent Ibero-American summit, Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who had been generous of the constant intervening calls of the left-popular and rided over the mouth.
Germanen threatens 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong economic growth, German workers are threatening a real wage loss this year.
Experts named a whole plenty of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could really calculate less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"Shall this be the modest development of wages, VAT increases and the price protection in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomic and Business Research of the "Image".
New burdens could also arise in unemployment insurance on workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the change in the year was right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Labour Agency does not have to be in vacant again to ask for loans or grants, the SPD policy has been quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products operated at the highest rate of inflation for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the holdish twin of the earth
The Venus is more similar than yet thought: The European space zone "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbulence to Poland, as they appear on earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it's blitzing on the Venus.
Now the European Sonde "Venus Express" has demonstrated - she felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The blitz on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the Scientific Magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" Blits have caused life on earth to arise: Thoughts in the ocean should have encouraged reactions leading to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there has ever been life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything vibrant on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times deeper than on the earth, it sometimes dominates temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil willing of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has encountered such a different development, is the basic issue of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since the beginning of the ninety years no sonde was on the way to explore this planet.
The latest research results now presented in several "Nature" articles are not only subject to the uniqueity of the Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonities of our neighbouring planet with the earth are larger than first accepted," Esa notes.
Thus, the researchers, besides the already known wind of the North Pole, also found a cloud belt on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team about Giuseppe Piccioni by the Italian stifto di Astrophisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet, also called morning or evening star, creaks in nearly 225 days around the sun.
But he turns much slower about himself: a Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have developed under very similar conditions.
On both, water that remained on earth in oceans was collected in Venus but lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it is the most part of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Kühler defends Merkel meetings with the Dalai Lama
President Köhler demands a end of the party dispute about the receipt of the Dalai Lama at the office of office.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the office after the meeting in September.
President Horst Köhler is concerned with the appearance of Germany and asked the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the external world in this question a split nation," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Federal Cancer Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even though I have respect for the difference in cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but Merkel took protection from the prosecution, they operate a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken a distance from the traditional one-China policy.
That's what China knows," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had demonstrated indirect discouragement over the receipt of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from series of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "Schu-Window Policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas at the office of office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister for Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of both foreign ministers.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now called on Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel to submit the reception of Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians in official function receive the religious leadership of the Tibets, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The deeds and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other modern provinces, from China.
Scheuble warns against crowns like in France
Road battle with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schueble warns against crowns like in France.
It has to be done everything so that social dissatisfaction in Germany is not released into violence on the road, the Federal Minister called for.
Barrikaden burned, Randaliers shot on the police with scratch flints: After the severe youth crucibles in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful that we do not also build up social explosives and release into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Counsel, countries and municipalities have already worked with the emphasis on reducing problems, said Schuble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first success already shows."
However, it is too early for warning.
At the same time Schuble pointed out that in German forests there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In northern fronts of Paris, young people in the past nights had delivered heavy road slaughters with the police.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Indeed, greater integration efforts from the Federal Government demanded the chairman of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the crown in France, Colat warned against "compassing effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with migration background under 25 years of age was "over average".
In particular, more training spaces must be provided.
Colat stressed: "We have to give youths a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish community added, in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
In addition, many youths with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Colat urged, "But we have to be careful."
You must give youths the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.
In the meantime it remained quiet in the night in the Pariser Vorort Villiers-le-Bel.
Centuries of the police were in use, a helicopter overlaped the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning waste warehouses and cars.
Since the previous day, some 1000 security forces have been offered to rest.
The police will go through as long as it is necessary, interior minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the pre-town city.
In the evening on Tuesday, cranewalls in Villiers-le-Bel had been injured about 80 police officers.
In the follow-up, the disruptions on Toulouse were overcome.
The crwalls were inflammated on a traffic accident where two young ones died on Sunday.
The police do not blame for the death of young people after the first knowledge of the lawyer.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The actual appearance of the bargain documents that the coalition is in content at the end - and that it is no longer expected by herself.
In what country does this Bundeskanzler actually live in?
After their unfortunate appearance in the Federal Day General Debate, which was worsening and content arm, it must be said: not here - not in the country that would eventually be governed by it.
The claim that it was focused too much on foreign policy has rejected Angela Merkel with an incredible sentence.
That's provinceal, she said, and she only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Federal Day, it has documented how much of its objection is applicable to everyone.
There was no specific interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela’s cloud presented itself: a rehearsed politician who flees to foreign policy and even remains in danger.
For example, climate protection: as it praises unremembered for the decisions of Holy Dammem, it does not say how to achieve the climate targets to this country.
In fact, the self-promise - so much discouragement would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she climbs to the flesh that the rise comes to the people.
So she damages her image as a practitioner who solves the problems instead of speaking nicely to the world.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, internal policy problems are a peripheral appearance.
Children's poverty and the worries of the lowly deserves?
There's a few bits left for it.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the child’s surplus.
Three runs need Merkel there to bring out a half-way straight sentence.
She prides as on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attacke department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide a hard exchange - and now have to fear a foreign candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already disappeared in the first topic.
He made New York to a "afuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney forecasts his contradictor Rudy Giuliani.
This comments on his part with heavy claims: "I would say that his own house was a port for Illegale," replies Giuliani and suggests the former governor of Massachusetts to have occupied private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blast to attack: Since the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential prosecutors use the debate on CNN especially to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30 second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have made Hitler come to power," John McCain suggests his contradictor Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read the Levites from Vietnam-Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a interrogation method that simulates drinks as torture.
However, that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the Saal Public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium offers an appreciation.
This shows once more where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney crushed and devoted to the base and television public that he was still one of the adolescents in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the slinger when he is considered to be asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilians
One day after his resignation as armed chief, the Pakistanian powerholder Musharraf has been deprived as President.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was defeated on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistan TV transferred the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had sent his office as armed chief to his familiar Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his power gained in an unblooded military booth, the former general is now the first ruler of civil government.
With his resignation as chief commander of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of opposition and west.
Another central demand is the end of the exceptional state that Musharraf had attached on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will, according to the State Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, cancel the exception and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the Country, which Musharraf had occupied with his weighing jurists, had rejected all contradictions against the controversial reconciliation of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
At the time of an attack on a military convoy, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured in the northern region of the tribe of North Waziristan.
According to a army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Sevenths remnant: The three band members of Harmonia reacted to a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a cut from their great time "Life 1974" appears.
They were far more famous in abroad at that time.
The recommended sensation then occurs in the shape of three men set at the evening table.
Everyone has his box before himself, his cable and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the bloody white hemd with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrated on the console.
Everyone helps sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it adds accidentally to a traditional piece of music.
That does not seem to disturb the Gentlemen themselves.
The removing of the band Harmonia has ensured some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted demands showed that although the name sworn through collective pop memory, it was not so sustainable for 32 years to miss this band painfully.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the 1960s?
Especially what misleading Krautrock means, in England and America was always more true than in its own country.
When the music economy gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifework, you saw in the hall in questioning German pop-viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked themselves in the Laudatio at the La Düsseldorf bands and New!, the surprise did not know any limits.
In concerts, Michael Rother later hocked at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignored home and the V declaration in the stranger is one.
This is why the memory has already been exaggerated with Harmonia, because the Trio existed only two years and at this time also developed a much lower power than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously museized with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, it was played in the basement under the Berlin scene.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label that is entertained by the church.
Rother had helped out shortly at power plants and then as a guitarist at New!, who then might be the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians to the Exil to Forst in the Westbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still able to plague as a child girl.
It's just in a crushy artist's atmosphere.
It is said that in the locker waste was also a thrust of the Harmonia Ottenstein Song Association and a name for the art.
Some of them held Harmony of it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so left and modestly the music also sounded, the band suffered material need.
The collection of rice did not serve solely in self-detecting.
The now published CD "Life 1974" was cut with a concert in Gressem, before a nearly 50-headed record ball, as someone believes to distinguish.
From Rother then the desire to force harmonia and sometimes exercise.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral claim.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Redher landed in Esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming hearts".
Cluster has been resurrected in the eighths and has been more successful since then than Harmony ever was.
The Grasser Live Album is to be thanked for Herbert Grönemeyer.
This Platform Company of Greenland has been aimed at maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures in the world.
Publicly subsidised, under the festival of Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
What would be the whole bandwidth of the impact of the Krautrocks on the following pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno sweats with the most special sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farmer's studio.
The legend formation serves projections of further black and white photos of our wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are reconsidered with the improvisation.
No more by climbing microphones to the organ and to the laptop to unlock the instruments via self-covered power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically depth tuftler.
It does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morning Star, sound clouds are hoisted and devoted and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music high schools (can), technologies (powerwork) or on the escape of artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "68" does not have absolutely wrong, and harmonia can't get out of it now.
The most self-conscious one is carefully considered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or refugee moments of great luck.
Richard Gere isn't cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderal Peace" two films are dealing with the Balkan war again.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts set too much on action and balls or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark behindland of the Bosnia war, has now been recovered by the actress Richard Gere.
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the eighty years because too many net-important roles in well-feel films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism exaggerated the desire to see.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to see himself "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes hunting" (Why does movie titles have to be as long today and we may be like lectures?) maybe.
He delivers a marvelous eyebrowing representation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made of Gere if the fate and the film industry would not be so gracious: a man who has his best time behind himself, but who has preserved even as a ruin-like monument of his decline, even considerable remains of the intricate charm.
However, despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production of "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Mörderal Peace" you can make a short process: The film is made by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from cosovaric shields, and one of them is promptly in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the servants are not once represented as the sole root of all evils here, the remote film loses too quickly in balls and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored for example why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The history of three U.S. war reporters that open up to discover the Serbian superwar criminal "the fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another turnbook author (both in the Staff Union Richard Shepard).
Because the Storys are like a questionable one: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can't, and both times it's going to be a trip into the crazy mind.
One of the reasons for failure to "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply to let down to be the downtown cynics with heart when he is presented at the beginning.
No, the script has to inspire him another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" then falls down the bach, when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time retrieval procedure have succeeded in what Nato, CIA and all the world's head money hunters have not managed in five years: the war criminals catch and leave the Muslim Bosnia to the righteous revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in the Hague for crime against the Kinologic.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wants to prompt that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspects the Americans and the Frenchs (these should be exceptionally agreed) not to pursue too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But that good commonness and evil are sometimes similar to one of the famous Brecht poems.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "I feel compassionately see the swollen thorns, inspiring: how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have precisely such scalp heads, but they argue how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper has reported that all Iraq films of Hollywood were large fleps.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always apply: When a star runs around on the crises or mine fields of the world, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "beside all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprico.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close at time.
It had to go decades before Hollywood could turn a good movie on the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still be mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated as master works at the same time.
But perhaps we know today where every mass murder in real time comes home on equally two screens, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the writers the inconvenience that it needs to tell good stories.
"Sin or nonsense" or "The Great Diktator" has finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarkastically distant artist view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan war, he answered, "It is only because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terrible dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel manner and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
Critics for Olympia Absage harvested by Beast
The departure of the Mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has led to severe criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
But of the beast, realism encourages the assessment of the opportunities.
On Wednesday, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Trade, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a refusal as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently evolved as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaide.
"It would not be possible to maintain the same level without this objective."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to end the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a changed timeline".
Citizen Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in earlier statements that the Olympics of Hamburg were at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic Application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said by Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the early December decision of the Sports Federation on an application of Munich for winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period we have so far thought up to 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream is not wiped out for all time, said of beast.
The Hamburg Sportsbund (HSB) regreted the statements of Beusts.
This raises the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build up a chance by preserving the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
In addition, a refusal to apply is in opposition to the statement of the Senate Head of Reception for the Full Assembly of the General German High School Sports Association.
There, by Beust, the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only been nominated in the last week of Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD citizenship fraction proposed the Senate not to have used valuable time for the housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has set on the map Olympia and has climbed the housing building," said the SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the small grassbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later housing use, the CDU has set one side to the "Event factor".
The application for the Olympic Summer Games in 2012 had resulted in a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the same time.
However, Hamburg failed to Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's boxes.
He who connects the terms of Sweden and wood chest thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
You don't?
Currently, in Sweden fabrised wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's workshop.
Most of the four and ninety listed Brillo boxes from "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expresses" doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes in 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an awesome result: the six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the some hundred other Brillo boxes from "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The past history is decorated, a confusing procurement of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo box", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's consciousness - made hundreds of Brillo boxes from paperboard: These were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonagen factory.
It was not artworks, but their examples, only exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted the permission to produce a few Brillo-holz kists in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museum in 1968.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that then have just entered into the art and auction history as an authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo box with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968 and was exposed to then Warhol left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg until 1990.
Warhol had been dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museum, has also examined three of the museum owners of Brillo-Boxes from Swedish private ownership, of which two were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm: your press span plates were first founded and swallowed, afterwards white oil was placed with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 suggests that the colour was directed on the press span plate with a painting role without foundation - it is not oil- but acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, admits: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced the "severe charges" that are being raised in matters of soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been an unreasonable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up

Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.

The rebellion failed after nearly 24 hours of refusal to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts against democratically elected governments on the Philippines.
