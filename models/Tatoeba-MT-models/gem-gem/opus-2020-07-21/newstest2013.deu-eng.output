A Republican strategy to counteract the re-elective of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the last to be a myth by confirming that the electoral fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the lightning.
In 10 years, the Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments have announced new laws since 2009 which harm the procedure for registration or urgency.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 countries.
Consequently, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of election law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the electoral to present a lighting certificate and evidence of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for preliminary voting, the right of invalidity to register as a voter on the day of the election, and nationals have voted on the right of choice for which a judicial act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State has requested the voters to present a lighting certificate.
Indiana was the first state that raised such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law.
The Republican authorities hasted to extend this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they promoted draft laws in 34 states, with which the electors are forced to present a light-sharing certificate.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million electoral persons do not have any credit card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, in 2012, five million new selectors do not have such a certificate.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to obtain the necessary licence.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people unreasonably strongly.
Indeed, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary lighting evidence.
This is still enough.
The students who are considered to be electoral, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several countries to use their lighting certificate issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same countries allow members of angel or hunting associations to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state has requested a proof of citizenship to choose.
Arizona was the first state that introduced such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen countries have adopted laws that demand by the voters that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of three hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of voters was dismissed on the day of election.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide those voters with assistance that want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for chooser registration at the general elections in 2004 have contributed to registration about 10 million nationals.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the 2010 registration of new selectors compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aiming at reducing the period for preliminary voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who chose in advance were Afro Americans, although they were only 13% of the elections in the state.
The same applies to the hispanic population.
Lastly, only 11% of the voters represented, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, were only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their adherents have entailed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of the voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has taken action to suspend the most violent laws.
They could partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 state states have adopted laws that require the presentation of a lighting statement.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right of choice.
The democratic critics explore the partial political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries explicitly for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the countries who have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes that are required in the electoral body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer prior identification: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes malfunctioning results, with false negative or but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay in the undetermined men for the implementation of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there were many interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a post-observation after 12 years the probability of producing metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 when you have a direct relative who was already sick of prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been recognized.
There are cancer species that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be made real understandable to the extent of the risk of its cancer disease by showing the potential options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in a long term, and in these cases it is rather decided to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer do not take treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and will be treated when the disease is progressed.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who should not be addressed are definitely more precise.
That is why I recommend the implementation of the test.
However, it is important to talk to his doctor to determine whether to do it or not.
In collaboration with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed a tool that enables it to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer may be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, speakers of the Canadian cancer society.
However, approximately 10% of cancer is expected to be caused by inheritance.
More people also remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependency remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It harms the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, grim-tarm, mastdarm, food ears, stomach roasting and breast-feeding cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against Grimmar cancer," he adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of illness of a Grimm or Mast Darm cancer.
Wurst products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smokers, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Latests can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, your investigations are currently unclear.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are opposed.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-existence.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has inclined a certain view in the last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is the last particles whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" declaration of nature and the behaviour of the matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physics it is not fully sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week at a large physics convention in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be fully sure about it.
Yet, let's assume that it is actually the Higgs, because it seems that there is only a small risk of faking, and let's look at what it is.
There is a necessarily indispensable law in this world that causes two objects not to be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong, as you will hurt.
For even if particulate physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "Quantent State", with this "state" in general consisting of some of their properties.
From this, the physics divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, the good citizens, which are called Fermione, are closely obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, a bad band of anarchists, who are nothing sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same place.
These Bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is still absolutely amazing): the mesons we will not treat here and the "power particles", by which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Higgs-Boson would be somewhat related.
It has to be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you could mean.
If you are able to read this history, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic power.
For if a particle accelerates with an electric load or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "trusted" just at this place, such as a choel stone that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates a electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but one photon and thus one of the bosons "trayers of power".
Stabiler Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "trusted" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the agent must reach very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen dust, whose surface could only be scared by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle acceleration like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - is needed to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet paper would never hold itself at the refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
What can all these research now be "good," asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physics to examine all the differences between the observations and the SM predictions.
There are also many physics who hope that such variations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
You must say that last ones still have great deficiencies, as it does not provide any explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which represents about 80% of the material of the universe (new ups!).
However, such variations were not found at CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no present.
Moreover, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Labors have not suspected that their works would cause such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications but nothing else.
Indeed, the dead physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first long-term laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - already said that the laser was considered rather a "Labor play" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be based on all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optic.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "Auge" and has introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on 'Death in dignity', Quebec has recently discussed the tough question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft legislation is prepared.
However, much remains to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that raised him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the past.
"Allerdings it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating itself.
At the table sitting before a delicious lunch, willingly he resigns in to be helped with dinner.
Courageously he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medicines to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of usual death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhoea because this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is pinking," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the ability of the person," taking a backward, he establishes.
For, according to a number of people working in the Palliative Care, major events are taking place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are invoked in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them will no longer overcome them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by disturbance".
But by the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that one sets her a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
The home of Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers' body care and help at the food intake.
The Palliative Care will then be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11 700 inhabitants come to bed for the Palliative Care.
That's very little if you take into account that we'll all die one day.
Here, life will continue under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It is granted to the dieder, depending on the request, a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Today morning his son will drink the beer to the feet of the dead.
"We help families and patients in the same way," reports Nurse Director Nathalie Savard.
The home of Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
Besides an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his headsets while admitting to his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies in tragic ways after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel angry.
53% of the patients in Victor-Gadbois' home are from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians have no access to the Palliative Care, i.e. to a care that should ease the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the end stage of their life, both at home, at the hospital or in a hospital.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the community for home Palliative Care in the large Montreal area, specialize themselves more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great insufficientness in the health care of Quebec ensures that several specialised doctors in the Palliative Care are looking forward to the adoption of a law governing death aid and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifest has been signed by prominent individuals of the Palliativpflege, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to demonstrate their opposition to such a initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec Health System is not effective enough to ensure that all rights to a high-quality palliative care have before accepting to pass to death aid.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency recording without taking measures to reduce her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several uncologens treat their patients despite the worst forecasts until the last day.
The survival possibilities of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a complaint of chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I'm going to stop the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the career that it has not done this wish after their pain has been reliefed by a team of Palliative Care.
However, it must be clearly stated that the palliative care is not excessive in pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of the Home Palliative Care of the Great Montreal, 8% of the patients do not address pain treatment.
Thus, all at the end of life, doctors frequently react to the terminal seed, which is exciting to sleep the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can't do that anymore as if we do not observe this side of suffering.
Patients with no pain relief will be more and more frequently able to withdraw from this terminal seed.
Patients whose pain is not relief, all say the same sentence, "I will die."
But that means not necessarily, "I want you to sleep in," but "I want my pain to be relief."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals large sizes in Quebec
Office officials, construction companies, financial agents of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell them every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction economy, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are crashed.
A "Industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and the 2000s.
"It's strange how the system breaks since you've taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchessneau, Leader of Quebec and former leader of the Montreal police.
The scandal was detected by him due to an in-depth examination of the contaminations related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which then the Prime Minister had only absent.
The "Duchessneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and the coupling of officials.
"At the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport alone had spared a billion dollars to the contracts," because some were pushing their instinct to receive their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "had already brought two civil championships to the fall," adds, in the hope that she will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 permanent anti-corruption unit also undertakes great efforts with its troops of economic auditors, researchers and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Trap", which since 2009 has resulted in the "Calaisation Card" of Montreal in the artificial breakdown of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house reviews and charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcote, the mayor of a city.
The next item would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just come back from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly received smuggling money in the exchange of public contracts.
Other engineers were explicitly accused of the road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has encouraged oversight by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in all the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) to province parties, especially to the liberals that were at the time.
He also said that he had organised an illegal acquisition for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelisation contracts whose costs were artificially blurred by him
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and eishockey games, as well as coupling money of 736.000 dollars as a remuneration for channeling contracts whose costs he artificially blew up.
Other officials of the road construction office have confessed that they have been swallowed by blowing up the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Citizen's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately seeing a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these explorations, Mr Tremblay came back in early November, which brought Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who took a warning.
As a burial champion of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she rejected from 2010 against the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million to buildings in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is finally carried out, she says that she's pulling "to a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system undergoing by maize to stop the evil and to climb the guilty."
She says that the procedure is " painful, but positive."
However, we are about to clean up the wound, we need an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchessneau notes on his part that "Agents stole several hundred million dollars," but especially thinks about the role of the "manship carriers who are in the image of the tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a proportion of 70% of black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he whispers: "I was told that this was only a weak cluster of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which would not change anything to the situation: "As long as the elections are not strictly restricted, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the funding of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by giving courage to the things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international appearance of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchessneau calls on those who laugh about throwing a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
During this season, you have adopted a new degree with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff have also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of game.
And in a game, this is even easier.
Everything goes very fast in the football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of preparing training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress progress gradually.
They are therefore taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to carry out games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is essential.
This leads to a player like me who needs to offer the head and want to give his best.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti introduces respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the League 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more tracks in Paris.
In January, I had a courageous conversation with him.
At that time, I just recovered from a injury series.
The confidence he put in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the League 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're lying in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the eight-final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak with our words against very good European teams.
First, we want to become the first of our group before Porto so that we can carry out the replay of the eightefinale as a home game.
Can the PSG in a short way become a large European association?
He's already got the budget for this...
To become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the funds for the adoption of concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the League 1, as this was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really heartfelt to reject this title.
During the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry out the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even though the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring the title, I think we have the thing to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us is expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can imagine, this is certainly frustrating.
You're wondering what the people are expecting.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eight-final since two seasons, and who has also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points of advance!
This meant that our opponents and the French mastership would be abandoned.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boasted by this new PSG".
This shows that the liquor is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling victory in May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the benefits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To be so better that you're talking about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of the League 1.
Everywhere where he played, he thought he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM in 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from putting out some time.
I've seen things that I've been reinforced from there.
Today I manage to perform good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teachings, and today we have to show an example of behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The National Trainer is strict, stands close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does the inquiry made in Spain on 16 October (1:1) represent an intake game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payments and sales are possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, there is a political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchanges such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers on the network, about 200.000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a payment fund.
After reaching a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, the Bitcoin course fell to $2 five months later before he recovered to $10 today (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that can be won or purchased (and sometimes switch back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time keepers of the account, auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually taking place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
This means that the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
By means of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the accounts of public accounts widely distributed across the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This happens through a mathematical task that will be started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, who has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a piece of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file to a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add them a number before the whole is "cracked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any change would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice fast (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided to a hundred million pieces, which leaves a certain game space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The used weakness point does not concern the actual protocol," insurses Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money washing using this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals this deficiencies.
Important players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analysed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a Mega lock sale was launched.
"Third thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper thereby.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with the dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify one address that can be "fotografed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to consider hierarchical systems more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin gets through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he forecasts.
In its report, the ECB also proposes to re-evaluate the different risks considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We've been withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to recognise the ownership of their territory and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have in particular punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have escaped to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, such as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries and archaetic traditions, even though they have joined Djihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbeken and Tajikes.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local resistors, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the foundation in Nijrab, which I saw by a hill planted with mandel trees financed by French loans, was properly done.
The truck and pancer convois surrounded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no inflows of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their inconsistent march from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the land was transferred from war due to the struggles of the various oppressive groups.
Their power acquisition was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obsurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until now.
Former Mudschahedin, the Afghan Government and the present Taliban have the common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Sowjetic war have returned to power in 2001.
They have transformed into business makers by capturing lands of the government to sell them as a farming country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American award of sub-contracts.
They brought themselves in prosecution, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have been able to make use of the American appropriations: capital aviation is considerable.
The young people have seized the war and its ideologists.
During their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is below 25 years; now Kabul has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the instant parties or to corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are owned by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There's a army now.
Will the authorities under which they are commanded be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Sowjetic battle are already trying to restore the milits in the province, which will be removed from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identity should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the Bureau of the Prime Minister, which was since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidency force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in the event of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign assistance since the 1950s and long before.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional dust plants are not present and important watering systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, State control of infrastructures would have been required.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses huge soil treasures.
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to authorise it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper on the site, or without means of transport for exporting over the mountains, there is no mining possible.
The Chinese have already left the copper mines of Mes Aynak nearly, the international archaeologists (funded by the world bank) in the huge Buddhist place make their excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, reproduce normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French battle forces was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Agreement provides for the continuing of traditional assistance: girl and younggymnasia, Institute of French at the Universitys, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural field, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out in thousands of mountain doors numerous non-profit work and measures for the renewal of agriculture and have been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These work, for which many local workers were required, have helped to undermine the resurrection: watering, fountain, drinking water, re-evaluation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural uses.
What souvenir do we leave after two billion euro military expenditure?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
Thousands of written requests for small agricultural projects have been received in the message by municipalities of the Capisa Province.
In order to liberate farmers from the rebellion conducted by foreign groups, which is their desire according to their own statements, the reconciliation would be smaller, well-controlled and directly related to civil assistance for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise all of them, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly will adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a provisional, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal interference.
This new initiative has only ensured an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "break his word" and "the right to go with feet".
On the sides of his advocates, it is a way to stop the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to avoid their efforts to explain the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to recognise its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is inclined throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the U.S. week view Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, with this withdrawal of an excessive vote, the Egyptian people are put to an Ultimatum: "Besides, you are voting for my draft or I reserve the unlimited full power," the latter should consider to end after the constitution has been adopted.
85 largely Islamist members of this Constitutional Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals have not met the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they rejected because they believe that they have not been able to apply their viewpoints.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
For the achievement of the decision-making capability, 11 persons, representatives, were added last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it entertainable that the only difference in opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, since some members of the body were of the opinion that the pedestrian of the constitutional congregation did not go accurately.
The text, which was still adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which was all focused on itself, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Scharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, were hoping to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more stringently.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a proof of their good will and of their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Shealth" responds to the liberals who only view this as a propaganda struggle.
Because they say that the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out on other articles.
In particular, in the eye of Article 220, which admits an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Scharia.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The first signs of a theocracy can be seen here."
The fears of the liberals are also devoted to the fact that the next director of this university is much less moderate than the current.
"There is no specific religious commitment at this time.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the citizens' state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system," Alexis Blueet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
He admits, however, that in relation to Article 220 there can be a multi-decision as the terms used are rejected to the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islavian jurisdiction, note d. Red.]
And in the future, the question could be raised in what extent civil judges are competent to decide about it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised due to the extensive powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the defence budget will not be reviewed to Parliament, but to a national defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have requested to defend human rights.
Lastly, they also share their fears regarding the text they consider as a threat to freedom.
The proof of blasphemy will be maintained, and contemptions are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The prosecutors of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the nail of the world and a sea from Sole
The anointed country unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unreasoned nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Beneath the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It says that everyone who bathed in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place in which Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the silence of the seastorm and the fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most saints are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful ones are going here on the path of passion or crossway of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman Festival of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on the Mount Golgotha, where the crossing place, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
It is here, according to the Christian view, of the world’s navel, which symbolizes the rescue of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew from the tree from which the Cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the clergymen, the remnant of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different beliefs leave records with desires that then come into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Massada Festival form the remains of the secret hide from enemies that Herod the Great made build for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountain climbs can reach the ruins with their own power.
All others bring an air sailing path to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, in 1600 to 2040 metres, the famous ski area of Hermon is located in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ships have a total length of 45 kilometers.
An ancient legend suggests that pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting ones should be visited.
Here is one of the Israel Museums near the Knesset (Parlament).
There old Qumran manuscripts or writings are stored by the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exponents.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several sails of ancient Turkish bathrooms with sculptures from then visitors and bathrooms.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenirs.
The entrance is free and donations are basically rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shaking chapters of history.
The most striking department is the monument for the children who have been built for the memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is full darkness.
Stars kick.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died come to pass.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main restraints of Israel are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinarias and oceanarias.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air is warmed up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathed throughout the year.
On the other hand, this unusual sea with a position of 417 metres below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turkis blue water has a high salt content and thus wears even non-sweaters easy on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is infinitely beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt oil) and salt slamm as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergy, asthma, extracts, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease, and for calming straped nerves.
touch the secrets of ancient times
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa at the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to be slinging through the close gases named after star signs.
Fortuna shall be the legend according to all holds that touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly dealt with couples from all Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strive through the Roman theatre and conquer the crustaceans.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre today, evening concerts and operas are listed.
List of tourists
If you drive to Israel, do not worry about your bad English knowledge: About 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is to be taken into no euros, but to dollars that can easily be switched into shekel (current exchange rate: $1 to $3.8 shekel).
In the city you are usually coming forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line in the country with six stations that connect the suburban to the capital.
It's just a underground standway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, which is sufficient for a journey of up to 1.5 hours, regardless of the transport means.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is held in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and businesses are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only coke food is served, which excludes pig meat, marine products, fish without scraps and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with Hammel and Rind meat, soups and deserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish Humus palace, various socks, fried balls of fermented beans and herbs (fala) as well as fruit and vegetables.
There are no thrilling dogs in the streets of Israel.
For this, there are many well-food cats that are cozy and unhealingly spreading through the streets.
In the evening, you see them even sleeping on the roof parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to delicious eggs.
Car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs additionally $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Income cards for museums cost in the cut 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventures and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 Thousands of Ukrainian tourists arrived in the yellow country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% in 2010, before lifting the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens' lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with false certificates
Annually 13 million guests come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families staying in the home.
On 1 December, a law which, according to each migrant, has to carry out a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language was in force.
Until now, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests at the time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are to be required for all guest workers in the future.
There is not only a need for language tests, but also for testing in Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the maintenance and the extension of the working permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens from countries where Russian official language is.
In addition, those who received their training certificates and diplomas before the destruction of the USSR in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Sensation, problematic and protection of rights
The whole of the auditing bodies will be under the honour of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can carry out the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the Members of the Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
In contrast, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' laws asked several times: What does the whole actually bring?
What changes do the regulation bring to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
Especially, speakers of the Migration Authority respond to the reduction of the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrants," says the leader of the Federal Migration Authority in Tadschikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only an organised recruitment will solve 90% of foreign workers' problems.
Problems arise from migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical review.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intents, which will put him under the predecession of help into a dark, close barack, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, you will be promised one, and at the arrival you will be betrayed, your passport will be taken away and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the leader of the main management for the migrant work, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't swallow, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia do not only allow them to control the language of the country of destination, but also to express themselves in their own language hardly in writing.
Of course, this is not as much their fault as rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Ubeken and Tadishes can provide only a reasonable basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, but swear to buy them good clothes, shoes and schools.
As a teenager, then these children take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspects of the law.
The test must only leave immigrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
However, most of the host workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome Welcome" or "Unauthorised Access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain a official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faking and we are not registered, and then there are cases of stress.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamow says to journalists.
"Don't scourge any costs for false papers"
Already on the day on which the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates, which certificate the graduation of the language test, have already been charged by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a regular colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a work migrant three thousand rubles.
That the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens' lawyers agree.
At the moment, the authorities can only promise guests who fall through the test at the first time that they receive time for a language basic course.
In addition, new visitors without language skills are offered offices in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the recent events: injured in shooters on weddings and seven dead in the arrival of the Moscow Jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the wear of non-mortal weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of shot weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and promised the chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments to the Arms Act should be presented in short of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
In the Internet, an open letter was published, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - require the authorities to take a distance from "sinless worsening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal, Wasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Interior Ministry's statistics, 142 crimes were committed with the application of registered weapons in 2012 during six months, while a total of 1,168 thousand delicates were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a reinforcement of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from operating on the black market.
Currently, the authors in Moscow are able to find any possible weapon for little money.
While the Ministry of Interior stresses that the dissemination of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come over several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was working ten years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by the staff of the criminal persecution authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms.
In many military camps there were frequently explosions.
"There are evidence that there were some cases of fire foundation to violate the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market will also provide the arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private armoring plants that do not stand the international competition and therefore swallow the weapons under hand on the black market, such as in Moscow,," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kirgizia.
"There is a own, sometimes crafting production and a mafia organizing the jewelry," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The main part of the illegal weapons comes from the army and the legal authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were there by the "guilt of responsible people who have come to do with weapons in their work", says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% fall to thefts in arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor of a gun shop, which does not want to be called namely, assured that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been buying no more since they are older.
According to him, it is more frequently that dealers get the post in a arms camp.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased over a fence.
The gun is exposed and handed over by the tooth.
"The dealer brings the weapon into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime, regular control purchases by dealers offering illegal weapons," the seller adds.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find the most frequently known about each other.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone became aware of me and proposed to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to break me to some place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a familiar who has contacts," says the sales adviser. "I have such a familiar, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you need to go and use a code like "from Iwan Ivanowitsch, who lets the daughter lose a tooth."
I'm even coming to some blows right now about a familiar person I trust.
He's also delivering me the shots because he knows I'm not hiding him.
Newling are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was represented.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranez, does not get the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but riding with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disk.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakts", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are required or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Kopen Campshotgun or Guilt".
There users give up your orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors too?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Iwan" (such as a literal quote).
"Kopen a TT. Moscow," is the Lacony question by "Fedorkow".
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless skin sites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and may make coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I heard from the following schedule: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The officers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a banking machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that if you place a request on a website, you can also go out and get behind grids.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless skin sites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Sibirian labour camp and may make coal," he says.
A Macarow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal shooting weapons, it is estimated to be at prices from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarow for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is released in military arms camps by overseers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of defects with illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22,9 thousand, while the number of cases of stealing and pressure related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket employees struggle
Each fourth American youth sits behind the box of Mc Donald's
In the past days there were massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
No one can foretell whether the protest will continue to swell or whether they will soon get out of the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several links-oriented non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food employees, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this sector of the economy is hardly socially organised.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, in which sales took place in the USA, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand joints.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, put their work down and covered together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group of persons is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windels over hunting guns and autobatterias to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is in average between 8 and 27% more favourable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and varieties made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
Last complaints also about severe working conditions, such as missing gabel bars or hand scanners.
The participants of the protest at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the operating health insurance had increased from 30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9,5 dollars the hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
These are about 1.1% more than they spend for wages now.
If Walmart completely converted the salary increases to the customers, every purchase cost them only 46 cents more in future.
This would be for them every year compared to today's additional expenditure of only $12.39.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to see that only in nine states there were protests and they did not make any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took on Thursday to midnight in his store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to Thursday, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-righted Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees were the work and the protest action was only "a further PR-trick" of the union that the protests organized.
"Free Cass!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart films (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore inexisting so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage in accordance with the federal and New York legislation is at $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants the minimum wage will be raised occasionally, but not too strong, and averagely their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it's possible to get out of the money in New York, I'm unrecognizable.
There was once a time in which almost a quarter of all American youths after school at McDonald's, but the young ones still lived with their parents.
Nearly one saw the main source of income or planted to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with employees of McDonald's constant people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to get children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests that started on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and kitchens of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars, which corresponds to more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US-American law prohibits the management of the company to stand in the way of this goal and to reject or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unfried
Lautstar protests were there this day also before many other fast-food restorants in Manhattan.
The peak of the protest was a assembly in lunch before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrations were also supported by other prominent New York Democracies, for example, Mayer Citizen Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of their kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, from which not all are busy in the fast-food industry, working in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet possible to determine whether the radio of this protest will mobilize all the masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overlisted"
The popular theme of enlarged reality in modern technologies is considered in recent times for normally through the lens of a special brilliant.
First, in summer, Google presented a working model at his annual conference, then known that Microsoft had also registered an appropriate patent in November.
However, in conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the business scientists.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with just hands and creating virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of human and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has been stuck mostly in the phase where pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox will be sold without Kinect, since all are interested in movement control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these cheated Virtual Reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overestimated?
- It is certainly not the full purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all of them about his actions and intents.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but every one in its particular nose.
For example, we worked in the field of controlling objects on public places at a project where we experimented with short and button, instead of with invited gests.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretical could be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as geography and language.
- How?
- We would ask me to give you this sprudeldosis?
They say it and suggest it at the same time.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Do you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time, we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which enables people to get more precise reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Does it lack dissolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main matter is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of humans are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with a regulated processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Doesn't need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system, where we could play with different camera necessities to determine how this helps us to identify a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember rightly, Microsoft presented his glasses not to the public in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think the following: the most great variant would be a "changed" extended reality where we could switch over a cloud from the glass to the smartphone,
The briller is a personal gadget and there is its strength (Privates can only be seen), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual Holog frames in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: there is no feelingable reaction!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers do your group want to give to this impression?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in interaction between human and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of the tactle perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She's taking a great deal of pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at granting the "images in the air" something hand-fast, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a particular point where the finger is located generates a feeling that is at present, but still as weak as a person was breathing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the handgle that affect the nervous ends in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlist the brain?
It makes it feel what it should feel if it's just seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here, another task that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically located in a closed room, is to believe that it is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
Until now, the brain can only be moderately overlisted, and there are many working years in front of us.
Just this makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city residents who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the read list already high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the wearer dressed in red, which is once touched at the Russian Museum, even at the summer garden, at the scene barleys or on defeat.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social-philosophy artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street, he is a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and gives them a good laugh.
Recently, he grabbed a spinorgel and became a Petersburg spinorel player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's being, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or doorkis in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that interferes with the optic and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In society, everything that deviates something from the grunorm, excites aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to the people through my provocations.
Every one of my last provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newski Culture Palace, where my work was posted.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended at that time, and new and free painters like me were inappropriate.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Pushkinskaja 10" was created and then only ended.
I draw it to the theater, to the fashion, to music, actually to everything, except the literature.
It was important for me to stand in the centre of Petersburg's culture where the best creative artists were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artificial club for the Bohemia, the house of Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, carried close trikots and belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group started playing live, her "Leningrad" became.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Hali-Gali".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned from us.
The gallerie "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our employees and family guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was an survey in the press, which was about the award "Performances of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and thereby I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Cloudns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it pains and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it's all blurring and losing his tragedy.
I love the Greatske, and I have bigske ideas.
For example, let us save the world by predicting that everyone has complete clothes.
Everyone now pays attention to the clothes and orientes himself on the outside and not on the inside of the man.
But maybe you should not give a man the hand, but suck it in the face.
The fake disappears by clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of the city's spinorel player.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerable and smooth.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, the people formed large groups: the Bohemias loved the One and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- The appearances of Stas Michailow come several thousand!
- To him, abandoned women, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there are fewer management, money, and everything goes under.
I have trailers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not destroy the accomplishment.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that even hang in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said, servants of culture.
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
In the real cereals it was different, because the cereals may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they will be blocked because more high-grade experts need to evaluate the first and free the way.
It's just your own taste now.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don't have to accept all contemporary arts and some painters are therefore looking for other museums.
What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient floor.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrition floor, for, for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art has to be modern again, like at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the World Room
Earth in danger.
Heating or collision with chillrasteroid.
Karawans from space ships with earthly inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is how we can grow up in severity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least be in a hypothetical place.
"Mars and Venus" says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be in a large height or in the circuit of the Venus, i.e. in all, possible.
The question of reproduction in all the researchers first addressed with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out once a half centuries before.
The fourth generation of the heritage grown in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earth's species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Watchtleier was sent to the world's room to explore the impact of severity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must find hold; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground, the chicks were overwhelmed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely stumbled.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slope and then put the whole thing in because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew maintains the failure experiment with the chicks in all.
The last brute cake with animals fled into the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 the experiments will be continued.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats that have already been sent to all.
In principle, nothing special was identified.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got grown.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are shaken from their natural habitats can simply not follow their reproduction drive.
Unlike animals, the human could be principal.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our Möve fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says the room vacation veteran Wachang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after their space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawiskaja, who was two times in the orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, was a son.
Yet, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy descendants.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in flights in the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, mankind must search for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor at the preparing centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
The cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space here in a sweat state.
The water represents the severity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ignorant testifies that life at the country disappeared the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is located in the mother’s stomach in the fruitwater, and that it can then be easier to use water.
In principle, it is logical, since from birth to first swimming just two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child the weakness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of severity, the stomach and basin muscles are very rapidly decreasing the ability to push the child out.
All right, we're dealing with the introductory tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the unimportant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the dancing, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an orbit like a adult for training in a load dress.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment that we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the world of a disabled person, a perfectly inappropriate person," predicts the leader of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world's room is only theory.
But at some point it will be real when the earth’s inhabitants in their space ships break up to a remote planet, which will be the home for their descendants in all.
NKU-Chef: Control of the Black System fails by political debts
In connection with public contracts, Czech Republic has good control procedures and appropriate laws, but falls within its application.
The President of the Supreme Control Office (Novyší controlní úřad, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is not the case for us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harm the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it can not just come to the Chairman of the Government, and the control body whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, in its activities," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Control, you talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries were compared in respect of public contracts.
What was it about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is about the European legislation to determine how public contracts are to be handled, which builds up national legislation, and finally, there is still the actual practical application.
This all we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have been able to find very interesting differences. Generally, the laws in us may even be a bit more stringent and perfect, but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again, and it is also necessary to consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help for you? What is the result of this project for you?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and to reduce and evacuate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means to acquire one thing at a reasonable price (not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we only burden the system with an excessive "payer crochet" and those seeking gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech grant law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German Pendant is the NCU of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is built similarly as with us and also has a college that is merely a little different, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
Competencies are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these accounts are also available in each country - in which the German system is different from our.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which correspond to our public funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting courts.
What the German legislation concerns is the simpler than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific information, but in some respects, Germany is often described as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Maybe it's because there's better inspectors there?
That is certainly not, but, as I said, such comparisons I don't like particularly.
To this end, it is noted that the countries that are an example for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of cooperation with our authority, wouldn't they?
As regards the Czech legislation, what was the importance of the novellation of the granting law for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
Given that this novell is only in force for a short time, it does not yet affect our tests.
Since our controls are carried out afterwards, you have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we feel more effective in the preparing phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detecting risks of ineconomicity" and examined and analyzed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain kinds of tenders have been modified, including.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system in charge of further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this acceptance will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are "treated" and can no longer be complied with.
In the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional Council, the audited persons shall be responsible for any non-compliance with the law of the granting of a infringement of the budgetary discipline.
But is it useful to make the law even more stringent?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a misunderstanding that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let's say what way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the Black System now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then the President of the Government can not simply come, and the control body whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law can be obliged to work.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing.
The granting law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and that is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is missing in us.
On the streets, single ice slides are, however, mostly dry.
On the streets of Czech Republic, there are partially snow and ice slides.
However, most of the roads are well travelable, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well travelable this morning, singlely dominated snow and ice glates.
The temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 °C, it is supposed to be a little warmer every day.
In the region it is no longer cutting, and in the deeper heights it remains only a thin snow cover.
On the caves of the arch mountain, however, it is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, the view was restricted because of fools.
The highway R6 and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently unlimited.
For example, however, attention is given to bridges that sometimes require and smooth to the roads.
Similarly, all roadways of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, are operated.
On these roads, however, it remains gradually required or outdated snow residues.
In particular in the higher layers, the attention is therefore increased.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads Eastern Böhmens there is danger for ice glätts, in higher layers and in the mountains there is sometimes another excavated snow layer on the streets, informing the road and motorway directories on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers against ice glätts, which can occur in particular in higher layers in the Pardubice district.
In particular, it can be found on roads of the second and third road class in the circles Lanšcroron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountain Orlické hory.
An expensive snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohren, it is mostly sunny or hoter today, and it remains largely free of defeat.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in Pilsen's district are well travelable today, however, there is an increase in attention locally, and the roads are to be adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it cut before and then the temperatures fell, it can come to ice glates on the streets.
It is also expected to be fooled locally, but the view will improve during the day.
This information is derived from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, however, increasing attention recommends the road championships between the 80th and the 131th kilometres.
The pathways of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can be cut into ice slides.
The pathways of the second and third road class are moisturised, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
Chief drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the field of Böhmerwald.
District Olomouc
Snowmatch has to calculate today drivers who are on the way to the heights in the district of Olomouc.
After use of spray vehicles, snow match remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The nightly snow drive forced the street championships to use, in the Šumpern circle, according to road management information about 3 cm new snow.
In the rest of the district, the roadways are mostly unlimited.
"In the circle Šumperon remains in the heights still snowrests.
On the passport Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to calculate snowmatsch towards Jesseník," said a road manager Šumpaar today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the circuit of Jesseník also had to get out in the night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimited, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still moist.
District Ústí nad Labem, Liberec District
In northern trees, the road championships report several bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glätts, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí N.K. circuit is locked, according to the transport police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the depth levels, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported.
Ice slides are reported in particular from the circuit of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - day on rain and melting snow, in the night of cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes and from the road I/13 at the border of the Ústí district and Liberec, bad transport conditions are reported.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to aests, which were pressed from snow load to roadway.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is that we should take place in less than one month of world decline?
This is one of those catastrophes that we like to go to people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap Tap, we are rather funny about it and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world downturn.
In December you also realise a unique project with three concerts against world decline.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a country-wide benefit event that we have planned for two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place at the same time at 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be in about the time at which the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone of 12 hours before us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally I think, then we designed the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We want to collect not only enough positive energy to prevent world decline, but also to think together with the public about the state in which we once give this world our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key attachers against the world decline, with which the people can also support us via www.e-pap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap Tap Tap has also taken up the sog. Hymne against the world decline with the title "World decline falls out" together with other artists.
Today, the Hymne is very popular on YouTube. Will it come to the benefit concerts?
Of course, and to the end, provided that everything works and the world's decline doesn't take place...
The Hymne is to be sung by all artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transferred lively in a direct conservation of the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X singing with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech Culture scene, which is related to the realisation of many benefits events and concerts...
We are trying to intensely integrate these people into our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What purpose does the redemption of the concerts benefit from world decline?
For the establishment of the Availability Education Centre Studeo, where we have been working with the association Tap in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly managed by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a own building will be created, and we will then take part in this project.
There are several groups and artists in each group.
What criteria have you chosen these?
We wanted to set up a program that talks to all generations including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appears in Prague.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we first appear at Prague Spring, and we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would like to connect this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with these travels logistics and organizational?
It's not as bad as it appears at the first look.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Of course, we have to sleep with many instrument bags and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems until now, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks in each country with accessibility, how to deal with handicapped people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses in Russia that in the east, everything is still in its beginning.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not obstacles. There it is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is on his own in the city centre.
It is not even of course there that you prefer a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Happyly, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways must we pick up against the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things in which we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improvements in the situation are always dependent on the efforts of stakeholders.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just common that there is a larger group of people with disabilities actively involved in social events, we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series will things really begin to change.
Until now, these are only individual cases of particularly deliberate personalities.
The Tap Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to build a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensive.
And since I myself am a musician and play, including Saxofon, I found a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, it is, as our Moderator, Lá
But the band was only known in recent years, or do I mislead myself?
It is true that cooperation with known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that, if you do something and you do not see it outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential for you to deal with things differently.
In the show business today often copies one another.
This is logical in his way, since everything new is considered with caution and is only accepted after longer time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare to say that tap tape belongs to them.
The first impression most of the viewer is of course compassion; that is only of course...
But this compassion is absolutely overwhelming because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we need to regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also require a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have two times a week's test, have to graduate preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm will eliminate the enthusiasm of many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band who wants to work seriously and achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá
We're an open group, the people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join is always welcome to us.
Finds instead of the day before the forecast world down, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Event sites are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three places of event are finally connected by live scenario and a common interpretation of the Hymne "Weltfall falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap Tap.
The concert aims to provide the funds for the provision of a multifunctionally disabled education centre that will be created under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was taken into account as the twentieth member of this space authority at a Ministerial Council meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland to space began freely much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasmed with space travel, not always on understanding.
I remember here, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warschauer Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Income to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Prix REP-hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Income to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important prosecutor of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was also appreciated by the name of one of the craters on the earth-depleted side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even explained whether the missile should be used to start or brake the draisine.
This information is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infanterie began to deal with rocketed shots.
In collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi, the research work conducted the Institute Comórka Techniki Uzbrojenia.
From the handed documents, it is clear that research was carried out until the stage of practical tests.
Research was then freely interrupted by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937, in the specialized press of the design of a photoelectrical hunting draket from Ing. Rohoziński, the work "Rakitea - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared in the following year.
Both projects were dealing with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Tymczasowy Komité Doradczo-Naukowy.
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was terminated from the beginning of war.
Further articles on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first wording of this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the Magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a spatial society.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was foreseen that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already at their beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the 1951 International Federation for Space Travel, and actually the PTA became a ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Chairman of the International Federation for Space Travel.
This office he had entered until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (rakitea meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and does not weigh a total of 5 kg.
Later, a improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, the Błłdów desert began flight tests with the two-level RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighted about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the raket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14,5 km and be used for the monitoring of height winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was discontinued.
Following the first rocket of type RM, the meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-level rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from these rockets, which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A route had a transport space of 0.4 litres, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the meteor-2-raketes were developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg benefit load at a height of about 60 km.
Afterwards, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
At the same time, Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic of Vladimír Remek.
The rejection of the law on non-profit work is no solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision raised a vigorous discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem of a wider perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, handing in hand with unfit financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (loans) there are price voltages.
This is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to exist in economic competition through imports of favourable goods by "underbuilding" competition in order to reduce a greater market share and increase its profit.
In large terms, this means for most companies to move their production to abroad or to buy them in favour of it, or to give up their business, and the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and thus does not bear responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure will necessarily increase.
This situation is still strengthened by the fact that the Gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and by replacing the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are overflowing at this point.
The unreasonable practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without taking into account the social consequences.
This is in particular the case of changes in existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
This is one of the economic forces in the event of long-term unemployment, and, secondly, by cutting the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
For several years in Germany, there have been public food charges for arms that are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of stakeholders already goes into the millions.
During the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where employees receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Federal Day.
The savings measures in practically all EU South states will undoubtedly go beyond the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage at the edge of society and hope that private investment capital will be flown into the country at any time.
Here, naturally, is the question where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only the poverty is going from one country to another; or the capital remains equally completely because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, the employees at all work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media argue that the State may not participate in its own economy and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists closely in its view that the State is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own self-egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practical all-mighted and all-environmental lobby in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, the mutual advantage, a legislation, in which practically everything is thorough, but nothing can be punished.
In Germany, the situation is that a State Ministry has a lack of finances private, close to industry-founded legal undertakings in order to draw up legislative drafts.
These draft legislation will then be adopted on the Federal Day.
All violence then does not go out of the people, as it announces the Western Constitutions, but of strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal Democracies are at present in a situation that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeius describes: "The state has been deceived for a long time, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against smutter money, by unlawful ease of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew obstaclelessly, and the people went to vote with already bought voices" ... "Men with character did not pursue themselves for offices, so that the state had no consult for eight months due to this decline" ... "You were already beginning to talk about the only medicine in this severe situation being a single rule, and that a strong man must be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then then the Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it appears, today's society as well as in ancient times is based on the unreasonable preference of its own advantage, without respect for social interests.
The private capital has not already been able from its nature to recognise and carry out the benefit of the whole society.
The result, like today, is an unprecedented decade of elites who do not in the least seek deep reforms.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and Communism must therefore be searched for in the unreasonable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the decline of these regimes to the benefit of liberal democracy can be considered as a certain break, where the next round is already declined.
In particular, the disaster is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in perfect ignorement.
The suspension of the law on non-profit work is no solution here, at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the State in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing originates from violence or could ever arise" Sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...that we don't forget how violent we are."
"If my sons didn't want to war, there was no one," says the dying good schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip there were, as always, a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while they mention the Palestinians as terrorists; the others, on the other hand, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the people murder committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the State Israel as terrorist.
I would not like to write in this place about who is in this ever-recovering waves of killing and who is victims; finally, the people of Israel today, including self-management, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about opening the view of the readers behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) is most of the benefit of the small spot land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every Epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question whether it was really all these personalities themselves who determined their steps independently, or whether behind their throne someone who was leading their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world is less concentrated in the hand, and that this concentration of money and power resulting from it has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a special point is that could be described as the head of the crochet (I don't know if anybody still stands over them, but I don't exclude this) - the red shield.
A lot is not written about them.
I understand.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century in order to prevent the connection of their name with high-criminal deeds, in whose background the strengthening of their power, the increase of their assets or both of them was always abundant.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they lead wars or ruin themselves on them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq, it were five countries, after the crash of Ghaddafis, only four more, where Russia in the meantime subscribed to its central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to face this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue its own banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to cancel the FED - he was murdered in 1963; MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to complain for the FED for the trigger of the world economy crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global army of the Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the defeat of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free murderer of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed at eliminating the large monarchist states of Europe, in particular by the second war, the colonial rule of the United Kingdom should be broken, and the third war is intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a such number would provide for their pleas and luxury and would not also consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the preliminary) and ultimately lead to the takeover of the absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families work with the red shields at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao order from the chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED, so that crises such as the crises which they triggered in 1907 are not repeated).
After they had been able to trigger the first world war by the murder of the Habsburg Thronvolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zaren Empire through the revolution of Bolshevik.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfunded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zaren Empire was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Mediterranean great power of Austria-Ungarn took place.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, the bankers made a late conflict situation through politics by placing Germany with gigantic war repairs; thus they created the condition of armed masses, so that they only had to undergo the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debtors designated and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-voluntary state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column and also took it to eliminate the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch strived to establish a Jewish state, as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first collisions with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was loose from the chain at which the international bankers had held it at the beginning, or whether everything went to plan, it is only difficult to estimate, at least the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state through the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers are able to disfellowship this war, the Jewish people will be like in the Second World War as a victim in the front line, this time together with the Arabic and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge lab, a source of battle and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you only think how sharply people were divided into Israel's adherents and opponents).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only tries in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the desire of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as with us, the people, only make their own candidates a choice.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist attack, loyally devoted to the international bankers, who do everything to facilitate a war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanhaier Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and, because of Iran’s control over the only two miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of the global oil supplys, could come to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a all-through crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to undergo this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the greats, the riches and the poor, the frees and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their head that no one can buy or sell, because he has the painting sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whosoever has understanding, considers the number of the animal.
For it is a number of men, and its number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomas as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the crashed Shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution into the USA, who had preserved the patronate over his regime over decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she couldn't be able to throw the shake on board, because this would have massively damaged the confidence of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to carry out the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution was to establish a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy struggle for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent Fiasko in the violent attempt of gissel liberation made everything worse.
After 444 days after the negotiations had been communicated by the algeric government, the diplomas captured were finally released.
The fate of the hostages called at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-iranic moods.
The Debakel in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan at the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actress Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story, which declared a small partial victory to the United States.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the Residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover their true identity - they traveled crushed with Canadian passports as members of a cinema that was supposed to visit the country's turning place for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic police trillor, but at the same time also a "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful housemare piece, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus, the film changes the levels of mood - on one side the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film recording of the same situations).
On the other hand, the more relaxed passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily overspread.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions - men in dresses at the meeting table, on the office flurries, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career with this movie.
From a smiled actress, a respectable director has become, and as an actress he is no longer the goal of ironic notes.
Argo is his third play film after the Crime No Child Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thrill city without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflcks first movie that doesn't play in the local Boston director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the features of the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the entrance sequence of the disturbance of the message is very impressive in their overview, yet, in the meantime, the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Similarly, Affleck with his team also achieves a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false film stack on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to confront with the fact that the story actually does not offer a lot of exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
But with the smaller, he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran is disappeared by a calling in America, or also the pursuit of persecution on the startway, works something).
The weakness of Argo is its too widespread spread, which is conditional on the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and thus they are far not alone in the movie.
Affleck film loses a bit of traction. It is a film that can be pursued with some interest with the design and the retro style of a thrill from the 70th years.
However, it is hard to raise enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a certain living piece of history to this day, and as a proof of how the ideas of all-might and all-aware secret services are taken over, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who calls for an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the recently proposed EU plan to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, compared with the newspaper Právo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of the rates of insurance for men and women is based on the nominated absurdities.
Until now, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible events from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," he informed.
The controversial EU Regulations include the binding interaction of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the directive on the size of chickens, which has been significantly expensive during this year.
In the past, criticism also harvested the factual prohibition of the use of the term "Butter Stretch" or also the selling ban for conventional bears.
bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (such as the Czech Republic is currently trying to carry out the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the need for bananas to be the highest trading class in the EU to be at least 14 cm long and no "creaming anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonizes the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the existing directives would lead to the waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year, which, in accordance with air balloons, must be provided with an indication that children under eight years of age may not blow up the airballon without supervision of a adult.
The EU called for an American study which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of the intrusion of children.
Similar restrictions are already applicable for children up to 14 years in the use of year market hits.
Curiose Infalls are also available at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns European officials themselves - everyone who takes an official role in the EU may not use the name Macedonia for the reasons for the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must say FYROM (Forma Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Association of Liberal Economies Laissez Faire, the Server Bankovnípoplatky.com also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in a Member State.
The EU thus sets the maximum volume of food stocks which could be held on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume for swamp conserves, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organisations of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, but of the idea of granting funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were freely not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement for the EU," explained in the autumn of 2004, then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As a argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchase.
Since Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funds for applications for funding offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), should be used in particular as funds for the settlement of funds applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, regulations in Member States are easy to achieve the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to achieve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, some experts believe that it is more acceptable.
A more serious problem is, according to these experts, rather the EU funds for projects that have nothing to do with the depth of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also raise the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the use of specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Czech Republic could defend the name "Olomoucké tvar
The name Rum may only be used for products of sugar tube destillate, not for products of sugar tubes.
The official list of products registered in the EU now shows in the society of the world famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinkens, the Karlsbader Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třeboć, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the pardubic lebcake or the Hořic rolls can be used.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you come to the idea of candidates for the President's office?
It's not about being senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I wouldn't know anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or the President.
In the Senate, you did it and then made it straight on the way to the castle.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I have been told all the time that I will take up the fight about the castle after the result of Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will be candidate for the President's office, provided that I am elected to the Senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument that I can realise my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a people in the knee and in front of the television, but to make everyone who wants to change something.
The media that want to rob you of the honour come to this end, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom of lie.
For example, it was claimed that I would be buying journalists or that I was advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight about the castle has taken up over 20 million kroner with these of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as back-acting asset statements.
To this end, you have to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used to ensure that the guide remains a free business, and this could be done.
The problem is the small spirit policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless man, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is the best for our country, without shovel thoughts and partial ideas from every party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I think the people are looking at me to the left.
But for me this right-left thought is absolutely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we get on.
It's not about me whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You're disgraced if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to draw closer to this.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament you will only remain tags.
And so you do not get far in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to the people for a long time, will you succeed, for example, in carrying out material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
Politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the presidents of Parliament's parties live on television to legally impose the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would then have to say why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to errors can exercise pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the President, who was a favor of public pressure.
I am clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with the policy and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like if Okamura was supposed to save Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I do not reach anything alone; therefore I have spoken with several known personalities about whether they do not want to candidate for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to work for overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in dealing with light heat oil.
My candidatur I started with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the Foundation.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of civil championships and district captains.
Do you think about the establishment of a own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member and not even have the money for it.
I haven't even money for the president's campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20 000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
I estimate my private capacity to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million, and then I have a few million more on the account.
The Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond always liked me as he was driving in the car, galant to women and fighting the evil at the same time.
You drive a Aston Martin, have an asset of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme probably does not raise too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to reject the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are actually covered by my salary as Senator.
But I could not live alone from senators' salary; for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn't make anything.
So do you continue working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to take these activities back?
But this does not depend on the amount of the wage.
As promised, I have partly lost my activities.
For example, my chairman in spring will be the Executive Director of the Travel Office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something, too.
What monthly income were you used to be an entrepreneur?
Some 200 000 to 400 000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would put my businesses in full.
The full conversation is available in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - on the example of spijkes and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant at the road edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT engineer in a nearby large business, says, "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a booklet for today.
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntarily going to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spigments, a hardly visited sleeping city in front of Rotterdam's gates, are an outstanding record holder.
The 80 000 inhabitants show the lowest educational rate in all the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, you decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges that are shown on the Euroscheins as beautifully brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational officials remained in boundaries.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to become statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, Master of the magnificent bar charts and producers of funny and often cynical buildings, took the case with usual leave and appeared to competition hearing inno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still sorrowing around and sucking with the axles, the cheerful maas stacked his reader gifts of size to a pyramid and ended his actually undermined speech with the words: "Dear city communes!"
So he is, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountains have been shaken.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent housing and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
The bookberg was awarded at the beginning of November with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the familiar small town retorte, which was no longer available until the date than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a concisely foolish council house, behind its white facades, would be inclined to suspect a molecular factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
In particular, however, spices now have the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under Cheseglocke.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain mass, but the true room and reader joys are encountered in the feeting of the topography.
The around glazing interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanes speak inevitably the language of a public city place.
The urban ambient is perfect.
You already keep a look at the park bank, dog and football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally, the books are located along the facade, and in the middle is a large, darker space, which is mostly unmarried and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on the head and stolen the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is used: In the centre, offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and home technology centres are located.
A special joy are the black book lines that are sometimes wall clothing, times bathing, times staggering lands.
Optics, haptics and smells are strange.
Even inflicted architects and engineers shake the head of the unknown construction material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the city community spykings, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, we have struck for a suitable waste from agriculture in a freshland farm.
For many years you have been using a millimeter thin plastic leaflet in the Netherlands in crop houses and on fields as root.
This is cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is mature for the locking waste.
For the library, the vines - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters of thick plates.
Under heat influence and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) paints into a dark, homogeneous, burdenful material that smells a bit to new cars and a bit to sports shoes.
After 105 stages, you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters walking, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and inclined ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right air humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a project in puncto ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Built and cooled with earth heat.
Although the bookberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself seems only shortly in the inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden limbs, which are crossed to the glass feather, serve as an estimate and capture a large part of the sun’s insulation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest make full-automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already waged the way to the new bookhouse.
Lisette Haig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Bookenberg as a spice of the "last overwhelming soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each inhabitant was invited to spend a book from his personal stock.
This is first of all intended to fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - that is not yet fully covered.
The concept has ended up.
The rolls are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-lear library," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the crop.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in that king's discipline, which is called Identity Foundation.
Spices have written literature history.
So young and unbilded she may also be.
This is finally a approach for identity.
Szabo: "German must play greater role"
Germany has taken part in the vote on the adoption of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in U.S. European relations, Berlin balances this at a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for a observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained himself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that it does not also support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - but not to be too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held the vote when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally carried out by the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to make a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy, which has been managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They expect them to play an independenter role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still pressing on their role, but they are on their way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or the United Kingdom.
What, then, is a "normal" foreign policy specifically from a German viewpoint?
It shows the willingness to involve positions independent of those of the United States or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Do these economic interests have an impact on the position of the Conflict of Nahosts and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to put the public, but also to the elites, in the Arab countries.
That doesn't matter anyway.
But I would not like to measure it too much weight, that's not a total unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by taking part in important decisions of the vote, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic fraction as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as international players and its interests.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama may have a lot of understanding in secret for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences in opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so excited by Netanjahus policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead must drive things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This was always a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play an independenter role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - will Germany take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the leadership role difficult?
Germany is not used to do so, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the Euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Germany is thus in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be convenient for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European policy continues to decline, but the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, who else remains there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and it makes a lot more unloved - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what's Armani Polo?
A name which is officially registered in China remains behind it, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Still, she enjoys protection as long as the real namegivers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing Kanzlei, specialized in protective rights infringements in Fernost.
Every week, a new case is on my desk.
The followers already reach a few additional letters so that they can register their brands.
Thus, from Gucci will simply be Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company had the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, which also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese world champions are in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multituded shopping houses that sell almost exclusively falses.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a bike brand.
The word is directed to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who are fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"That's business damage, you have to fight it," calls Pattloch.
"The brand is watered that disappears the sole setting, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in expensive stock products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be withdrawn, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the Court refused to complain because after the long term of the claimed name had become "marketrality".
If the complainant has pech, he has to pay even money to the plagier because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here is the law of the jungle.
Favoured cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with the construction engine manufacturer Sany, that company who recently took over the German concrete pump engineer cleaner.
Consequently, the Chinese may use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was illuminated, Geely had to change it.
The fashion producer Lacoste lost in China against afterahmer from Hong Kong and Singapore, which led the famous crokodile to the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there was a lack of staff and space facilities in 2010.
Last year, however, it was "returned from the working situation to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed prosecution procedures should be reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 inquiries are still waiting for execution in the office.
On the other hand, it takes a lot to deal with
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were received by the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and indicates that China is referring to the list of new applications in all the world for the tenth time in each other, the Authority shall notify.
This was also valid for the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011 1,8 billion Yuan was taken at fees.
Simplifiedly, each login at the cut is costing 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, the case of the German family company Freudenberg costs a multiple.
For more than seven years, the group has fought a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal production was removed from the imitation of motor vehicles.
However, the simulator continued to secure Chinese rights at the brand Freudenberg.
It has been missed, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the claim of the coins.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the processor continues to fight until today.
You have to be careful.
The case is now attached to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely exhaustive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly detected that the company's archive has even had to look through a hundred years old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Joyberg of the opposite forgively offered a "height six-digit euro amount" for reconciliation.
"You see how much that is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost even threaten to fall back to Europe.
Then, when imitationators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long left the group, yet he could reverse the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advises German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should "log in to China everything, which is somewhat protective," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would have to pay the opposite side license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in this segment.
World Aid Day: Stamps, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS swaisen are proud of it.
The history of a connection that survives far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, the stamp is: Cowboy's boot, basketball shoes, women pumps and master lippers are looking for the pace on the parket floor, finding it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell on - old, bass, tenor and sopran - press, bet and persecution.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his sleeve wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi proclaims a new song.
The fifty singers and singers have come from 23 to 69 years of age, from the human genetiker to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has another text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken of 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are about 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which estimates unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live of them in South Africa.
In Swasiland, 245,000 AIDS swaisses live.
More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the Verein Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them visit a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means at Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The bantu language can speak fluidly in this room no one can sing but.
For nearly ten years, the choir has practiced soft language in this foreign language and brings it back and back to the place where they originate: in the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 km from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting force of the German Chores.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2000 people live there, some still in simple lambs and stroh cabinets, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they are generating the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it is shown in the small one, from which all Swasiland is ill: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Cutting the male precutaneous skin, which prove to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weak virus in themselves, with mid thirty-three to die is no rareness.
At a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which it was not only lacking in parental care, but simply on everything: food, clothing, education.
There is no chance in a poor country without a graduation of school.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to have a warm meal on the day.
But since a year later, the Chor founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally cared for the AIDS wheat in Esitjeni since.
Features of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, Chlamydiene and Tripper (Gonorrhoe).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human paepilomavires, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filtles and scratches belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are especially present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydiene infections, trichomonads, candidose (Pilz), tripper and human papilomavirs are frequent sexually transmitted diseases.
HIV spread is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet, around 20 percent of HIV new infections are affected by this group.
Chlamydiene infections are much more frequent among adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections involve young people aged between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papilomavirs are frequently present in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be notified.
According to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, the number of Syphilis infections has doubled more than 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sex disease?
Infection diseases may cause injuries in the genital area, urination disorders, outflows, subcutaneous pain, and bleeds or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because, in part, the tract of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by mud infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts especially recommend regular investigations in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnostics can help most STI cure and avoid late successes.
Through patents, donations and not least the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, some things come together.
"As a whole, we have already sent about EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and violent woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the beasts to come well, with one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, as called the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 waises, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear timely for school education every day.
Whoever has no one more, comes into the protective house of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two kitchens that are cooking for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "voices for Africa" has launched a neat school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many have made an HIV test in the village.
This is not self-consciousness, because so obviously the disease throughout the country is also, you sweat it most dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country in which the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
It is also guilty of this stately sanctified form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers who carry the virus through the country.
Although free condoms were at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa, singing songs full of temperament, fight spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many know on the southern side of the Black Continent still from the times of the apartheid.
A bus full of white ones that sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only emotion and joy, but also some grievous border soldiers have already cut off a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patriarchs.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of Ezulweni River.
"Going to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stampling singers in the sample room at the Bergheimer Straße, then you see it also shine.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although it is next to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as is shown in three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently located region of the planet.
It should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from cometes or possibly also asteroids that are enrolled on the Mercury.
No one brings the foundation of ice but related to the existence of life on the planet, said the Chief Scientist of Messenger-Sound, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings can help to clarify how water and other building stones of life have arrived in other areas of the sun system.
Unnotified by the earth's citizens, sins, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of the world.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: small guckholes in infinite wides.
The picture comes from a camera that has developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who created behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This portrait of an infrared recording of the Spitzer Telescope shows a "Family portrait" of unnumbered star generations: The oldest stars are identified as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink-coloured "newborn" in the star's hall.
This star-bilding region - called unromantically W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the Cassiopeia star image, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shilling glow of a dying star has taken the top telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that swallowed the star out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are from gas and dust.
The Spitzer Telescope of Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The Plejaden Star Hope, also called "The seven Sisters", can be seen with the only eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity to a earthly continent brought this fool to the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and his rings: As these have been created, one of the big puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remnants of a Saturn-Mond that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies are made to true artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Queen shows the several thousand light years away trifid nebula in the star image protector.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-shaped), as dark dust stripes threeth the glowing heart of the stars' birthplace.
Astronomers photographed the prebodies of a cosmic caram company: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies run to each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who are not technical abbreviations, it may call it at its nickname Southern Firecycle.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the Iris Nebel in the star image Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than usual dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientist UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars is our dairy road.
The star weighs always produce new youths.
Also these star clouds, associated with the rosette nebel, brings ongoing new babysitters - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this light-raying galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was created shortly after the Urknall, when mostly hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into All: The most important telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galileo used it for star observation one year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown increasingly - and the insights they deliver have grown deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest remote tube in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Great Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows looks into all right over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet, he reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
Disadvantage of the cheap ways of construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its specificity: the high light collection power.
This is, despite a relatively small mirror diameter, sufficient to the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to all the signals from outside earth.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing accounting performance.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory of Stars (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - that makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also light the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main level will include 42 meters - and is composed of nearly 1000 mirrors.
However, it is early for 2018 to be calculated with pictures.
By 2007, the two chain telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulcan Mauna Kea were considered the largest of the world.
They offer equally two mirrors with one average of ten metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, besides them, still looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea will also create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be surprised on a Illustration.
However, the main impressions from the All provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, images have already been delivered from remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been determined since mission start.
In the picture, the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at the beginning of 2018 on board a Ariane5-rakete.
The primary level of the space infrarotelescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also at the South Pole of the Mercury Ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messengers cream far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have meant for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the Messenger sound started in 2004 - the first one creating around the Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Daily drinking butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long life.
A track search in the country in which 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long life.
A track search in the country in which 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountain is wilddromant.
The small bus rubbles over the curven-rich street, passing closely forested hills, riving rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything's green and soft, you might think you're in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here is the Caucasian group of Talys, which is not much known, except that it is perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very long-lived.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is spreading with too weested architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the painting mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too difficult is the approach to the capital of Baku of Azerbaijan.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours because the road is only a peak.
The magnificent wealth that the country thanks for its oil in the Kaspical Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longlife, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita documented by about eight dozen valleys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
A child witnessed at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Širali Müslomov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented people aged 122, Müslomov's age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times, and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he should have witnessed another daughter.
So did Širali Müslomov figure out at his age about a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the high-paids in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-old people in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, because of the lack of documents, no scientific evidence of age should be carried out, mainly because of the lack of personal status registers.
Bigly melted butter every day
In fact, however, the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years old.
So why live so many high-aged people here in the south?
Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the diet.
But that the calorific cost of the valleys is to be so healthy that the meat, bread and mainly milk products love, and many of which drink a glass of butter smoking daily, is not just plausible from nutrition sight.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengeiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Kaukasus region.
She is sitting on the floor with a butterflies that she rolls down and down indefinitely.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are grandparents long.
Two kids also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests of tea served in the typical, built-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in rice and leather, under her headtuch she leaves long, dark-blown teeth that reveal her son proudly before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pensions sufficient to live
She has always eaten just what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
For my whole life, I haven't bought food for a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
The worst thing was in the time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rope.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the culture that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the ruder.
There's always no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro) receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for these conditions a amount of which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayevas has been right for a long time: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the grand family, are loved, cared and happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "Mental Right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising census in Cairo reveals the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharah as a basis is severely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian coppers, the liberals, exposed Muslims and Seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly crushed in a confusive opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of Gnades of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, so said Mohammed Mursi almost excusingly cut the competences of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded his competences, "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral title of the American University of South California, really wants to save, is the Egyptians, the world is not completely clear.
Should the Judicative be destroyed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been covered by the islamistly dominated 100-headed Constitutional Assembly, are partly exciting in a nightly, 15-hour parforce trip.
As in previous constitutions, it is in the draft, justice is based on the "principes of Islamic law".
But what does "principes" mean?
This was and is an interpretation and it is fearful that the Islamists will use the floating formula and the corresponding legal gaming space for a more stringent interpretation of the sharah.
At least one new article is added: in all the matters concerned with Scharia, the Al-Ashar University must be taken into account, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation in the entire Sunnian Islam.
This is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy supervises the law, which de facto would lead to the disobedience of the Judicatives.
Many things in the draft author are the matter of interpretation
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction is to continue to maintain.
These courts served during the ruling of Mubaraks to underpress oppositionellas.
After the crash of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians sat in military war.
The State should also, as it is in the draft, "to protect the true beings of the Egyptian family" "and promote its morality and its values".
This is so sharply legally formulated that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature using this article.
In the clearxt, this means nothing but censur.
No other article expressly describes the equality of men and women.
For this another person forbids the prophet Mohammed and his messengers to offende or deceive.
But what is a contempt and how it should be handled, it remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios encourages the formula to be prohibited by the "punishment of men".
Is there already a carikature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Explanatory matter, as much as it is in the draft Mursi's signature and, according to his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for the people's vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the supreme power of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday evening on the Tahrir site in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prizemakers and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the Constitutional Draft belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through a short news service, Twitter, he visited Mursis' adherent to want to lead a "Putsch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and fall him," said the oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet rewarded," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blessed on its side for the contemporary demonstration, but carefully not on the Tahrir site, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Kairo University.
Many wiped women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked by Mursi, "Saugers the land!" and devoured, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the highness of the symbolic Tahrir site, where everything took its beginning, would probably have raised civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursis' trailers did not want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the constitutional draft and the prosecutors would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the electoral tour in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have actually been going until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or before court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world views, but because human rights are indispensable for him.
He was contested, condemned, imprisoned for this.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in discussion with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi Magnitude enlargement to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are irregular infringements of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto disappears it," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, including the international community, which views the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be a revenge.
A demonstration on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on fairly disgusting fish?
You will take a selection of overwhelmed cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And leave them there a week.
Sometimes you have to imagine the nose deep smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicatess of Norway.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this hardy smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is fermented with salt, which - depending on how stinking it would like - is fermented in water up to one year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flow to a festival here in Fagernes, which, now, is dedicated to really very exciting speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halfarsen, who actually works in the local fireguard, but also organises the festival as a so-called "rakfish general".
Towards us, people consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the rackfish," says Havard.
The spiritus can disturb the smell.
I'm costing some hips.
If you avoid bringing the rackfish near the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus journey behind.
Rakfish is the product of a very different, far worse Norwegian Epoch, when there were no cooling opportunities yet and fish in the autumn were drowned in air-tight salt water vessels.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after long fermentation and, undoubtedly, consumed by means of alcohol.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to look for work to leave their country and mostly wander into the United States.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a florating labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not far richer than Norway before, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential part of the Norwegian history, even though strictly smelling.
He belongs to the expensive courts that you can buy here.
But actually all of this is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist legal extremists who fought 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you only refer to the "precedential of July 22".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace - loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for the current richness of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our cellar, the round tablets distributed with mature rockfish and with her long blonde hair and the steaking blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a courageous people - as they say.
Their English is just like that of most people here wearless.
We're not very arbitrary, we don't like prailing.
Norway has handled its oil richness very carefully - a large part of the industry's acquisition is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years until the world economy crisis, all of them were thrown around with money that they did not have, Norway kept firmly locked his bankruptcy.
"As long as we can ride in winter ski and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfish," she adds with inexperienced laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
I'm sure that a eel-burger is something else.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is again on the food plan.
The hotel where I log is one of several places of event that organizes a rackfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell - fish.
There is a live TV scenario to a fly-coated showmaster surrounded by plates with rackfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're climbing and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinst of the whole fish.
Mexicos Enrique Pena Nieto stands for a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant analyses the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a stable city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important road routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim was, however, not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president's bonds and take the lead of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the divorcing government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove well economically, but the country is in the hands of a drug war that has cost 60,000 human lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto at Oval Office at the beginning of this week to the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he went to an eye with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was a governor of his country of Mexico.
In this closely populated part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions on the new Head of State have been shared.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small town of Valle del Bravo you would like to remember him.
Inhabitants of vacation commit him to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement to the breaching, hollow roads once there were.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," says his friend and political alliance Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congress member of the Pena Nietos Party.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Chairman Olvera acknowledges that after 12 years, the party has made great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos.
The prosecutions of the opposition, the new President lacks it from substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but especially he is someone who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and in many respects represents a city of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are crucial to urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to combat the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste deponie, only over the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statisticus that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is robbed for their violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has not addressed at least the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes before the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical for the downcoming quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was hit, and the body star had already used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is fit next to a cross that wears a single word: justice.
But precisely these, as the family, have been rejected her until now.
The authorities treated me like I was a sweater, anxiety founder, Nörgler.
You just want to accept their judgment and keep your mouth.
"But that is not possible if there were so many form faults and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been compassionate in the last six years of violence crime, and the new President has promised to take care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope he is as President as he was a governor," says the PRI Congress Chairman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The lawyer claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The lawyership contradicts Bradley Mannings' claims that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a rejection of the accusation due to severe arrest conditions
The U.S. arm's liberator is predicted to have used thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the state lawyer tried to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information of the US-American history - missed several opportunities to complain about the injury suffered by him in military.
At a cross hearing Mannings during a prejudicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Fine that documents for weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manings nine months in prison in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross hearing, which was held as a result of a request for defending the accusation - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the hard period of prison - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analysis of the U.S. Army, arrested in June 2010, is predicted to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fine with Manning went through the forms that officials had filled in in the Quantico Military Prison after their meeting with Manning during his prison, where he had entered under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although the officials Manning had asked directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials would have discussed them with him and indicated to deal with them, but they have not been logged.
"They wrote "No problems" (after meeting the concerns) and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that should examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that he was assigned this restrictive status - one step under the risk of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good to me, and get the status of observation to prevent injury (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my sight," said Manning.
Manning said that he was arrested and moved to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was arrested nearly two months before he was moved to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and had become unconscious once because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a ceiling, flip-flops, clothes and his bricks.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, for the day it had been prohibited to sleep or just lay down.
He has always had to sleep with light that ends from outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and wasn't able to see his face anymore, he was woke up to turn back.
In January 2011 Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico and have to stand naked before watchs and other prisoners at a morning counting.
Manning had said that during this counting he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling.
During the interview on Friday, Manning stated that he had closed from a command of his watch that he should drop the deck with which he could have covered, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked in the past night. He had previously tried to show an official that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning said to the official that he could have used the covenant of his subheadings or his Flip-flots to hurt himself, but it did not.
That night, Manning said, his subheadings, Flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his arrest experiences and drastically reduce his arrest, he should be condemned before the military court during his negotiation, which is appointed for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will confess less infringements for guilty, while other infringements which are considered too extreme are to be contempted.
Continuing the hearing is held for this weekend. The lawyer is expected to justify the terms of prison.
The Pentagon remains at its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners maintained under the highest safety precautions in Quantico.
The accusations against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he threatens a life-long penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them into memory difficult times, he says:
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when ratiness in me was widespread.
Painters referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexiccans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("residents").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called Mexicans for my whole life.
An ethnic accelerator - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irn" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for accelerators or binding lines.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a motherspeaker, and I won't lose my American accent too.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the serpent for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans today to stay with the same probability in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartel, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never disappear a single thought that in 1848 the United States fell into Mexico and forced the leadership of the country under a guilt to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the sons of Montezumas go on the war path.
And yet, the greatest challenge of Mexico is in truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live from Mexico in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent part - did not have any chance in Mexico and moved to the north.
And in most cases this person matched a profile - dark, unfounded, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose our mind that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty concerns, this is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves captured behind the silk fork - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally immigration in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this wrong.
While she is U.S. national, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are neither one nor another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their links with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unrighteous distribution of income, the uncovered corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through there alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico some half centuries ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grief for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" than I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
The state of arms between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace.
Can there ever be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The most recent bloody events seem to break such a hope in the cheim.
In the midst of the ordinary debt awards, numerous buildings were placed in shots and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelites killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were put in close to the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelites and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East turns around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these confusions.
Maybe this will only lead to more blood pouring.
But there are reasons for assuming that the deadly Patt situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first, optimism seems to be more than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms stopped on 21 November, the fighting in this week has strengthened the hard-dressers on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has been controlling the Gazastreifen since 2007, is claimed to have pushed the Israelites back, although its grouping had to show great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being invaded in one of the desolate and most densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas in the western land is gained, which is controlled by the rivalizing, moderate Palestinian Group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinforced regional power, once known as Israel's closest Muslim allies, has taken for the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Happy Hamas attachers believe that Israel is a Islamic semi-mond - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbolah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic representation could stand before the crash of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas' bonds threaten the king.
And in particular, the rising of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most inhabitant and most important Arab country, on the southern river of Israel, has changed the balance of the region in a sustainable way.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had only little time left for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are strongly dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pressed out by Israel and the United States.
On the other hand, the Israeli Hardliners make a contradictory conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas is no longer in danger.
The Israeli rocket defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds its position unhappy, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest scales of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process for many parts.
Although rockets from the Gaza strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide killers - not least thanks to the locking plants that have been invaded in the western continent and thereby, most of the part of a possible Palestinian state, which will continue to protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful for human rights, but continue to be expanded.
Netanyahu is a good place. His Likid party joined Avigdor Lieberman on 22 January in front of the elections.
Why do these distressed Palestinians also hide and leave their own state?
If they actually had control over the western land, would they not fire rockets just like their fellow struggles in the Gaza strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in shake and punish them should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the Hardliners will be able to go through, but the Arab spring could make them a stroke through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is greater than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local super power will hardly help the new Arab governments to maintain their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to reach a state of weapons could be a promiseful sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-termly.
While the rest of the Arab world takes careful steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to rob their self-decision rights - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only be worsening.
Bloody missions to withdraw the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a stroke from outside
The right answer is those represented by the reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two countries where Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the armed state will give outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt has to stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza strips and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the limits of 1967, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Very far away in the white house it seems like he's also rejecting a share.
But this is a regretful, short-looking perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging shall enter into force
Health warnings and diseased parts of the body on neutral green packages equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This will replace brand logs and colours with neutral, olive green covers, which are also printed with drastic pictures, showing sick parts of the body and sick smoking infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, printed in identical, smaller fonts is from the coming Saturday.
This will introduce Australia the most stringent system for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to bring young people away from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26 will no longer start smoking with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can see in children of young age that they understand the message of applying tobacco concerts with their brand picture," says Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that, for example, showed that children are associating the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a minor effect on the profits of multinational groups, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The Tabaclobby struggled hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would be favoured by the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre by British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falses will offer larger quantities of these products on Australia's roads.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have encouraged their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettetuis and silicone coverage has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed at the Upper Australian Court two months ago with their fight against the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and waited for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media with the precise population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them to enter as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to no longer interpret cigarettes in business. Now the tobacco advertising has been switched to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products, does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who finds so great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that it even takes up a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organization, although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has led conversations with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country for which photographic warnings were written in 2001.
In the meantime, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proud.
The pictures do not affect me.
I'm just ignored them.
"You just take a kippe and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the Inner City of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his rolls.
"I used an hour earlier to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told us all right, that was, we're closing," he clearly adds forest.
In a constantly electricized world it is nice to be tired even once
This thanksgiving spent indefinitely five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts too long.
I don't want to lie.
A half day waiting for a flight at the airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
However, more and more academics and child development experts are long enough to be positive.
When it goes after them, it's for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be tired.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thinking, which may promote creativity.
And since most of us stare almost constantly on the one or other screen today, the advantages of the long-looking things are no longer good for us.
So should we welcome the tragedy with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll get back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that longing is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing recreation.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, the patience has a very long story," he says.
The house walls Pompejis ceases a Latin grave fiti over Langeweile, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question how we really define Langweile.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, states that the problem is that longweeds have been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long lectures of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long enough is the experience of "a satisfactory activity but cannot be defined".
Unfortunately, apathy is different from the fact that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, there is no need to do something.
The key experience of the longweed, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with bad loneliness and the feeling that the time goes slowly."
Unfortunately, it can sound almost like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could be related, disadvantaged people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we only have difficulties to concentrate.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German: "The inactive understanding: The definition of long-terms under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the September magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science", pointed Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to an earlier experiment, listening to a band on which a person is presenting a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to it to low volume, so it was hardly perceiveable, while the third group did not at all understand these sounds.
The people who took the hardly hearable TV claimed to feel more long-term than the two other groups - they had problems with focusing, could not find any reason for them and wrote their difficulties in the long-term.
When you try to focus on a difficult or effortful task, the disturbance of attention can lead to longweile, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you exercise a single-tonish activity - "as the search for malicious products on a factory support band, music can deduce and help to not feel tired."
Actually, he says, we now know that crustaceans and crustles, often interpreted as signs of prolongedness, can even fight them by keeping people more physically aware.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hampel around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in silence," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a dry speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are boring more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala to prolongation".
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
As a result of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external travel.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents with a Pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the adults in the school and when doing the house tasks, while 23% claimed to be tired if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents claimed to feel tired.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages have risen or decreased as regards longweeds.
However, he is sure that "the youth is felt particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no significant influence on their daily course.
So back to my question of origin: Is Langweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because in an extreme case, it leads people to taking extreme physical risks and to lose the gambling or drugs to linder them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors explore the relationship between Langeweile and Creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the topic for more than two decades.
"The brain wants to say that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can provide for happiness in the short term, but these are refugees in the long term.
Thus, if you have enough iPad, you can get it from the long-term, but you have not learned to talk or control yourself, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Selve control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain but also to receive more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate longweeds.
We should also not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel us well, besides the constant activity and technology conservation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like it would have to be more boring for us. But longing is the awful, unpaid desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for one way, turning off and relaxing.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to occupy when the noise is stunned once."
There is no clear guideline in Colorado for the new Marihuana law
The 19-year-old Community College Student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the south-east Colorados for an infringement before court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana brocks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer Marihuana found in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drugs outdoors - cavalier defendants who each have been punished with a punishment of 100 US dollars - and received a judicial deadline.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the State to legalise small quantities of marijuana for their own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of infringements of order that turn around Marihuana are already dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer persecuting adults over 21 years of age for minor possession, which is legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force over the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative areas of Colorados have announced that they continue to pursue existing marijuana delicates and still quote people before court.
At the same time, several cities, from the pre-town Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, stately licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Police Manager in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington crawllessly on their heads.
They are waiting for a orientation aid for the establishment of a license system for the production, production, sale and sale of the drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado in any case is predicted by most countries as regards the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for its own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore the state is well suitable for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituosen in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone in which the State License System is not yet existing but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practical questions must be explained at this time - for example, how to agree the state standard of a "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Neverwhere it will be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently trained research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail in which he declared that the prosecutor would no longer persecute smaller marijuana duties in persons over 21 years, and that the police would "from now" no punishment for these infringements.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban requirements for the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and will continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorados, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 persons must be responsible for the ownership of about 50 grams or less of Marihuana before the court, although many were also charged for other debts.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements in which it was at the time of crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are twisted even in places such as the Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiatives.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District lawyer Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership procedures.
"I don't think I'm going to waste my time by using the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep-deep thread among local officials with regard to the large green experiment.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the prosecutors of marijuana laws and acts locally as a speaker of the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life in pursuing persons criminally that they are still unable to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries who treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for the legalisation of drugs.
While prosecutors and officials prepare for a age of legal sales, they also wait nervously for instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at federal level as criminal offences.
Advocates of the Legalisation Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several exciting arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultants of the Obama Government believe that although criminal officers are probably not going to enter any doors to capture smaller amounts of drugs, they are probably going to run to tolerated under the new legislation legal, stately regulated marijuana businesses.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the date of election, some local municipal administrations approved Moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban which is probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to guess in a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative change.
We are directing ourselves to what the community has decided and not to what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought to be the world's largest knowledge stamp, as a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry at Worscester College at the end of the eighty years - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bag again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard it said I had gone because I had a problem with the fact that Commissioners in the nearby room had sex.
The author A N Wilson explained schelmically that I had left the university because I was forced to drink out of damaged bags.
But the truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, run, because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my pretty unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
It seemed that I had only been disconned for one reason - a reason that was an important consultant of Margaret Thatchers and I was prosecutor of the Conservative Party in this claimable wave of lighting.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred on tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same protection of equality in the last week, which benefits from sulphur, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus College indicate that they are "isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted because of their political views".
They require a place in the Equalification Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
A recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", represented Tories as an excentrice and neonazis.
It showed, among other things, Absolvent Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a rolls-royce, with silver-coloured dress and silver-occupied Gehstock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "sound bucks for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing link trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without having ever met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, has observed a growing rejection against students of the conservative rights of JCR members.
"This presents a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shocked 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its highlight.
In the previous year, the university had voted for not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to reductions in high schools.
The atmosphere would even have made stalinists scared.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students meet and the tutors, I received a taste of future events.
I made the experience that the Tutors did not only tolerate the mocking of tory students, but even with joy.
Political topics such as mining workers' strike, privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the hollow-town rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and I hadn't been attached to what was supposed to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime died), "translate the first paragraph."
I stole with it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cooking, and quite hesitated.
"Rejecting Thatcher attachers to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students looked.
In my eyes, tears threw up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so, if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt grunted me.
I returned back to my room with hanging head.
That evening I sat at college alone at dinner when someone typed me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Everyone who is suspected to be Tory will be triumphed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semester suggests to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to move later.
I was insisting that I didn't have any opinion with Mrs. Thatcher at all.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A study beginner in the field of philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically visited the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was pervers and terrible.
"How's Tories sex?" asked me one.
They're hitting each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the liberaler legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the darkness is invaded?
Should I apply to the Labour Party and undermine my natural tendencies?
The three years in front of me, longed before my spiritual eye to a fire of agitation and isolation.
The only tutor who was openly recognized as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservator, but also because he had consulted Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rare.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smaller and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to pend between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more enclosed friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said timidly.
They would never do this, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my Communist friends always put good ways in the day.
His damp eyes grew.
Give the whole one a chance.
I'm sure you're just nailed.
It would break my heart if you went.
With my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory attachers, had given up the pressure and rejected his convictions.
During a tutorium next week, when another historical student seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Though I was in secret before shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "hearing laundry" and called her "old trottle".
The lighting just took a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the sarge of my Oxford carriage.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my horses left.
When they went, I packed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You'd like to call me a female squad.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such an intimidation and wickedness in a educational facility.
And more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Prime Ministers of Tory, but hid behind an unpaid reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of famousness"
At the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture" that was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemacher.
Somerset House, the former residency of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worth the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer when opening "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the skin Couture were composed, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconsistent Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without its different clients couldn't have been written.
Valentino always felt fascination for the sticky and remote world of the Adel.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until 3 March, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read Aristokrate, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest modemacher in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the Adel does not have to be of disadvantage.
"They don't put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as it does some beautiful fames from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of famousness.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemacher.
A lot of years ago, after a fashion view at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", which started their course at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes from the fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Mother View of the Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of concession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 metres long run, which suggests a rolling exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the run step to admire a dreamful "audienz", the masterpieces of Valentino wear, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a mantel of wool and leather, which was belonging to the emperor of Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion pops, names are like the names of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pocket, a shirt, a West type of "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift of him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I attract him to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Herzegovina of Feria.
I like the colours he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader at the fashion of Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time when she had a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my father, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a drowned top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, its occupation is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratin, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg preserves its evening clothes of the Modemacher "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress but also the related memories".
The "König" of the Mode
The big finish of the exhibition in Somerset House is the maritime dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modemacher called his nearby runs) were necessary to produce this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four and a half metres long sweep.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir être" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre of Art et des Lettres, excellent with the honoral delegation, cumulates Garavani as many honours as any of the husbands of his customers.
"I'm always his refinement, his rest, his careful and perfect expression noticed," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala evening at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the grave Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was unclean; the time leaves no trails to him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and their health when they carry 70 kg of sulphur over the steady, stone ways.
There are people for which their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by picking sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
To this end, he must rise down to the ground of his crater every day, where the soil-containing gas flowing from the earth is mounted in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the desolate paths of stone.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which raises up to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the shield speed, maintaining the balance and setting their steps carefully so that they do not screw out and crash.
You know that every step can cost their lives, as this happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steil hangs of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 Eurocent for each kilogram of sulphur that they degrade.
Upstairs, they run the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus cups and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometres to the scale, which has set a mine company a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has exploited the events in the volcano and (not better said) its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupies (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They will then sell it to the petrochemical industry for every 10.000 rupies (83 Eurocent) because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the production of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 Rupien (3,8 euros) for every way," Anto explains to us, who normally makes three lines a day.
For each route, he needs three hours that he has been completely successful, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupies (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, but is the threefold of what he would deserve with field work.
"The dayly son of mine workers here, where the coffee cultivated 15,000 rupies (1,2 euro) are paid on the day and the average monthly income is two million rupies (167 euro) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maur on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 Rupien (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hosting frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has played his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first tracks at him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glass.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hosting frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work here for two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but lively punished young man could work as a tourist leader, cellner, or to receive a hotel, but instead, he performs the work of a tragedy.
It divides a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers and stands up at two o'clock every morning, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color is blooming in the darkness.
The shadow challenges, he rises into the crater in the light of a little headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers are loading the basket with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its great gains, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur degradation to save costs, and delivers no equipment to the carriers who work on their own accounts and are paid by weight.
They will also not receive any share in the 30 000 rupies (2.5 Euro) supplements per photo apparatus, which the guards of this natural park, together with the entry money of 15,000 rupies (1.2 euro), demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protests Madrazine, a stable, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen since three decades.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and shines the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick pillars that rise up from the scratch, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blasts on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks through a goat path between the beach to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth widely, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder with his 30 years of age also works as sulphur trailer.
Time goes, but the poverty holds generation to generation in one of the hardest professions of the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame for having no children, career, stress and costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizen's duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbonbons, but still - or just that's why - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local vocals such as "Schieving will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who turned the video, retains the hope that the advertising spot reaches funny ways to make attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In reproduction, we are the worst of the world, so we noticed that this is a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromons or the organization of Speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not forced to success.
We therefore thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this topic easy are Singapore's government.
Every year, she spends $1.300 for political action to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-technological state in south-east Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national public authority, says that this is due to "be better education" and "greater career bills".
"This has enabled people to marry and form a family to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the delays of marriages and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
However, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to consents in the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where the hardly cheated Xenophobia flows against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result last year since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
This is how it already affects the housing market.
The urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales result.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the one alone, and that they disturb the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units of living.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer directions that were previously obstructed barriers if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could lead to an increase in national birth rates, the discussions with the Singaporens working in the financial district should be made that they will not have a significant effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their career, stress and costs for property and education as a reason for their absence of children.
That is why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can still do so much.
The offline Private is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "one area of private life, where you have the right to protect from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its everyday and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces if he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years of age, which are frequently on the network.
In four cases, they linked the term "something very own" at personal level and "to the password and the user" when applying it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't tell in a mail," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know her, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'll also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not from me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write whether photos, necks, crimes or violent or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up with Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just let it up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertainable, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or to friends" he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown one.
Even if someone recommends him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits that he does not know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has made his breath or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or demands it from me, I just remove it from my user account," he admits.
José reported at Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The friend's familiarity was pressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Afterwards, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of known people in uncomfortable or pleasant situations.
Yes, I would do that if he was insane or I wanted to wipe him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a high school graduation in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and youths, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networking.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the Academy Marc Prensky, the owner of a master title in education at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion about what should be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective when it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is to ask them questions that bring them to thought.
"To tell you they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porra then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why then do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question, do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Everyone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and teacher, comments that it is essential that parents read the social network directives carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
End of the Summit of the Unasury without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The Sixth Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration that was previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasury. Sources in the State and Presidential Office first informed that they would transmit it after the clause, however, then explained that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruese Government.
In the case of questions about the text, they indicated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the unasured governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruese press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which led to unpleasant discomfort in the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media that demanded more information.
Afterwards, the President-in-Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "declaration" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was a host of the III. Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even at this opportunity, despite the press's strong call, the so-called Lima declaration was published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can convince that the document was published on the last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruese authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were present, but to a high extent they restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of Den Haag, which is engaged in a cross-border conflict between two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in Den Haag, in the process of entering the Lima against Santiago to listen to the plans of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counter.
"Chile was, is and continues to be a country that follows international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and is subject to international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a hand pressure before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the IGH was made after Columbia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, who considered it a serious mistake, had raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the disaster since 2011 after the suspension of his President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and finished the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State leaves the final document in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He noted that measures would be forwarded to "to improve cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in the cities and against organised cross-border crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production performance and to show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus to unite our countries and establish new economic forms," said the Peruese President in a readable statement.
Among these projects, five Peruans would be located on the cross-axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give any further details.
Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves for its re-inclusion in the Union of South American nations," which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relationships was another aspect that was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the beginning of his participation in the regional meeting, said that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his congress of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal with the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH in question.
"I may be going to meet the President Daniel Ortega on Saturday tomorrow," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions necessary with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present in the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, in which dialogue and consensus regarding the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the chair at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereas "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts and are now practically a fatherland.
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of the disaster.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andes Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
President Ecuador also welcomed the redesignation of the organisation of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Angels' Saxony States and to take into account those signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach, never commit themselves to anything, and in turn, we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is impossible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an example of the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray its principles, but did comply with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were "reasoned suspects that Assange would deliver to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish justice, which he demanded to submit to him in his country to an inquiry for a claimed sexual defect, while "the Swedish judicial rule allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out on Ecuador's message in London."
Correa explained that the danger is that the health and psychic condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious thing," said the Head of State of State Ecuador.
However, it is the risk that he can cause physical and psychic damage because he is caught in a close space and could not carry out physical exercises in the outside.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, the Assange has been awarded in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June, is a free letter to allow him to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the jurisdiction authorities of Europe. He stressed that there were discussions with London to find a solution for the locked founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European instances," he explained.
And "If the United Kingdom gives this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr Assange on Ecuador's message in London or over Skype, how the Swedish law has been allowed and in other cases, the problem should be resolved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defendant of the freedom of press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediumness, the evil intents and the lie that defends the free expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who are pursuing and expressing profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador no longer will be dominated by such journalists "and not be dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spiesburgerly countries," and took advantage of the revelation of "the revolution will deepen in order to continue the way into this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next elections, arguing that the organism must remain "hart and no opportunism and no one can take place as a legally dressed state" because thereby "the legitimacy of democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
President Ecuador also considers the wish of his columbian contributor, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which proclaimed Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate the maritime borders between two countries, "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be handled comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international instances when both countries are obliged to adopt the judgment even if it is very hard to do."
As regards the possibility that he would make himself a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate as a result, he claimed that he would "see this possibility with much optimism and joy, although it sometimes falls very hard."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally been interested in me, but under the injustices of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I had to win, it would be my last period as President, and then I'll withdraw from the public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"It's determined," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just talking to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he had traveled for a planned routine treatment there, and that he would expect him to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean a fall in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the ecuadorian Head of State took part in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
A cause of death for AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the study result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he said about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "degrade" without noticeable success.
He hid it before his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such an effort that he just celebrate his 43th birthday.
He is doubtless one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS' clinic failed to adopt, "because it led into a sackgasse."
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and with which the virus has already damaged and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "this great success today means that the survival of a patient taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a viewed scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death condemned, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impaired immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater possibilities that are not drug dependent on: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years at a counting of 500 CD4.
Simplifiedly, the above statements mean that whoever receives HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, in this sense, can become "problemlessly 75 years old as long as he is under control", this expert explained.
In order to correctly arrange this progress, it must be reminded that today's life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years.
Even though death has decreased significantly over the past years (in Mexico, the number of people dying in AIDS has been reduced from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA’s annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of patients included in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year there are 187 deaths; however, there has been guaranteed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
So why do people still die of it?
- I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least over the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Now out of ten patients come to us if they already have a co-infectant infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnostics are required, so all people in which this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (the State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also with the patients such as Fabrizio who were able to carry out his test at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerous tumour), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they'll die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather place three times," I say.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sport and take the medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, entertain a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his witness those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should make the test when they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
Between the health programmes and the simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV, explains great holes.
And the most important thing is the prevention.
In the particular places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risks of new infections include young people.
"What do you need to do?" is a widespread question of social workers, oriental staff in schools, employees in pharmacists and in the health system that youths do not want to expose, insured the correspondent.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the shop table but in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiscuity.
It is not supposed to be paid to them the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question whether it would be distributed preservative under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like that; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already perform a sexual activity," he pointed it.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen at the 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th in relation to HIV.
92% of seizures occur in sex, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50 000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people not known for each registered case.
After the United States Appeal Court has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the obligations of the Vitro Group, which were achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a disadvantaged precedent will be created for each national company with residential establishments in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for survival of the companies which allow the Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of the stars and stripes in contradictory to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the North District of Texas on 15 June leads to the unnecessary exposure of the Mexican companies to their possession outside the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico's door and gate to call on the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case indicates that the believers must be subject to the United States' bankruptcy law, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans first states that the main procedure is the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity of payments by companies with a cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the harmonization of international trade law, with the American Law Institute as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy of the branches of Vitro with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was authorised.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose obligations were confirmed among companies of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercanties (Bundes Institute for Trade Concurses).
It is also true that after deducting the voices of the branches, the believers of Vitro, who complained against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which led to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family contradicts the same court in order to vote in the plenary, i.e. by all judges because only three of them voted.
In the absence of this, the Cercioire inquiry, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher instance, will be invoked by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious thing in this case is that the Court has given a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcy, and in which it is pointed out that it was strictly attained to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with the chapter 15 of the United States' bankruptcy law.
In addition, it is noted that the country has undergone the principles of international trade by the Commission of the United Nations, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border incapacity guaranteeing equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertising by the Mexican air traffic union against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (American Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is subject to the disability of justice.
Afterwards, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic’s principal administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove 198 million pesos from Bank IXE’s trust account from the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrative Profesional de Hotels (Professional Hotel Management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we talk about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplemented to a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the past, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate's request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English shortage of ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Own.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because he viewed them as an infringement of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex carriage certificates brings more than 500 million pesos on the market.
The emissions are the first of four similar emissions, which promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Creation of Competival
A group of companies was founded by NYCE, e-quality and core, leading companies of information technology, under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, as a player of lower classes, players of the first national League, officer and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"I have set many hats in the basketball for my life, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when I visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not excessive with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and prove them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-business leader or manager of the club.
"That was my best years I've enjoyed most, because I have been allowed to be part of eight masterships of Vaqueros since 1967 as manager, co-worker or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted myself with a mastership in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and attended at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico ever.
Bartow then recommended the Raymond Gaussist, who was a citizen and one of our best advertisers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was given to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he proposed to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when for the first time we won the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then, in 1990, the World Championship, where we set the fourth place, what should actually be bronze if not had been this Canadian violent judge who gave us the last tour for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of world championship in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympia 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite is, however, the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the United States team, as then when they won against us at the world championship of Bronze.
At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who couldn't be there for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personality, but with which we won a gold medal and made us great joy was those of the 1995 pre-olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitin as a replacement for the locked players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as Piculín at this level.
And this, without taking into account his course in the various bodies in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN from the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I had introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That, for example, the boys in Ponce only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrary judges.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go down and go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the "Dallas" television series, where he played a unreasonable, delicious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series was a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new valley of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth town, Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest thanks.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived life in full moves," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had drowned a lot over years.
In 1995 a bad tumour was detected in his liver, and he was subject to a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice guy in the TV in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" at the TV Institute NBC.
There he played the Astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he hit an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also a publisher of two commodities, which were exposed only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
As part of his cinema work, the critics included well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the magnificent awesome J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the TV chain CBS on the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was exposed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann’s figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were used in competition houses.
So the series reached a viewer record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who transformed "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment programme since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sweater of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had swallowed her and threatened to represent her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, unsatisfactory man with a charismatic smile: a deceived businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to give his alcoholicly ill wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the grave stone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honourable citizens of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-worker of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and inheritable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts to keep us who have the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second stack was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the transmitter.
From Warner or by TNT there was no immediate explanation about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, the classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a young man when she received Larry with lawyer Ben Hagman during her marriage.
He tried his happiness on the theatre stages in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, afterwards he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California City of Malibu, where many famousities have their seat.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I haven't written anything of which I thought it could hurt someone or interfere with him in any wise manner," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he set himself for liver donors and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are before and thereafter," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable for the first time, but it's gonna be good to you."
He also rejected smoking and took part in several campaigns.
The start of the course that studys the "Ende of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and Keime, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to keep a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistent fishing hake: the end of the "long back counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should expect him in the following two months: the destructive Hurrican Sandy, which some called "Deudarmagedon", as well as a growing conflict with Israel's participation, the place where Christian theoretics believe that the Apokalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever there," Charmé said this week the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who's supposed to be the last in history to offer courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, the assistant professor Barry Beautiful gives the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and Keime, and global warming.
"We analyse, why these ideas spread with time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to the real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, believable and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a assistant professor of art history and anthropology, created a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we always keep the option to retain the course, for the case that the world does not fall under," Restall said.
Despite the "existing submission" students need to study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination is carried out in the evening of the Apokalypse, why the students have no other chance of "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with a high average filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails from students who asked if there were places available for weeks before the semester start.
The students, on their own, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Chambers for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious intelligence is actually only a question of comfort or lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nurse declared that he had seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard anything about a lesson where this is being taught," he indicated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students asked - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project was dealing with Mayas' prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in the western society, which results in several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who instructs the Philippines this year, answers quickly to the question whether he would know a course about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an inhalation on an exception to a higher instance.
We've got a contempt of the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophered that the 21st December of the beginning of a seven-year period, the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several people said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
