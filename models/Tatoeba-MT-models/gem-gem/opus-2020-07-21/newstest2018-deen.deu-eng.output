Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
A miserable arrival where youths are to meet today.
A crop chapel that is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleing gardens manage the intrinsic ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's nervous when maps are not up to date.
This is what everyone knows who had to rain up once because the car Navi instead of a round road showed a green wheat.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, a offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are all other than current - but just because of this very exciting.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flicket deck that is not recognized as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps, called original leaves, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bayerian Measurement Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and the first of Bayern's Measurement.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bayern with Austria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops eventually declined with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it were the neighbors today who created the idea of a surface-through Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerian Measurement Management.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is found as all others on the site of the Bayerian National Library.
The comparison Earlier/Today is the most definite example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is sub-sender, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sending was emigrated 21 years after making the map, that is, 1877, as Munichner City Part.
Today, subsendant is located in the middle of the city.
In 1856, the houses undersendlings focused along the today's Plinganser Road, named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the revolution of the Bayerian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today the West Park is, you can see nothing but fields - on the first view: When you zoom in, a smaller map appears with a dozen lines and numbers: manually numbered passages from the so-called "uptake", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer there any farmers there today - but clay farmers of the plant "Land in the sun".
A large green area is marked north of subsendment.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the October festival, has actually been a wheat - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other hand of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen is not only read the street names "am Gasteig" or from the altitude "Up the Lifts" - but also in large letters "Errn Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeld road, people were once locked in with mistress.
In 1858/59 the Münchner Circle Irrenanstalt "Up the Eye Lifts" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard led by Godden the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chains of the so-called mistakes.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the museum Haidhausen, who has worked with an exhibition.
For 280 patients, there was first space, later increased to 500 places.
At some time, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit centre in the hair in 1905.
The isar-Amper clinic München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany, has been located since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
Westernly, the football site of TSV Munich East, eastern housing from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural reconstruction to the origin of the Irrenic Institute, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in Bomben attacks.
The Marienplatz was named "Maupt Place" in 1856, called "Koperinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Alliated rose many holes into the city of the Inner City.
A big one stayed at the Marienhof until today.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Mediterranean crop chapel were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparing work and the Spatenstick on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn stamp line.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared to the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group published Travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is intended to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention when traveling through the State and to guardians of extreme caution, since a number of questionable, race-based events have occurred in the last time in the whole state and are noted here," says the group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal persecution authorities of the State, which disproportionately aimed at minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"You have infringements of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are merged or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear anxiety in such a frequency as we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist infringements against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during the journey by the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Office of Missouri's State Prosecutor, which shows that black drivers in the state are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be ready to bring cash or let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri reported 100 hatred crimes, after the latest figures from the Hatred Crime Report of the FBI, which graduate the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain about a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws, the local criminal persecution authorities had undertaken to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiles.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU Federal Day Members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on site.
At the Swidemann family courtyard, representatives of the Fisherbach CDU site association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Mark Schwendemann first provided insights in his operation where he manages 55 hectares of wheat and 40 hectares of forests, provides 40 milk cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "swordswild milk" is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, says Swindemann.
The vacation guests' table comes only regionally.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "elementar important".
I can't profit in such stray areas.
The greenland surface provides a lot of work, many things must be processed with the engine sensor.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Wendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and manages it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he does not conduct a biooperative operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader support."
Agriculture needs to be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the exploration of the areas could be drawn out for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation," the Mayor stressed.
Farmers are often in criticism because of support
In 2013, 25 parcels of 11 participants were collected in total.
The open-keeping area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be formed until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half was funded over Leader, a quarter was the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of weed.
"The great advantage is the long life of the teeth," said Wendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers' women."
Peter White also said: "Here are best food produced."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote weeds.
The goal is the openkeeping of the Black Forest.
The condition is the existence of a funding coal referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the intake area must not be trailable (changing more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the explosion.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently made by eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build almost 16 kilometres of coat.
The open-label area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the freedom statue
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully sceniced Sturz of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic ass in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President on drastic restriction of legal immigration to the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have hit him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta offended: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the freedom statue is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original freedom statue."
Miller is right, but as he himself made it, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance on the upholsterous words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poor's poorest: "Your tireds, your arms, / your troubled masses that desire to breathe freely, / the evil waste of your rich coast."
There was never a time in which the "every waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who used to put their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the relations between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embarrassment of freedom in a classical abuse.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a different name: Mother of Exilants.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wings for a long time.
The big rope hall Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the arrival of Trump, argued in 2010 that the freedom statue is rather a early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It is intended to carry the fackel of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The fackel should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Similarly unusually, Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the perception position.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, evil, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travels on the decks of ships.
It is in the realest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And of course, that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their fack shall not illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two shots were the team of Britain
The performance director of the United Kingdom's Leichtathletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the world championship framework will "a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "he has to develop something special in Scotland" and the light athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll carry it on until we find it out," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Leichtathletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medaills, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be approached against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh put in, of course, was great."
The commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join her fifth world championships at the 400 m obstacles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British team.
Schottland has hitherto been the best total number of athletes in the world championship, seven who have been reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir's middle runner runs this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1500 m, is another shot to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other shot in Lee McConnell was.
The captain of the team says that it is "enormely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only a team, but in some cases also joining the medals and the finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Of course I am very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on podies.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are again in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not apply to a public office if you cannot accept the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it took not long until the newspapers hit him for everything from internal policy to his political principles.
He swallowed in criticism, sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to silence.
For in 1783, Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employee has blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week's beginning.
The staff of the governor released the complaint as freely, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electoral and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially called and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the Peitsche online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Law lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hatred crime.
"I commented honestly that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news message "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor employees called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "for language".
The Facebook Era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles, or arrest demonstrators, and bring them to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for his discouragement with Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged with Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter-feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Louououn County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers attacked his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolles.
The people who used pseudonomies such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Speaking freedom, disagreement and discourse are part of our nation's foundation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoped for domestic comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led next to the Archerfield Links in the last year before losing Paul Eales, is connected with the new place of excursion and functions as tournament messenger on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reaches his fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous prosecutor of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since she was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf games.
The memories from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home floors.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how it has gone."
With the Trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Capitän Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an insasse and £10 per car with two or more insasses.
All sales go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Lower lung cancer steam by passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died for passive smoking in lung cancer.
This results in a study of scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"After our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he went to a own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove very complex
The construction work in the Villinger street is in full walks and "lending somehow in time," says the leader of Fred Heinze.
In the field of household connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since much is hidden in the underground, which is not labelled in the plans.
The transport, which is constantly obstructing the construction work, represents a major problem for the company Stumpp's construction team.
"The ignore of the drivers against red amples and locking grids is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were very hard to do.
But happily, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold
When Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a flock.
She uses a pot even rarely.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewoman usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the chain.
After half an hour, the cold knee is taken and swallowed with thin, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the leather - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash clothes with dirty water from the nearby sump.
A butter in a dawn room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drinks hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the high country of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken into account in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders should vote by a public recording before the crew troops.
An existing movement that affected the independence of Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, whereas the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as far as it is destiny. It includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the car rental.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo beans, and of wave sheets transformed by rose into different yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, then sweep journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wear this clothes," says Degei, indicating on her lively, handwoven Turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"We had only leaves on our bodies before."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty border and have some of the worst children's mortality and alphabetisation rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has degraded 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a disturbing presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military members and units almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated unpleasantly.
According to activists, more than 5000,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass mortality in Papua's tribe shochland in the 1970s, according to the Asian People's Rights Commission, became a people's murder.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report of the Erzdiözese Brisbane from the year 2016, in which reports of greeds of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims since every week events occur," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring a stream of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83% Christian, but demographic development changes, as Muslim economic immigrants come from the population islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warning Cantines sell brown chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable with earthnut sauce served.
Local people struggle to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to work in the province capital Jayapura.
"It cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian state president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with the inequalities and infringements in Papua during his election campaign 2014.
The former roomman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, a little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says you.
In fact, only two months after Jokowis's dedication in October, Paniai suffered a deep point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a stock fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn their lights on.
One of the soldiers took her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and hit the group with their gun collars, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football site before the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bowls and carried the waita dance - running in the circle and a bird song imitating - by Papua's Mee Pago stem.
Some demonstrators began to swallow stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses are more than three times resisting, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto Viertel of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and urged the amount to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left handgel," he said TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the balls came from the series of the soldiers collected here.
"It was filled, many shots were fired," he added.
The indigenous man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it," said Yohanes, who has as many Indonesians only a name that TIME in darkness.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The leader of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrations were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the deaths came to Jakarta only on the next day, 'filtered'.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to deal with the historical errors in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an outright mechanism for the inclusion of historical human rights infringements.
But the explanations started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early in the 2000s.
The point is that we are obliged to deal with these infringements, but there are processes that need to run through," he said.
Weanto then took a withdrawal when he spoke to Jakarta with TIME on June 5, and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legally regulated," he said.
Weanto, who has accused the UN of "criminality against humanity", which demanded more than 1,000 death victims in East Timors' bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights infringements have already been incorporated in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai sacrifices accepted such claims with grievous disbelievance.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was struck by the military after he helped buried four of the victims.
"When I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Reared villagers protested before the company’s location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by fireing warns.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting on the crowd and killing one.
"We were so paniced, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed as the injured were quickly submitted here, so the TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai parliament called on to take the officers involved to account and to withdraw the police's mobile Brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a disruption for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the family members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the Rebel Army, who claims to defend Papua's rights by entering sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and willingly maintained, under the predecession of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never appear again.
Among the people in Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for residents.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are cultivating everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 100,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived at a larger number since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and richer migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary capabilities to conduct its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribe Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, limitations on reporting remain stressed on international media.
In the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the vice-president Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis's electoral struggle have not been realized to remove the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's most distressed eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the United Nations Human Rights Council to examine the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua, including Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's claims and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to distort the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to note this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, the locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the Chamber of Tribunal.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from the constant threat of a robberian military, the Paniai population is in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Yokowi as a "shell" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooting victims made a last symbolic act of defence: the body of a victim was buried in a field precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not let the responsible people forget about their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with sinked head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
A fire found in one of the world's highest towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 metres high, 79-stop buildings.
It is the second fire that feasts through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch tower (Fackel tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We've been sleeping and we've been raised at the fire alarm and in the crying of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," Reuters told a resident who claimed his name as George.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4 p.m. at the time of the place (00.00 p.m. GMT) waste the fire and cool the building.
The government said they were working on the provision of accommodations to the stakeholders.
The incident can resurrect questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage from the clothing, the outer clothing to decoration or isolation, came.
In Great Britain, the police said that she believes that the system of plates for isolation and clothing could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June, where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through with his great Davis-cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup single was not supported by the required two-third multi-pop.
The often very long, but also very estimated five-sats classes are therefore still receiving the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, the objective of the ITF president David Haggerty was therefore only hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our Member States have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work on improving the applications.
After many contemplations, not only the vote had come before the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 is only relatively smaller details: Thus, the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host law in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements in the fields of training are facilitated, etc. and the players will have to take less official media conservation before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travellers brings prohibited items into the aircraft, finds a survey
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously forbidden items were smuggled over at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they carried accidentally prohibited knives or other items with cling.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered lately that they were inaccurately driven with shot weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers are rather disregarding the rules.
Of the respondents who confessed that they have knownly tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millions, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of generation X.
The most frequent items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent confessed that it was obvious to have carried items with cling through security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling products would have brought through the airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is not surprising that the people who are most frequently flying - scientifically or unwise - are carrying through the security.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain, which fluids they can take or how much of it.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest amount of products confisked by the TSA is prohibited.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggleware.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Ten thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk's electric-tausendsassa Elon Musk is pleased to specify with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far noted that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unobligatory reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time declared another, less glanceful number in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often been bought with the more than 500.000 pre-order orders for the new car in the last few months, whose delivery is just starting.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Criteria have repeatedly pointed out that it is only unobligatory reservations.
In a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the United States 1000 dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
At present, 450,000 such unobligatory reservations were made, Musk entered a telephone conference with analyzers.
However, the Tesla-Chef does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambiguous growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it is supposed to be - all models collected - 5000,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone ordering a "model 3" today may expect the delivery at first in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla can drive its new, never tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent inadequate customers from running away in crowds.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions
One day after he had been complained by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Authority, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama Era in order to reduce the emissions of susceptible air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency demonstrated the needs of the public environmental authorities to reaction faster than the past administrations.
He did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his former office in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline for States on 1 October to comply with the standards of 2015 for land-nahes ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing into local decisions or obstructing economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a state prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly overlooked blocking or delaying regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal return for Pruitt's regulatorial rollback agents.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanelecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turning in ozone standards simply strengthen the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of proper compliance with the new standards.
"In former administrations, the EPA often did not comply with the deadlines for implementing and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date of implementation," said Pruitt, who complained more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have to take seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt will at any time use its "sensitive powers and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had complained the EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by Smog, who flow in their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refinery, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The arriving Smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental guards rejoiced about Pruitt's surprising exchange of courses.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crossing of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental pollutants and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius-Kirche
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 p.m.
Whether his idyllical location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be decorated by this powerful place.
The salvation and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of tolls their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique fateful little dog."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Capelle was for the first time mentioned in Württemberg's Authentic Book: Graf Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the Pfarrkirche to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
The words of the explanation were on the Tumlinger Mountain, except for the former priesthood church, also a glorious court to which the church or patronate law belonged and not reversed.
So there were people there too.
As the description of the Upper Office of 1858 shows, next to the subdorf and the Oberdorf, which are currently to be recognized in the local image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the glorious settlement corn of the village.
Old maps from time around 1600 will support these historical conditions.
The law of the cartridge consisted of the right of the early age of the church of the church.
A gentleman who built a church, provided and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This was linked to the right to advocate a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broken on Christmas in 1673.
The newly purchased watch then told for the first time in 1692, but later in the Second World War, in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were hit and the bells were stolen.
The roof was nothing.
In 1796, French troops were stored near the church.
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as burning wood.
The rest of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing sweaters.
In 1823 the Friedhof was expanded and the Hilarius Church was discontinued.
Only the Kirchturm was left to stand.
In the New Year Night of 1834, a storm split the Kirchturm and half crashed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was interrupted.
Only the tower that is still present today remained given as a witness to the 750 - year - old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Safe Rentners" as a follower of Dieter Dockhorn, the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen are invited on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade to the old Friedhof to the St. Hilarius Capelle.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler gymnasium Joyal City and with words from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader, Hartmut Romann, speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Introduction is at 15.30 p.m.
The Serenade's voice is a drown in front of the cemetery.
"Now a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view of wheat to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only on dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tolls and hearing widows.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel specially obliged to the home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to verify the approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim is fighting" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim fights" called for Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer net.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the date of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheim's net, no wind power plant could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind-energy plants are essentially possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in exclusion of wind-energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from "sparing".
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in Boisheim's net, a few days earlier by changing the surface use plan, which had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of the right of planning, the granted approval decision remains illegal and therefore also withdraws," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim fights".
Current state of things: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer net before the summer break; a district government approval is still out.
Recognise: "This will exclude the granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind-energy plants in this place."
The circle confirms the incoming of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the Fouren circle since last week," explained one speaker.
The circle takes it in order to review the matter again.
However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.
With a view to running procedures at the administrative court, the circle did not wish to comment on the argumentation of the Association "Boisheim confronts himself".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plants on a surface on the Boisheim net the construction of four per 200 metres high wind wheels.
Since last year, the company in which the city of Fouren is instantly involved had concluded cargo contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large terrain.
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants, it will be possible to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - which corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich bei Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind-energy plant in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collapse: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday's day at 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was deadly hurt.
Two more people were easily injured.
The country road remained locked over hours.
According to police statements, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took the L 333 to Bogel with her car in the context of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealer plan "Homeshops" weekly
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the Inner City in September.
The business association and the city management want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping pool into the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Business Association, Christian King, announced, the "Home-Shopping" week is intended to sensitise the customers for what offers the city holds alongside the usual supermarket wars.
It is therefore planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops in the city of the Inner City are to invite to the midnight hops.
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertising spots are in the radio, a Internet video and printed bags, which point to the end of the week of action, says Christian King.
City management and trade associations cooperate with the industrial and commercial chamber.
Thus, the business association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Innenstadt".
These include new offers such as the first "Activity Day" to the spring festival as well as sales-off Sunday, conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be renewed or relocked.
These include Kurgästs and tourists.
But many indigenous people would also have lost the city of the Inner City when shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to living the city of the Inner City - to renters, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It would have been possible to overcome the lathargy, which was partly widening, with a network, the king had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "Home hops" day on the bottom, for the first time five Thüringer cities participate.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sommerda, Holy City and Bleicherode.
The day was to "advocate more for the appreciation of local trade and its significance for our cities' common well," says Streich.
The action under the IHK's leadership and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with its purchasing behaviour can influence its direct environment itself.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
At a gas explosion in the US City of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been hurt, some of them are difficult.
According to the fire weather, on Wednesday (local time) was another injury in critical condition.
One man died when a part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
A first loser was also dead later.
The dead were an employee of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected to work on a gas pipeline.
At vacation time, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump made pressure for the payment of border walls by telephone calls in Mexico
Transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on a telephone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the U.S. warned him because he had publicly popped up the wall. According to reports he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States and swore to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "incredible", "mys" and "dummy" and that the existence of the trade that Obama's government would make it look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on relocation of refugees into the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massaker: Activists redirect racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and robbed into the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the mobs - a man of middle age in a needle strip dress - took a long train on his cigarette and looked under review through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates swept in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" cried the man.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Screw the silence when a young black man was crushed by the bike seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a resignation.
But when then a strike is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of us were pouring out very real saucers in the audience.
Since 2005, citizens' lawyers come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were beaten by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is truly unacceptable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the reconciliation.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old congress member of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil lawyer.
It serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A judicial doctor puts a bed towel on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although suspiciouss have been on free foot for decades, citizens' lawyers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-voice battle in summer.
Approximately at the same time as the choice, according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white base owner, Barnett Hester, defeated during a struggle - claimed for a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she had wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white country owner, paid 600 dollars to release Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they then took away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," it concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a complot between state and local criminal persecution, which was not only involved in murders, removed evidence and destroyed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks still forms it more prominent.
"It was an electoral Massaker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual post of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is obvious, graspful and is justified in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it is no longer in America.
It's hard to look, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch, because then we are faced with its witchness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done."
The samples for this year’s production started in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - were in a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role never becomes easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return at these times."
On the other hand of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who crys to Hester and presses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs at the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think white people said a --- he said."
"But," one of the other black makers whispered.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of companionship replaces unpleasantness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and stressed.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repeat ends violent and fast.
There are screaming, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a sad dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays sad lobred "Strange Fruit".
Their voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple are upset from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just coming down the road.
They have experienced almost eight hours of humidity in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrim trip to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anekdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels excited.
When the last notes of the song climb out, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspecte the body name.
Children hang on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the Lynchseil away and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the dress that played the Clansmith.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms crying, the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this isn't in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later, the audience is sitting together with the actors for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta prudent about the posting with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that have left the performance.
"It is difficult to hear these terrible words and acts ... from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What that really does to me makes me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds on his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The reproduction is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's the way if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"Guddammation" reconciled the wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets on a bunt-frivol scenario in front of gigantic, six-six-six-six-six-covered scenarios.
The turning stage (designed by Alexandr Denic) shows optionally a sharp street corner as well as wallrest and Danerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-old-hour parks where the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil vessels recall Castorf's lead motive - money, power and greed - which is attracted by its "ring" incentive.
The three Rhine daughters - sang by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess leads Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaks a body into the suitcase room in Hollywood Manier and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the glorious feet, surrounded by the aura of a gravity boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe.
The audience thanks it for the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormically celebrates Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who humbles and shapes the hands to Merkel-Raute.
There is a great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on the stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in army leisure clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his government team was expected with tension.
If he had had to have a silent pepper concert over himself in 2013, five years later there was a great jubilee in which the single "buh" calls went under.
Championship chief Katharina Wagner must have enjoyed it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has made not only one form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown a understanding of its visibility.
I'll draw a positive resume.
Max Quantity works as volunteer
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school in the open full day.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with youths, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years now, so you're a late-occupied volunteer.
How does that happen?
Quantity: I made abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on site, perhaps at the point of focus.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in the social sector in the winter semester.
I'm going to study twice, I'm probably doing a social worker training in the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Experts.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of use during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's always about where to make his FSJ.
You can make it from age home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very different from me.
I was also part of the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Surely, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people who have a very different story behind each one.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been picked out of the family - you must always address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching anxiety?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that is a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividends to resurrect the business
The British Educational Group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce their intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company faces.
The degradation of the jobs, mainly announced by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds (394 million US pounds) in order to restore a business that was taken by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, who had sold his participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the prospect for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year a growth of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato salad killed in suicide
A suicide killer has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the NATO and hurt several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter had been injured, shared a statement of the Nato.
According to uncertified local reports, three civilians died in the event in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violent act that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In an opinion by the Nato, the explosion was done on Thursday evening when a common patrouille with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised blowing rate" carried by individuals.
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable condition and are treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1.662 civil death victims, of which about 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide-auto bomb killed at least 30 people in a principal Shitic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had run this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country since the U.S. armies in 2001 expelled the Taliban from power.
The violence underlines the precarious safety situation in Afghanistan, as US president Donald Trump considers to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in Kabul, in recent weeks, suicide assaults have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policy, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog rules by complaints
The U.S. Environmental Authority has decided to delay the regulation of the Obama Government that the States are obliged to reduce the Smog-inducing emissions. This happened a day after 15 states complained the Agency for the step.
The EPA later announced on Wednesday the decision to move forward the "Ozone provisions 2015" and said to show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and because we respond to our government partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to measure the ozone regulations - in which to measure pollutants emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with more stringent air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to encourage economic growth according to Trump.
The efforts, however, have led to the relapse of the Democrats and Natural Protection Groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air, which contains ozone, can "reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
Council of Municipalities wishes Community area
At the end, the decision was clear: at two contradictions, the municipality Council of Fluorn-Winzels decides to establish a Community area in the future senior residential facility.
There is an important information before the discussion: the purchase contract for the missing part is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area of the churches is in the community's possession, there is no planned barrier for the project to be voted by a private investor now.
There is a debate on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
In the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Board of Municipalities are in favour of not just to see such a Community area as a meeting point for the residents of the senior right of residence, but openly in the municipality.
For example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has been taken by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn, will be disappeared by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area, reports Tjaden, would be eligible by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision to signal the investor that in this respect you do not want to throw him a knob between the legs, suggests that both satle - which is engaged in the environment - and Pultdach - what would reduce the level of progress and make the construction more economically possible.
Unnecessary, so Wilfried Sohmer doesn't just mean that addition.
If it helps, it's unanimously happening to the body.
It is not so easy for the Community.
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings with which you do not come so straight forward, for this one is now rejected from the Community room, she says, "I do hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is decisively speaking for the Community area, but absolutely against local participation.
It looks behind a hidden subsidy to outstanding investors or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not grant any grant, but will receive a fair, in doubt marketable value, is the objection.
Staiger's request to split the decision proposal accordingly finds three beneficiarys.
So it remains in two contradictors of the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we make the decision like this, we take a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is swallowed on the road
During the crossing of the street, a 82-year-old bike has been covered by a car on Wednesday in Garath and has been severely injured.
As the police announced, the 82-year Langenfelder was on the way from Hilden at 12.20 a.m. with his bicycle on the road to the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road At Buchholzer Busch.
A driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the long fields went to the road, however, he apparently did not care for the counter-course.
He collapsed with a car that managed a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was swallowed on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought with a rescue car to a hospital.
FC Bayern Munich has to leave the supercup against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game be cleaned against Dortmund.
With personnel care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first duty game of the new season.
Seven professionals miss the title defense in the supercup against the pokal winner.
The staff cares at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to miss David Alaba in the duell with the BVB.
That confirmed the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munichner Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeat in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualitys.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligent," said Ancelotti, who expects a "black, intense game".
The duel of the two German football swerweights draws the fans in their ban.
The lot is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football Liga (DFL) shared on Friday.
Walk in the harz from star to star
In the harz, the first "star path" is to be created.
This plants the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information of many hard visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up the planned route tables and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plants "gut accessible installations at five to six places" in the upper harz.
Inquiry would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegit and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receiver plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path train is to be expanded around the train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines more than another, although it was far further away.
It will also be conveyed in which star image a chosen star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the association has operated in the St. Andreasberg mountain town in the northern Germany highest place.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Natural Protection.
Often from there, the dairy road and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly seen with only eye.
In the Uni-Stadt, there has been something similar to the planned star yard – the planetary path – on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen.
At the beginning of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet's path leads up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as a "outerground" location in Diemarden (common equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stables with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the endpoint of the dwarf planet - are precisely set in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth so shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's road is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stable with Pluto.
So footfarers are faster than the light in the world's room.
The march to the next fast star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaakko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomaakko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to focus on the most exciting box struggle in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the uncoated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the Flur to welcome Lomaakko, the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federgewicht-Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four divisions world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds for pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomakenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN.
When the pair positioned for photos, Lomaakko-Manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I am a former feather weight," said Garcia.
"I have risen up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomaakko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomaakko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked him," said Garcia and later expressed themselves open to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomaakko as "a huge fighter", and he may be going to participate in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomaakko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he'd look at the three-fight champion from Riverside"very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus is to show battle strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the moment that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be done.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomakenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four damaged by tyres
In an accident on the A7, four people were partly harmed on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira at 16.30 a.m. was likely to lose the control over his vehicle after a tyre placer.
The car threw to the right into the evil, where he slew over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly harmed in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left trail at the accident site could be passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 season intake against Braunschweig that optimization of the defence formation brings points in Aue.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, the two counters wouldn't have been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two countertors too much, and we have to be more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The threeer chain is also intended to be further optimized in the Erzgebirge.
And a gate after a stranger, the fortunes will no longer catch themselves.
"For the future it will be so that nobody's next to Michael (Rensing) will be on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better accomplished even after the experience in preparing the three chain than with the fourer chain.
"Now I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "as we have just in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"Demand is, but that we are even more harmonised and we do not make so many play errors in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"If you can talk about a failing start after a decision, you don't know.
The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann.
"When we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a ordinary season's uptake."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start in the season I'm going to turn only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of a benefit to Aue, just because the play of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be suspended in advance because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they did not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the legs.
"But they don't know 100% where they are currently standing," says the interior defense of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the event at the final (fast) stage of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday.
"That we disfellowship them only because we have the right to come under the first six, it's stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is very positive at only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Federal League that has to beat from before," Fortunas Chef Coach explains.
"Taking such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel wants to experience his players on Sunday in no case.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Asylum Evaluation Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subject to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Real Medicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Agency) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less years old.
Until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of total 2.481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in 25 other cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are persistent in the past months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lying over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases "proposing that the investigated person was 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knee enchants, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologs, was also criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans, to see if they went earlier or later as usual through the puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Rating the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of unfair assessment of a child as adults is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just below 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
Works at the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well advanced.
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's running super," says Reinhold Light, construction leader at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Presidium Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time at all three sanitary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction end is intended for October and is easy to ensure that the schedule is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, runs through the Trombach.
It is a bow-bow bridge of concrete, clothes with red bundle sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of the transport, the three buildings are now being thoroughly cleaned.
The two other bridges run over Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandy sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach now had a width of 1,30 meters on the northern side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge mounting, which is also used as an operating path.
The southern part of the bridge is intended to use a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap on Friday.
It will then run the walking road.
The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger Firma Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingers are required to move lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of work by handbook.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collective wheat towards Schramberg, the traffic is determined by a sample.
For construction at the bridge at Lauterbacher Orteingang, the road in the area of the bridge is fully locked up at the height of the hotels "Tannhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridges are totally EUR 700 000.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest in German potato salad
It is not so frequently that parties draw on a strike, but if it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the Circle Day of Vulcans (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are one of a wide band that shows a peaceful flag this day because the AfD invites Rondell to the "great electoral pocket" in the Gerolstein Hall.
And known names at the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestagswahl on 24 September, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD teachers but to demonstrate.
The motto "The ice cream remains tiny."
Originally, the city-picknick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A bunch of pictures that offer.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums One world and one of the major organizers, is really happy: "Too many people have gathered here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "urt German potato salad, which could also eat the AfD without trouble," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the places of event.
How did the AfD actually come on a gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports of the AfD Vulcanneifel that he has strived for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because for the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking lots.
So the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
In view of the event at the Rondell forground, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: By 20 o'clock, a band on the Rondell for entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rheinland-Palessian AfD Chairman Uwe boye.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Federal Day election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-President Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but the officials have had a quiet evening.
Something more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front have a longer breath, but there is also cleared up shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can decline - no special incidents.
Posaune hits trompete
A resignation with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is found in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the clown circle.
Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the Motto "Black Sea Meeting on Black Forest" or also "Balcanfolklore" meets a classical German training with roots in the Blasmusic.
Both solists are winners and prizeholders of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is solotrompeter at the renowned concert building Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra Soloposaunist.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach, like in a new wall, joins Daniel Schnyders "World Music" with Bulgarian Folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzecho Prizemaker Nils Wogram, mix classics, Jazz and the free games to a fascinating total artwork.
This core part of the programme was carried out only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specially for the two musicians and more: The hatching clowns with their special acoustics are consciously included in the concert.
Christian Stewart speaks about their bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Christian Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I'm biting in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was the "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually interrogated bitterly.
In spite of all this, the brunette darsteller assures the Harper's Bazaar Magazine: "I was in love with everyone I've dated seriously.
Or do you think I had played it?"
After their separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and believed seriously in it.
So it has never confused or disturbed me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
She suffered especially below, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, than she prefered to dress themselves like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared and scared.
Now I look back and think, "Children, be proud of you!"
In particular, she does not like to explain her love life: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that makes me angry.
And maybe some mention me as absurd, but I don't like to justify me before all the public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday tonight with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said the Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in jubilee.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement before the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionary in the state, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes finds that he has coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business by his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee gave a statement on Thursday evening, in which it said: "The change of the governor of Justice is another struggle for a democratic party that would prevent us from working rather than to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governances and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without lead and is not able to find a positive, agreed message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe commends "early" Russian excuse for Doping Scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of light-athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a Doping Scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-incorporated into sports.
Russia's Leichtathletics-Chef Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress at the evening of the Lightathletics World Champions that the ban on his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all the athletes that were taken away from gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of Stately supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized by itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said that he was also "joyed" that Russia accepts the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to resume Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added
Negenteen Russian athletes will join the light athletics world champions starting on Friday in London after the strict IAAF criteria are neutral.
The leader of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reconstitution.
Drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sadness for crashed soldiers in Mali
At a sad celebration in the north-hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed at a helicopter crash in Mali have thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domain under high security arrangements.
The Defence Minister Ursula said nothing about the Leyen (CDU).
But she referred to the two survived pilots as "Kinders of her Fach".
"We are disguised by this highest victim that they have offered on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their sarches were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the Federal War to the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At lunch, only the relatives in the church dismissed.
After that, the wedding celebration began in the family circle, close friends, representatives of the federal war and politics.
In addition, Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Federal War Volker Wieker.
The sad guests put roses down, the relatives stood in arms on the sarges.
Before the church, Fritzlarers and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
The Defense Minister of the Leyen called the deceased soldiers "high decorated" and experienced.
The Stabshauptman has built up the flight operation of the battle helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Also Volker Bauerachs, commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belonged, stated: "If this crew couldn't turn off the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts of the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of Leyen that the use is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the sad celebration, the arches were brought out of the court.
When and where they are reserved, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prinz Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be found next to his wife after his death.
That told the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish kingly pair is attached to the dome of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarkophag for the two.
The Queen consented with the decision of her husband, it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, it's still unclear.
But he does not intend to be attached to his French home.
Prinz Henrik had never made a hole that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne confirmation of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to be king.
In 2016 he retired and also put the title "prinzmale".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish king's house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be final, it is still unclear.
However, he intends not to be attached to his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French anal sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French message.
During his later wife always fled to the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In a autobiography, Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk flushing instead of sticking sugars, citrons instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and who had the reputation to this country to be the trademark of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for insight.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were like two mistakes!"
President Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Niedersachsen
Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has been resigned after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick new election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, the resolution of the Parliament was expressed.
In the past, the surprising exit of a Green Member from its country-day fraction in Lower Saxony had caused the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country-day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its little one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green Members Every Twesten justified their step with the non-Nomination for the election 2018 in their electoral circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Manager Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take it up.
So CDU and FDP would have 69 seats together in the Lower Saxony Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was reversed.
The new country day will be selected on 14 January of the coming year.
Thumler said that the red-green country government must now decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, it considers it essential that the landing day decides as quickly as possible its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the countryday will dismiss the President's confidence and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be checked legally cleanly," said Thumler.
"You will be free to discuss all questions when they are legally reasonably reviewed."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something kurios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a betrayer.
I feel very good."
She called herself an adhesive of black-green.
The Greens called on the deceased Members to return their country-day mandate.
"We, of course, assume that she gave her country-day mandate, which she received over the green country list, with immediate effect," shared the national presidents Meta Janssen-Cucz and Stefan Körner.
The President-in-Office of the Green Anja Pil said, "We regret the decision of each Twest."
It has deliberately decided not to debate in the Group.
"In front of the background that there were no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
The SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Lower Saxony Green Members each Twest to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Niedersachsen is not only betrayal to the voters but also to red-green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to let the country day be re-selected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her injured nobleness and in her frustration her personal interests toward the welfare of the country", criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to hit political capital from it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Fraction Manager Björn Thumler wants to recommend his members to include each Twest to the CDU.
The chief of the SPD in the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesten to falsify the result of the 2013 country day election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and greens had a thin majority of one voice in the country's day.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gifteiers, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarn.de, the Federal States shall provide the latest information on the egg charts concerned.
Eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the Federal States.
However, my house has immediately turned on and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthless.
If the maximum residue levels of 0,005 mg/kg are exceeded, they are not traffickable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time is not the company's fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production companies do not have an immediate debt.
Instead, they have to expect economic damage due to countervailing illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too little controlors in serious cases.
Does it only lack the staff or also the decisive responsibility?
It was just the official checks that revealed the process.
The truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent.
This is why a consistent disclosure of such events and the transfer to the lawyers in cases where criminal offences may be present is essential.
I have already made it clear several times that I am expecting a delicious disclosure from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alertism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food economy, consumers are rightly disturbed.
By means of the funding, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of foodstuffs is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the situation will be cleared quickly and unfairly.
How the financial rules of the football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football associations will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some of the consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the executive organization that has monitored the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournier.
Financial Fair Play rules that the UEFA started in 2011 mean that PSG must at any time prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be more than $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG can certainly make the money relaxed so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy-rich governing family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to make the Break-Even point in their business related to the football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his choice as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success deceived effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP layout period, running until 2018, clubs can take 30 million euro losses.
And although Platini has fallen in Unnade in 2015, his UEFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to take off excessive expenditure.
"Safely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's Buy Out Clause in a Pauschal, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the amount of sales for the next five years can be set up at EUR 44.4 million in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of EUR 60 million (when 82 million dollars) that was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014/15 remain to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenue through companies that are connected to the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was blurred by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on payments from the Organisations Committee of the WM 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM messengers and could be easy to find out such a manuscript for the UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more careful to observe any attempt to cope with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparing conversations with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, since they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS with regard to the final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsen Vinger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a State that finances a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years," said Winger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, chocolate Frey has produced table chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the collaboration is a possible end: the airline rewrites the contract.
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news Agency sda a corresponding report of the "Nordwestern Switzerland" newspaper of Friday.
According to current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier of chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-weight chess tables distribute to 14 grams per year the air carriers before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss wanted to do no information about the costs.
Brancheninsider estimates the volume of the order according to "Nordwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around a billion francs.
But more important is every time the advertising effect: for a shoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious job.
How many applicants there are in the new invitation to tender, the Swiss does not want to tell.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has distributed chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the daughter of Migro, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tables in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
During long-term flights, customers of the First Class are convened with delicious property by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class neat passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by chocolate Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light athletics - Discus-Olympiasiager Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-month world champion fights a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympian of 2016, failed in the national WM excretion and could only look at the Discus-Wettkamp from the Tribüne.
In addition, with the first attempt, the Polish title defense Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres wide, was qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nische
At the same time, this repetition of history is nostalgical because of the glorious days of the character of the 80s, for the 90-year-old era (as the predent David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch coma "The State" turned for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artefact, it is likewise a parodie and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By raising on the core of the gag - actors of the middle age, they played yellow children who are grown up - they nevertheless created the impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more in accordance with the casting cable principle, including a reef on the stalker film of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that shocks the weighs").
At one point, a character runs through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The delightful Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy, wicked plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
Like always, the excursions are the best part of Franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the ever young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lip bar of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old knight.
It's the moments of random madness that this franchise could heat up like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how it will visit the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgie: the reliviation of the Cold War of "The Americans", of the film "Atomic Blonde" and even of "GLOW" with its East-Gen-West Ring Fight Iconography.
The coma created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighth years with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bukarest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-saved Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also a exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than one idea.
There are some beautiful gags to see (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer that wears a reagan maske - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes it moves there, and the coma is not fast or frequently enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a lower length, could deliver his Agitprop Satrie better, since Gregor and Iosef visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feeding for a site.
The fictional Romanian Creators were not wrong: We do it even with our own younger history and with the herd.
Slag against Drugs-Mafia in the country
The police have managed a battle against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Creise, in Rottweil, Constanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state lawyerkonstance announced on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and were already imprisoned against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, shot weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in the case of contemporary razions in Italy.
There were German arrest orders against the two suspicious Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action was involved in Italian and Bayerian investigators.
In total, over 300 policemen were in use.
The members of the Mafia are organized drug crime, severe violent acts, attempted murder, robbery and depression.
Since summer 2016, the state lawyer determines constance against organised drug trafficking in the Southern German area.
Between the state prosecutorships in Constanz and Palermo, the Kripo Rottweil investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily.
It was therefore also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In view of the surveys, the Italian nationals, mainly, were in the list with a close reference to the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident in Hüfingen on May 27, when several shots were fired into a guest place in the early morning, would be expected to go to the account of the bands.
How complains about great gaps in foreign registers
"Data of citizens that should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign registrator in Germany shows significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious failure decisions in the case of asylum procedures.
The Officer for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen way, has made a media report aware of major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could result in asylum procedures and departures "partially serious failure decisions" warned in an analysis of the 'South German newspaper'.
The register shows that 10 million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data were not sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not yet been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on travelable people are covered by EU citizens who would not have to get out of the world.
However, such false associations led to "a distorted debate on the dealing with travellers", then it is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16-year-old children to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is based on an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper, BAMF therefore says that the BAMF will take such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has not been practically possible, so the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on site.
Following the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU Member State are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel into another EU country, this State can send it back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "The admission capacity for families with young children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has provided guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) believes that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The indigenous speaker of the left fraction in the Federal Day, Ulla Jelpe, criticized this decision: "Familys with children threaten because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a danger of child welfare."
Second best result
In total, 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichbach, the blood donation service was already available to other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Allen in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with its 100 donations in the meantime.
Traditionally, the municipality at the meeting of the Board of Municipalities recognises the multiple willingness to spend blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it, and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, still unselfishly," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conserves are broken into their components.
So three people could already benefit from a donation of blood.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK-Criisberry Chairman.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multi-spenders and were excellent for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Feder ten times per 500 millilitre of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.25 %.
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakness of inflation have reduced the speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "trage" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee's political decision-makers (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to maintain the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month seeking to increase, as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and to 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, whereas inflation in the autumn is expected to increase to almost 3%.
But she indicated that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary in order to violate the inflation heated by the Brexit, and she said that the credit costs may need to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut economic package that was released one year after the Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak short-term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
To the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "no greater" extent than markets are expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "steply" and "limited".
The Bank’s growth forecasts for this and next year, corrected downwards, are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts in May.
She maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euro.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have declined the increasing expectations for an increase in interest and GDP increased from 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3%.
In the third quarter, growth is expected to be 0.3%, although it will be easily recovered after the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report has made little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increase in inflation and low wage increases, as the reinforcement will become even worse first before it will improve.
She added that in the next few years the monetary policy cannot "avoid income", but it added that the wages will be "precise" at the end of their three-year forecasts.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate part of the lower consumption expenditure.
One year after the reduction of interest rates, the decision comes to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote resulting in the decline of pounds.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.
Before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest was increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, and three political decision-makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5%.
The inflation has decreased from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and will rearrange it in the coming months.
The Bank said that the override in relation to its target of 2% is "ganz" to attribute to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the hypothesis market should be more competitive, since the creditors are seeking for business and want to finish the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and close the new hypotheses, and many with free options and low rates become more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10.000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicinal product in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual transport, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by approximately 86 percent, is now delivered by healthcare service over a first three-year study for estimated 10.000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The Thursday chess train was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", during the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the firsts that will allow people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious hazards.
Taking PrEP before sexual transport means that just enough medicines are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Those in question for treatment include male or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study, including men, women, transgeners and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home physician can also log in for possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study should assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted to be used, taken and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said, "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted to needy and hazardous people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now as the PrEP test medicine has been created, we are in the best way to protect more than 10.000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Sharon Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process has been welcomed and overdue after months of delays and thorough implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transmission of this life-changed infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us to get a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
The great life of life: Intermediate and smart designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"From that time I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and she had the same high tyres.
I loved her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely overwhelmed.
Originally, a single-room apartment with a narrowed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a vacuum room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high covers, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my demand," she says.
For this purpose, she assigned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high decks and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms across each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a intermediate floor in which you could stand.
Invention had to think creative to solve the standard.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without we had to blow ourselves.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height across each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, room and light.
On both ends, a short corridor is reflected to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrors offer space for all beakers and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if not used.
Collapseable kitchens are not new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garagent door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the stolen, furnished MDF door.
"It's counter-weighted, so that when you push the door up, it's very easy to gleam."
Thanks to the clever use of space and vacuum, Joanne could win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"On the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate maker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the soil surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't love the electric plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate imperium
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a conflict due to one of Victoria’s largest real estate imperials worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. This brought him to the Supreme Court to make clear how their property and business are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but there is a sharp dispute about separation in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estates in value of more than a half billion dollars, collected since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail businesses.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the city.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul - has described as "major operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of company capacity and Paul about one third.
A judicial act states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul $176 million.
The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failures.
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to teach the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides of lawyers.
Mrs De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate foods from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeans shop of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years at the high school when Paul was a young child (approximately 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property kindly to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when the company left and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter."
Colin has been very reluctant, although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain to me and to draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that "he's still hoping for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trumps new Staff Officer plans to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Staff of the White House, met with the leaders on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that goes into the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letterings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to team trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is enough decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If the candidate Trump was angry for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to be convinced," said the former electorate Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habits under control, according to six former electoral officers is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits ever were "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that Trumps Tweets, without their interventions, would contain more flammant.
We're probably never going to know anything about the Tweets who didn't send trump.
If his employees had been able to keep him away from trouble sometime, their efforts were worthy.
But no one could consecutively prevent Trump from controversials.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to make their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - fully involved in this story - reported in May about the favorite of the consultants to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officers say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone evilly accused the president of a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocate Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of shakans, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had spoken wrong contempts in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Stabchef Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "had attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper crane that the Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still pursuing influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.
Most prosecuted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the support of the population will be requested and hoped.
In this summer, the police across Europe sends (virtual) postal cards to dangerous criminals on the escape.
Since the addresses of the sought criminals are not naturally known, references from the population are hoped and prayed.
On Friday, Europol reported the action followed by the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar from winter.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees hide from vacation destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postal cards for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been seen over 2.5 million times.
36 of the online visits have been able to be arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to 'Millionary Series'
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands stand back with some decisive travelers on the foot of war that have negotiated a grave drawn from the municipality in order to require a field before their master houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 living cars on a field outside a rich street of Solihul, called the "millionary race".
They brought horses, babies and a army of carriers after being thrown out in May, but without being scared by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence plants and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a path.
Anxious inhabitants have pressed the Solihull Council, who said it is "needless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous inhabitant said, "You were moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement, since it was unnecessary in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More came yesterday evening, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipality tax if the Council cannot even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the country outside the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Foresthotel Luise is located
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Forest Hotel is Luise.
The house is currently renovated before the gates of the city of joy and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because by closing the Birkenhof Hotel through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year lost, and also revenues through the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of a dramatic increase in the number of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Country Council as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum candidates by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not indisputed at the municipal council at that time.
However, most importantly, Oberburgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious stakeholders at the house at that time.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with manager Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star-Plus-category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the rejoicing town.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time before the entrance, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were shaken out, covers were partly decorated, old bathing waters were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large accessible showers, the entrance area is transformed, new windows are built in.
Everything was to be "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a jewel out."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the equipment.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a lifted Innenstadt-Niveau, stresses Scherer.
The forest hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidays, groups or businessmen should feel well at the hotel.
Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause have already been conducting, so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asking for the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define itself precisely.
Nearly below a million euros, he calculates.
The outside plants are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace, which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russian business: US Specialists are taking Grand Jury
In the Russian shop about U.S. President Donald Trump, specialist Robert Mueller has to use a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The body has taken up the work in the past weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" with the call on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there were already the first preliminary requests of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. Home Services have been accused of the Kreml for a long time to have joined the presidential election campaign in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is to be on several men who acted as consultants of the Republican in the electoral campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps of private and business environment under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump personally pushed into the center and examined the condemnation whether the President may have disturbed the justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether accusation should be raised.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecutors.
Mostly they are activated when it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always under closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the lawyer in order to invite people for an inquiry under Eid.
According to the CNN broadcaster, preliminary requests have already been issued that are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement, it was stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps advisers and Schwiegerssohn Jared Kushner and his damal electoral chief Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.
On Thursday night in the US TV, legal experts said that the settlement shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that he, if necessary, wants to act quickly.
But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the collection of a charge.
However, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new explorations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the Democrats a way to "be well-being because they have nothing else that they can talk about".
His special consultant Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he doesn't know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
However, they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House welcomes any action that accelerates the work of the specialist in a "fair" manner.
The former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that it wasn't to be detected against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the statement.
Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this casting, prosecutions against Trump had become loud, he wanted to impede justice.
Comey said to a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the national safety adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
After presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.
This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the press of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republikan and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that could no longer be released as easy.
Antarctica: Gigantischer Eisberg drives in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a giant iceberg has solved from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the shelfeis.
This informed the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday.
The colosse, large over a billion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square miles [5800 km], will now drive north and will probably need two, three years until he was merged.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come out of him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collisions of ice creams in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be associated with the heating of the earth.
The now cancelled Colosse was a part of Larsen-C-schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
Thus, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
At the north of this fork was the balance of waxes and cancelled a few years ago.
A complete shelfeis was broken there, says AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks some of the fact that the Larsen-C-schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of Schilfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice disperses as much water as after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelfheise leads to the grinding of the glaciers directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf of Antarctica according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front of the free sea about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Even though it is a natural thing and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us, the ice sign now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Under scientists, whether the Larsen-C-schelfeis will grow again or go back on a long-term basis and may be collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice creams of the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken down in the past decades.
This long ceiling of Antarctica extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey Research Programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square miles [28 000 km] since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
During the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and is counting on the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants home tariff at staff
Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free offices, the CDU calls for abroad from the employer association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day went through 41 new bodies in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now again, 17 trainers have their first working day behind themselves.
The teachers at the circle are apparently very desired.
About 620 applications were made available for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, further staff are missing in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann circle.
The application will include doctors and engineers as well as powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative on the circuit day together with the FDP and the UWG and to face the lack of experts in administration.
The management is intended to develop a concept of staff gain and staff development as the parties wish.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for professionals but to counteract future disadvantaged candidates, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inside and outside, to show specific measures for cross-border climbs and to include a public training, to require CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you did not know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers".
This is a high number of employees who exclude illness or older conditions from the service.
So the maximum time for acting so that no more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of Group of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a fabulous surprise during the circuit day when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and the rest of the parties excited.
People want to be reviewed all the possibilities that allow a disfellowshipping from the local employer association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the Circle Cities - should seek a domestic tariff," says people.
The CDU is thus trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff regulation.
The wages are currently precisely required, increases or more money are only available when switching to a higher level that is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years.
It was only a few weeks ago that new rooms had to be set up where employees cared for the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least by the increasing number of asylum candidates, landrat Thomas Hendele and circuit director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the sound to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin Day Newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had captured a boat from the German Aids Assistance Organization 'Young Rescue' because their team had worked effectively with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for one year, refused to express itself to the detailed claims of the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the rescue of human life remains our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can currently not operate in the search and rescue zone," the organisation said in an opinion on social media.
"We can assess all the accusations currently being raised only after we have collected all information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Jugend Savet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes snake boat migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human dealers, and that the smugglers can ride down so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was reported to take only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the State Advocate, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to oversee the authority of the Italian coastal guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Behavior, boats like the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue efforts have been willing to follow the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Thursday said that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring "real changes or disabilities" with their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti said, in recent weeks, that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had fallen significantly in the past weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and collaboration with local citizens have carried fruit.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He gave plans for further discussions with Libyan Citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Tsjad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin's Outdoor Posts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friends guides available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal was a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the forest and the pre-layer planes.
In the meantime, there were repeated increases that rewarded long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurst Market.
Again, the prospect point was at the prospect point, associated with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many altitude meters were set again.
Holes, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and indoor cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed sole in the free air inhaler.
New city was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 metres, the group had met the forests from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Federalliga is equipped for e-sport
Do the sport stars sit in the future before computer consoles, instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium breeds?
The fact is: E-sport has been a serious industry, become a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments including.
This has also recognized the first federal Leagues who are increasingly involved in this field.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, followed the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to enthusiasticly enthusiasm young target groups for the VfB," says Chairman Jochen Redtgermann.
He's sure that "this is going up on this train a number of associations".
The next weekend, the FIFA football World Association in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the gamers of various clubs attack each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have been qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-port.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen are now consulting an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The United Nations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under the contract, you could be more frequently present online on these markets than only once a year to send the federal team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA at competition level.
The longest, as in normal sport, has set up liqueurs in which the professionals are approaching each other.
And in the 2022 Asia games, e-sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it at all a true sport?
For many, the idea is certainly common.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport High School in Köln, E-Sport is an sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, technical and tactic understanding and rapid reaction capacity.
Professional gamers should not only train their body at the console, but also take care of the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobouse, however, also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic."
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integral effect of the e-port.
The players are internationally on their way, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of company advice Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, there were 50 million euros in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
For three years, sales will be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football bundesliga, this is little.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports species such as handball, basketball or eishockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
International is still a lot of countries.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wettanbieter Unicrn.
There are also some things in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teacher, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and in France, football-Erstliga-Vereine are now obliged to set up an e-port department.
"In European comparison, Germany is behind," explains VfB Board of Directors Redtgermann.
Only to fall in Nostalgie, and to declare the old times is not enough today.
It is because of maintaining the tradition of the association, but the company at the same time focuses on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," also Dutt says.
"It's not possible to say that only in the football everything remains the way it was always."
Gift-Eier ade - The egg alternate for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonable eggs has now been affected by almost all the federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have reacted and Germany has taken all eggs from the sale.
Only eggs that are shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the rolls.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that force Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind gadgets and five years have been suspended to pay.
Carter was condemned in June because of a negligible killing of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until the call.
She had been faced with a maximum punishment of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a psychic disease.
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the lawyer to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility," she said.
" She didn't repent."
But Carter's lawyer said that it's a terrible condition that she regrets.
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that "age or maturity or even their mental illness has a significant influence on their actions".
A lawyer read a statement by Roys mother Lynn Roy, who said there is "no day in which I don't guard the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am surrounded with everything. I try, despite all my pains we will bear with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would "trace the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children.
"Not more to have this only person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poison in a vehicle.
The case raised national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stop, jump from a building, put yourself up, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was in vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator into and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she would benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced for murder in 2007 to her British companion in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lamb of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich could run up as a captain at the Audi Cup, is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup winner a large season - extra motivation does not harm it.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very small.
But as wide and wide on the second day of Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Newer to see, he made himself the binding assigned to him to the arm.
"The trainer hasn't announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first use as a Bayern captain.
Well, the event could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could show Kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a play leader in the professional C-Elf, which was from youth players, debutants and just from vacation.
Sugarl is the most loving one to those to whom you are familiar with much you want to keep at loune.
So whoever has been exquisite to enter the inheritance of lamb, a small extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled as a mini lamb over the field.
Right behind, that's now his position, the white bond on the arm did your other.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this start formation like the one who can take the rod in the best hand.
He gave instructions to attempt to guide the unplayed troop.
He had a whole look, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overcome his lack of fitness (captured hardly); Renato Sanches to get to the devil come out of the services of the Asian Rise (claped only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Tricot.
That always worked very well.
Sile ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The narrowly occupied Napoli tower often made it difficult, and silk also tried a few times successful in the game construction.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we hoped that."
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shift, speed change: "For this style I was also collected."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new accesses, you saw the party afterwards.
For example, Rudy gave not one or two in the catakombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few messing statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard of Süle a interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bayern you just have to win every game."
He doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported himself on Twitter shortly before the game and wishes the ÖFB ladies all good.
The Bayern Legionary is a quasi club colleague of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation spray.
The famous Bayern shower might also need our ladies well.
Enterprises satisfied with Rheinland-Palessian Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often unlikely that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) and the economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz was.
This is shown after more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and tadel the old minister at the same time.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Whissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The largest turning sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Still this year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan-defining procedure, and until 2021 it is intended to stand the construction right.
A role in the country's plans also plays the West Round Trier, which is in the preliminary need of the Federal Traffic Road Plan.
The aim is to take the route in December 2020, says ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives to stimulate a Rhineland-Pfalz label on wine to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sucking for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the IHK praises.
The Chamber of Manufacturing Trier in the new Master-Bonus sees an additional incentive for young trainers, says Manager Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 is provided for the master-examination and EUR 2500 when graduates make themselves independent within 10 years of master education.
But the home tasks list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, it is fast to create facts, at the same time it lacks the country's necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier business leader.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set Wissing on the country's operation of mobility, only 29 jobs are occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to external offices.
CDU-Fractionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of country roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to address the lack of experts in the region.
It is also enthusiastic to the past broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had evaluated network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, Minister for Economic Affairs, Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Windkraft Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she was already clearing the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi wants to change 850.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software into more than 350.000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company was of the opinion that "a smarter option than driving restrictions" and was referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the businesses as a call.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emitte diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install installations for neutralisation of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase, which makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with the ignorement of the signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the defects of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shuttle devices to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but which could return under normal driving conditions.
In the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi’s engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to cope with emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden people's cars: the luxury automotive manufacturer contributes overproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on the morning Saturday a fleet runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it moves again to the Isar on Saturday, he will see a large fleet between the flaucher and the Reichenbach bridge.
And that's not a common fleet, with Isar tourists.
In particular, the construction referral wants to explain.
On the fleet, you see a great info-transparent.
It shows a wasteberg.
The entrance to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wildflow.
Since last summer, the fleet went over the Isar and this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a considerable and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and the laughing against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon signs, the knalls of his figures are his brand marks.
Also with 85, the Argentinian still signs and works on a movie.
His message: laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself as a signator for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day that was lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artist is inspiring cities.
Grosse, round murderillo figures are tumbled in drawings with the skiing tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow.
In the early morning, he says that he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours daily.
About calendars, puzzles, books for Gross and Small, T-shirts, plungers and watchs, its drowsive figures continue to be widely spread worldwide.
For six years, he has also been working on a signtrick film and a TV series with its figures.
The main person in the "Crazy Island" film is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in its drawings - who has a thousand fists as a counterplayer.
For the first time, his figures are spoken in the 3D film that will come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," says Mordillo.
It's not written by him.
That is why he rather puts on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without delay.
Lavendel from the Provence threatens climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is declined due to the conditions of drying and the insects transferred to the diseases, which makes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn.
This affects the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cigarette, a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cigarettes, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot in the game.
Lavendel oil is not only attracted for holidays, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with etheric oil."
Among the solutions considered are a better water distribution and the slowing of soil dilution, but also the determination of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thüringian Rhine celebrates his 1200-year-old existence.
It is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creams, coins, dealers, vagants or a land servant should be experienced in the city of the city in these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is required, sufficient perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's or cartel's salary list, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest break of violence, and while the bodies in the whole country are ceasing, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats under federal protection, and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states.
Her publisher and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas, are among the last ones.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with brillers or its typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although 2010 a special federal lawyer was established to deal with the cases of journalists, it has, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only initiated two criminal proceedings.
Like most thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought before court.
In Riodoce, they are still in the process of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unfaithful and although the terrain is even more betrayable.
Without information about the murders, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He was only able to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with "Twelve River".
The shot drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumours tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.
But about Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battle fields in the country, since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the Friedhof is full of decorated, two-staged mushrooms for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of "ruhe" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalizing cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angry the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaperskioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the capturing of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of participation.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without fighting the noise problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest report, and the sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish thorough investigations without fear of censur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for its reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that is to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in view of so many dead people... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird that could fluke like a harbour, the friend who was generous with rearms and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and remain alive.
"You don't like it if you are working with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start and landways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-conservation and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "Grew a sense that can be betrayed ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-stage building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrusted.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition to the government expenditure focused on the home city of the governor.
And there was a group that took away a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was commanded when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governmental institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-care cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slank body station.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
The office of Valdez was converted to the storage room for signs and clamps protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Journalists across the country have become more loud by writing down in organised protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
This day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out and killing journalists because they said the truth.
She has since prayed that she be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "inherited" by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an inequal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug bands but also on order of politicians and security forces who were under a deck with organised crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was claimed to be signed by the Zetas Cardel, "I am here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug card with a lead article on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in the exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poetry, admits that the drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already been completed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizen's climb before the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum up.
A number of fireplaces with bandenrivals and security forces near the bathtown Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirenen healed nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were in willingness.
If they were at all scared, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used tarnation to avoid his enemies
On the first look, it looks like a statue, even a scary.
Now researchers have found that the first knowledge of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mining worker was so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find out that his shocky skin was of red brown - and they said they had something of a "unfortunate past."
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-holded dinosaurian ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, living in the middle of the creide time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-conservated condition has excited researchers, who describe it as "incredibly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the plant feeder is the best preserved fossil of its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place and decided to see more precisely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you're just blinding a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter in science history as one of the most beautiful and best-established dinosaurians - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurians."
Researchers have found that this plant feeder, although covered with an armor and is similar to a walking pancer, is likely threatened by meat-fried dinosaurs.
The strongly planted dinosaur used a red and white tarnation to hide from robbers, and used a protective technique known as anti-estimation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to be better mixed in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, says experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurians has been made for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours on covering it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scraps and arms on his body.
They discovered the conterestimation, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the conter estimates are common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds far the size of the animals that live today.
It indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted with sufficient pressure by meat, and that evolution favoured the dissuasiveness of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the contour shading - think of Reh, Zebras or Gürteltiere - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prize, which indicates that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle to survival.
"Starke robbery behavior on a massive, strongly planted dinosaurian shows how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of the creide time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the ground of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further into land than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative skin, but also maintained in three dimensions and maintained the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early cream time.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you only shield a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The cream time was a time when giant theropods, meat-fressing dinosaurs, who were on two legs, went through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the planned dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful forefathers.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was swallowed and mummified after death in the sea.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the permanently planted dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the snause to the hip.
The creatures were averagely about 18 feet (5 metres) long and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long peaks that were squeezed by his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the plant feeder was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater plant preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well received that the skin residue still covers hollow pancer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Constituted residues of the skin still cover the hollow pancer plates that wear the animal’s skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scraps on his soil'.
In the twitter: Massencarame companies on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caram company.
There are many injured, mile - long vacation and gaps.
At the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured at a mass caram company at the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information by the police, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interrupted between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) at the time of a twitter.
The exact number of injured persons had not been reported at first.
It's about light to medium injuries, said a police speaker.
A great offer for rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was fully locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10 - mile [10 km] backstroke was built.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counterway, through numerous gaps.
The fire guard noted the marks of the vehicle lenses, which are now subject to sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 then a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Groups tested "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everybody has experienced: nothing insignificant you're sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and have just a genius thought.
And then: pufff.
Come the sheepman and wake up an insane or screw the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Cart control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the unsafe chart control.
It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take up your seat and thus discount the ticket.
At the moment a test operation is running on two lines.
"If the offer comes, we extend it.
It will then be expected to be available at the beginning of the next year on many further distances in Germany," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the cart evaluation without a sheepman.
In order to use them, however, some conditions need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers have done.
You must also have bought it via the app of the train that DB Navigator has bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works as follows: You get into the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic degradation.
The train accompanyers will receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train companion comes at the route map control at place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to use the passengers again.
"Who wants to travel without ticket control through our train companion, just checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address the individual customer needs."
Whoever often drives trains, knows that in addition to delays and missing moves, ticket controls are among the biggest anxiety.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personal certificate or any other document to be presented is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train consumers and passengers, which leads to bad atmosphere in the department or large space and delays in the control of their own tickets and takes time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this is only on the links of ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart eating.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
Brettany Ferrell was shaken to her core on August 9, 2014.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of a Airbnb apartment she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole over a post from someone from the high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," it said.
As nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retwed on their Timeline.
The rapper from the district of St. Louis was at the end of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., lively.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She put her cell phone down to return to Tweets later in the evening over people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign with the recipe, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed with a police officer standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a belling dog.
In another video, she said, a different policeman reassured his gun and screamed, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This isn't the kind of murder we used to and we can typically call."
At this moment, I felt chill frog.
I was angry and wept."
She buried back and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinema from 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and opposition that consists of the view of people living in the Community and filled with the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell took a flower dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson with her daughter, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “over the black experience and the black condition”.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take them," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be trained in it.
It must be well developed, not only activeism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience an equilatant racism, she is not different from the next black female kid.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authority that became a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non-approved officer of Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activity began to adopt for Ferrell.
"My activeism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
A question asked Ferrell, "Would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This Skepsis was nourished by countless cases of humans, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activeism around death-trainers.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other residents followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film isn't someone who speaks to us or speaks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are being represented, for that is how I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant of the movie.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that in this work and in the humanization of black people there must be a certain injury."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black swollen women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement that, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identifies itself as foolish.
"Black, heavy women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.
Black, tough women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
It is, however, that "this is not an affirmatative type of action", where Ferrell was elected as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"It was the person who broken up this energy," she said.
"It's not an accident, although she was on the front, because in a life of these crossings as a black, sweating woman is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have been disappeared, but the racism of relations between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on control for 21⁄2 years due to blocking a motorway in a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home "A chaos".
Still, she climbs to a song and she feels obligated to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From space to size: TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been divided from the first presentation of 2009 to the population in advocates and opponents.
Cold leaves the topic hardly one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While one says to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be real class" (Nicoles shows), the other side comes: "Don't use a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite plain: "Great swallow!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build that a gallery moves more customers to the city, which also benefits from the other businesses, the opponents fear that the footing zone then bleeds out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the ground on which the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the reconstruction - to the Beda site with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying in the farm market hall for many years almost a week.
Most of all our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of farming women are always very happy.
We also discovered the metzgear for us.
We would wish that there will be a chance of maintaining this offer during and above all after the building of the gallery.
This is also available in other cities.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers are living in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the rentals is reached.
But it is not supposed to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why are shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, drug or supermarkets: I find this overflowing.
There's already enough of it in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a ordinary weekly market here, it is even more important that at least we keep the market hall.
For the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is at the highest price value.
As you see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often unavailable for a retailer.
Sadness, special businesses are almost no longer available and what is left of it will then also be disappeared."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all, where will the farmer market hall go during the construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in durable, if the bit gallery comes at some point.
Or does the Gespenst Bit Gallery already make it possible to distribute all transactions from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anybody.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find -, it is no longer a place for meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farmer market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will be disappeared again."
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarkable - hanging on cables from the cable.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-tubs and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excursions from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analytic sentenced a 35-year penalty after she published as secretly classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a trans-family dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmical analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as a person could look like these genomical data, sharp, even if some intellectual comment is not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has since her puberty spoke openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six infringements against the spionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her picture was oppressed, so much that there was only one picture - a corny, black-white selffie, in which Manning was apparently seated unpleasantly on a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum-bloned pearl - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artifacts such as cigarette dummy and cucumber by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and her imprisoned museums became unequal letters friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually demand only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgenderal troops to find new, two-capable ways to further eliminate the staring breaks he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "thing happens for a certain reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded its excessive signature below (the "i" in her family name is perceived with a heart) a end of the "automatic splitting, whose base has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feeter of Cs and Gs and As, is written in blister.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexikon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hopefully will take from it is that our genome does not care for who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning how it appears from the disciplinary disciplines of the United States, such as King-Kong, with a free-speaking phone.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
"Never keep your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting a goose skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by its own genomical simulations, which collapse as horns of protestants.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with lead pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was shaped with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford search for killing
A countrywide human hunting is ongoing for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who is searched for as suspicious after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been crushed with fatal injuries.
On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of their claimed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Office Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several sticks.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of happening, and detectives investigate the pocket as murder, while the police actively seeking the two suspiciouss, officials said.
Lathem has been an outstanding professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of university relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem had now been admitted and was excluded from the occupation of the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A speaker of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and willing to help the US investigative authorities in any recognisable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged suspicious people to put themselves to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their stay, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that there was something happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We will complete the WADA's plan in the near future" - the Russian Viceptremier Mutko
The Russian Viceptremier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the rest of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a particular stage of compliance with the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK anti-doping).
The WADA plan was updated in this respect," explained Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driver plan on compliance with the code which describes the criteria for the resetting of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to worry.
"All has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to claim Stately supported dopings in Russian sports.
On the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutkos words agreed with Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
At the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
Nobody wants to accept this report without condition," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the Doping Scandal.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moved "in the right direction" to be reused.
Aldi sells no eggs anymore
The company groups shared that.
It was a pure precautionary measure, which could continue to be assumed by no disturbance in health, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi which have been demonstrated negatively tested on fipronil-containing anti-leasing agents.
Aldi wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vain, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," Errett said, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to carry out surveys, contact special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistlelowers to cope with the C-Suite leaders and directly contact the Management Board.
"You have now tools like Strava and Fitbit for persecuting their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement.
Errett said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card of the company that shows on a look which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so that you can browse why.
Enterprises come to realize that a former employee has to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not become the next Uber that was involved in Scandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of disturbances in which those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business option.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year, in the middle of the Uber-Fall in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently logged in as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom "Puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the main business leader is involved, complaints are directed to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats his employees poorly or unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer boykott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business centres.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company centre, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to persecute the complaints of employees.
Well, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden from leaders who were seated in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this complete 360-grade view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, leading the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company began to take ethics, values and employees commitment more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it lasted until the "Social media came to their right," that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital investors who both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is an increasing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than yet.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only intervening.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong to, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve profits when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you find support.
The data on the employee engagement by the experts of the workplace culture are important.
But the data are unnecessary if the managers of a company do not take any measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all, this can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have seen too much on the collection of data.
"For if you don't follow, employees ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Are you worried about it?
And who do not take care of why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employees surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the bruins
It's about 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new fields of exercise on the campus.
Some have extracted their tricotober parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered at the summer courses will return to their final tests after three hours of exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days," said Bruins Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended her days - at least to the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 in order to meet the already completed timetables of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood carried out practical exercises.
They are supposed to stop 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their uptake against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change in the rules of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the many-employed routes of the players.
"We put this huge load on it three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they're climbing, they're great people.
I think, as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
The UCLA will finish its practices when the camp is finished, which, given the clear view lines of its fields, will be no easy task in view of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been designed with footballs that have a protection network behind a gateway.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far come to think that people rent a room there and then put themselves there to record a exercise.
If you have the video tape from a exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third parties' auditors and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It's one of his efforts to fight so-called fact news.
In an opinion on his website, the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fact auditors, which may show results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political topic in Europe, with the French electorates being flooded with false stories in the front of the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they do not manage to eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German declaration that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact review will be started.
"Besides the knowledge of the stories of third parties' fact auditors, people want to make more contexts to make reasoned decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the "inline" article and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news.
Create a comic-Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a slopehole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat at Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaary Yorkshireman with a favorite for historical documents.
"I like to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says sorely.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' surrounds the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpected emotionally found.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobs," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters are always smelling for smoke, for then a fire was burned for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect, as if he would be with himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been hit with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overwhelmed my welcome"), this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyen heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had something: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a cherry to fight the two families.
Guys, let everything go his gang!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pop up in the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's resurrection of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farmer rebellion began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are strongly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', who tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch who the Darrell family hid during the English reform for seven years.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, which focused his own funeral by filling a sarch with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' Favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gay, to make debts again and spend money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advocate indoors."
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-Roman over Elämenmäki, the area of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed by nature since.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to get back to the damn life."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the coverage of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new roofmark (Roundview of Thursday).
Even until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz wants to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't think this (natural!) really," they write on their website released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
We are basically convinced that we, as a Bath Honnefer, know very well about the beauty and attraction of our city."
The action is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one which gives the city an inconsistent loneliness."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be costd by the city of Bad Honnef its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year in the beginning of August, Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the Office.
Like this week.
At first sight a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the punishment attempt.
The meeting took place, not in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the Head of Government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.
So the civilians in the YAS were in the overnumber.
In the military, the government attracts the wings.
President-in-Office Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the marine were dismissed.
Since the failing coup, State Chief Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of armies - mostly due to claimed links to the movement of the Exil-president Fetholah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wire dragter of the pursuit.
Against 486 persons who are supposed to have been directly involved in the punishment attempt, the negotiations have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the punch, Erdogan had called the crash attempt as "Gud's gift", since he gave him the opportunity to clean the forces "full".
But did Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unpleasant in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifest themselves in the lifting of the headtuch ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
Great cleaning at the army and security forces, at least, continues.
In the middle of July, Erdogan, by decree, fired 7395 state servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan taught the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the country.
Three times, under appeal, they put on their role as guardian of the world’s rule of law.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan rejected the power of the military step for step, not least under the call for the European Union's reform standards.
Former officers say that Erdogan is aimed at isolating the forces.
In the Magazine "Vocal Europe" a no-named officer warned, who was looking for a punishment of persecution in abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such development could not make the Nato cold.
In addition, there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the cleansing.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "sensitive", says Nato diplomas.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, more stringent rules for the obtaining of visa for a temporary working permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation is to be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do this by changing the way the US citizens from other countries will spend Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renew routes for Rennsteigshuttle
In the past months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttles has been struggled again - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the marod route on which the tourist train is to be built.
In order to ensure the future of the Rennsteigshuttles on a long-term basis, according to the Transport Ministry, building work on the route is still to be started this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and sanitating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country admits to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühle in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of the construction of the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The Treaty, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finally agreed, explained Sühle.
The Ministry and the Southern Trainers as operators are already agreeing on the technical details.
"This is the driving plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards being negotiated," Sühle said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
This was intended to order the Rennsteig-Shuttle on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig trains, especially in the tourists.
During the last few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route of enough people is used to regulate them in the future.
The stretch is also highly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it could not become more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stifting for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritated professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the FRR co-founders, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chestwars and the type of finger nail.
"The people are funny about them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report.
Modern explosions have developed from their blowable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust his robots according to its convictions" and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's even more disturbing because many robots own the "Personality" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern spectacles have developed to robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shocking.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold-Roboters developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of scaryness and "Wendy" with a "abenteural" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted as well as possible," warms the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
Throughout the day, she also has her moods - just as real people!
It may be tired, fixed on Konversation or it can be "in mood!"
There are many alarming aspects in this rising of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relations - but the underlying female properties, the plays on rape, when you go on a step to Frigid (hids here: reluctant) Farrah, disturbing one most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold a different sex toys.
Their origin and its growing refinance points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional assignment.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes their increasing popularity, they still remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture.
But what goes through the edge zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or disappointing until the free market permits them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a President in the White House who has prudent to have attacked women sexually.
The most terrible aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic pictures that swallowed bodies and the extruded eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a great jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "Personality", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.
Otherwise, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Male
Trumps' great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the inclusion of healthy human understanding
It has become a binary vision of the Trump Era that the political divisions polarized by the US bills have also split families in small format.
About Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice in the United States about how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.
We allegedly try to place our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of tromps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, has visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows is suddenly and very strange on the same side, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades of politics.
This is certainly a good thing about the table, but I find it in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disturbing effect of his Presidency has the power to push us all right.
When we speak of "normalization" and "trump", we refer to the horrible possibility that his fairs will no longer be disappeared one day.
However, there is an even more horrible long-term scenario in which the Trump Republicans of the right wings "normalize" which suddenly appear as an inclusion of reasonableness at once compared to its standards.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgie for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy man - the dog on the car roof, which was 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which both appear as a very mild crime compared to Trump in fact.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify itself as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the carussells of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a coffee.
The horses are hugely large, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinders - all the clowns are crushed and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extreme window and the climbing music disseminates this in a strange way.
So many clevers of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty and thirty years later, and I'm still not going all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large circuit traffic in the north of London.
The Central Park Carussell, however, is still a strange magic experience, since here are two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the career cell, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a buying house to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could carry my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This leads not only to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is.
The poor woman in the house was apologizing, while I was tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with breast pain from prison
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his hands, which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned for murder after a prosecution of the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed stone camps in the early mornings of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly invasion who was hiding in the cabin.
The lawyers have announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius Appell, which they say they are too careful.
The National Prosecution Authority said that it would raise objections to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of Blumberg schools were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the graduates go to the school in the future, four to the real school.
The school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Citizenhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on the Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken court, but then released into freedom.
To this end, the cheerful sharp made a musical with the title "The Adler in the chickenyard".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it blow out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken from him was crushed, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain.
Afterwards, three and four classes showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hands danced with the young gossips, the cylinders wore to the bets.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cakes), it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every four-classer to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed the thanks to the colleagues, the former school director Michael Müller, who continues to jump into teachers, and the parent representatives.
The chicken time is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She dismissed her students very much after two years of education, because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the four-classes.
At the end, all the students had a song of summer and holiday.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first grades have already been notified.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campsite in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal tentants was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while currently an investigation is being carried out.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the bulgars were released later.
The Greek authorities have reinforced the control of the free camp and put any one found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose to impose significant penalties.
The checks will be continued during the entire season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a penalty.
Software updates for diesel vehicles: What the affected now needs to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel-Fahrer have to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smethanin from ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The required updates before apply only to the vehicles that have flushing software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their reconstructions have been arranged for the Kraftfahrt Association (KBA).
How and when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has told you to sign up to each person concerned.
If there is an inspection, it will be done in its framework.
How long will the re-establishments go?
"Swer to say," says Smethanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"For we have seen, the automobile manufacturers do not act on the environment until now."
How long the update will take?
The re-equipment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-outs may be to get a date.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would follow, such as Smethanin.
Does a massive price decline of Euro-4-cars now?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In the rural area there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the priceholders does not want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the Choreography Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belongs to the hosts.
The awards will be delivered at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, President Donald Trump will organise a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
The prizemaker, known with progressive TV series, Lear already announced that he would not participate in the Gala.
The New York Times said: "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that is burdensome to me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify its viewpoint.
The Kennedy Centre, named after the former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city vital
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city tree champion, will be retired next year.
The office is already written out, but appropriate applicants are rar.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city tree champion.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun how he communicates in the press conversation.
He reports of deviating, but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application hitherto meets the demand profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the nearest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the periods of regular cancellation, should still be sufficient time for entering.
As Haslach works for the Administrative Community as a sub-constructional authority, the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they can't fill in them anymore, the citizens would have to go to the advice to openburg.
But close to the city and to it itself is important, says Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate as well as a good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the Office, some important projects have been collected, looking back to guards with pride.
"We make the city vital," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
However, in the future, differentiating projects are also on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofen Parkplatz has been instant.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadiumanation is still topic.
The last one will be hit with about 1.5 million euros to book, "if we do it right," deemed Wacker.
"All in everything, great tasks are waiting for my follower.
The work here is fun."
Designation is available for a city tree champion of great play room.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening can be reacted to many things quite flexible.
"You can move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors praisingly.
Since the old city is under monumental protection, it is important to have "a eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the divorcing city tree champion stresses.
Without this, the city tree champion has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "It's all going over my table at the end."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Mark Neumaier (high construction) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to present a completed study as a diplomat or Bachelor with a specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction order and planning.
The city building is subject to the construction of high and depth, construction guidance, basic acquisition issues, management of urban properties, urban farm with building and urban gardening, and lower construction right authority including monumental protection.
Cycle thrown on lines: Southway trail locked
According to the police, the unknown actors had thrown the blue bike from the rail transfer in the field of Leoben Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the accompanying cargo had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male actors and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the door had been observed by witnesses a pink red roller and a bicycle rider.
"That goes far beyond a lousbow stretch," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the actors would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, and the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic, pönals of the railway customers could also come to the actors.
Overall, the speaker said that it was a "heavy" sum.
The damage was recovered on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern road could be managed without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday, two of them covered the distance.
Goods trains did not fall out, but they had delays.
According to the ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 metres had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help linder IBD (inflammatory brain disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory brain diseases.
The unhealable state of about 1.3 million in the United States and in Britain 300 000 causes stomach creams and bleeds, repeating or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the affected are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to linder their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant darm.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the tarm to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harmful tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory brain disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-stimulating immune cells occur in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their infusions.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mouse in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of Tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammable Darmilieus when the same system works in humans.
The Post Doctorandie Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraga studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mices had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately subjected to this not.
She suspected that the difference was related to the darm microbioms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms, which normally live in the stomach draught.
The thorns of the mice were sequencing DNA and six bacteria species were found in the mice with the immune cells but without them were missing in the mice.
Mouse was raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unreif immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance supporting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be an adjuvant of the tryptophan metabolism known as Indol 3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mouse, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were half-earned, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-producing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach draughts.
It is not known whether tryptophan nephew products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory rheumatoid disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the tarm.
Potentially high tryptophane values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-saison game, before the UEFA-super-cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed the holder roll when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed popular.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues Preparation Asia tour and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho confessed that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready earlier than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva city when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he claimed that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three of four, I thank the association," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have given great effort."
Boeing Paint Dreamliner in heaven
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dream liner in heaven.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. State of Michigan and moved into the form of a dreamliner across the USA, which are several thousand miles.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens, the form was to be a dreamer.
The whole was an expensive test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the boeing logo were painted in heaven.
New depth hit for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked for elections with some concern to Berlin.
Only if no collapse from the party centre, no counterwind from the covenant, then the most important wish of the electoral warriors was.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-regated national capitals with a growing disturbance.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year was not even described by counterwind.
It was deep beats.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and greens.
"This shows once more: Red-Green can simply not rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
The surprise of a Green Member's outbreak has caused the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to a serious crisis.
Five months before the country-day election, his red-green coalition thus lost its single voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundes-Commerce Director Michael Kellner has called on the Absurd Lower Saxony Green Members Every Twesten to return their mandate.
Transmission to the CDU means a clear fault of the electoral will.
Each Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Director and the Green Championships to the Redaction Network of Germany (RND).
"That must not be all true," sucks a SPD game struggler when on Friday forming the new Jobs message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, President-in-Office of the SPD of Niedersachsen, is there after the transgression of the Green Members Every Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD countries associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The Misera began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland Val in March.
A blue eye, no more, the coopers calm down at the time.
After the country-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
This also became - and it became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite has smoothly killed the party.
The coopers reappeared hardly in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him the next depth stroke came.
Citizen Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while burning his city.
And because he made so much wrong in the crisis communication afterwards, everything that could be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW departure and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister was already in criticism for a long time.
Much survey values were added.
Yet, or perhaps just because of this, because in the past weeks, more and more attempted to put the bundle of accents.
The attempt of the former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They gave him because they promised to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because, in fact, there is no blame on the party's internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz hasn't.
At times, the coopers are trying to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is focused on the greens, and above all on the deceited parliamentary parliamentarians Twesten.
"It is incomprehensible and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of Party Links in the SPD Federal Group, the Redaction Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens.
The logical consequence would be that she gave her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD federal fraction, complains about a "underemocratic manöver".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan because of the premier," says Uppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestagswahl, the RND.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the result of the election," said Uppermann.
He urged to explain the backgrounds.
I want to know if there have been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funds for local cores III
Whoever wants to clean up his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at the events that have happened.
Since 1991 it has been in Empfingen renewal areas.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum.
In the revalidation zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindlers, the previous restructurings are a "resume project" - it is eventually important to promote internal development and not only to create new building areas.
On April 4, the Government Bureau Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III.
The funding sum amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest of the municipality Empfingen.
How does a renewal area arise?
You will, as Schindler continue, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area.
In any case, the area limits could also be moved again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the content of the Federal Country Programme "Social City", in which the renewal would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of interior cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject to objects, i.e. per property.
The restructuring area would then be defined as a statute.
The subsidy period for the funding shall last until 30 April 2026 from 1 January 2017.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out, under which the participants in the restructuring area have a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutory decision is to be taken as far as possible, so that the renewal can be started in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out pre-examined studies.
It is because of assessing the urban disadvantages and deciding when and to what extent it is renewed.
It will also be recorded in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
There will therefore be questionnaires that can be postally sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed until the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landscape" which, among other things, deals with the construction state and the cleaning plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "house and housing" book, information on size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "business book" is to be filled in only if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, reconstruction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds operates according to the "Windhund" principle - who comes first, must first.
You can't reserve funds for later.
At the end of the project, photos of the "local core II" were shown to make the presents a reconciliation "pleasant".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between tumbling and showing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the lockers of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £300 per slot.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is at tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a Marine Heaven to South Law for an event highlighting the American production last month costs taxpayers, according to the information of the Military who was left to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Vice-President of the White House made a round of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a barbaric trailer from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Law, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 at the evening of the event of his chairman, the vice-president Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Law on 17 July at 7 p.m. for the event at 15 p.m., and remained until the racing was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the rear flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground at the aircraft during the time.
From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required at last.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could hurt the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was an injury of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're closed," the vice-president replied.
The event "Made in America" was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political upper tones.
At the event, the President prompted the reform of the health reform that was in progress at the Senate and propagated the efforts to reduce governmental legislation.
The use of the plane, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-OP, is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the president's plane was carrying out a taxi service in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's plane by its predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic with the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the vice-president press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often pass through training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Law to dispose of the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also fly 11 hours on this day for non-presidentship support missions.
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in postponing the helicopter on the South Law.
HMX-1 does not carry out budget records for Presidents' flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Defense Ministry for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
The records of the unit indicate the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not contain the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, as most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked insufficiently.
It is of course appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he went through the South Law for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and screwed with the media over his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before cruel task
Top tabs of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga join the table third Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel at the table third Searchsdorfer SV tomorrow from 11 o'clock.
Despite five parties, the peak rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has still received the sense of reality.
Counsellor Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I like the team very well."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, the imports from the high north are most important.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to interventions in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olees, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It becomes difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The new team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the challenger turnier in the Italian Biella French is not currently active at the Federal League Party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czechia) who is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will come to his first use in this season.
The Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has not been defeated until yesterday, was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball with the White Rose Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschilfe, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories on the last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not rich for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the Junior World List in January 2016, someone from the trainer's stab around Marius Zay fills the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really have a happy effect when he put his signature under the law to reinforce sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his urgency to adopt the law," the Congress packaged some "constitutional irregular rules", he used.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels fought against the US prosecution.
In any case, the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
As a matter of concern, investors of the Home OMV, who, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide Nord Stream 2.
The Drohballs are enormous.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump would have to raise the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has seen who could reject the group and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pressed into the center in the hit series of Netflix
Despite the second pillar of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is not over for a long time.
The stacks three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil forces of the show.
With the third stake, the DEA has focused on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Leading by four powerful patents, they operate "like a fortune-500 business" only with more government coupling and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian criminal persecution authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third pile of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Role Backward: The city sets 46 kitchen helps
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's children's days.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas) in its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, vice-president of youth assistance, this is a good news: "We all have been very happy."
Continue to be bought outside house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiling cooled on.
The city operates 46 children's days in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the last Kita year, every 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need grows steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours in Kita at lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer applies also in the 35-hour care, if children stay up to 14 o'clock."
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm the supplied foods, supplement them for salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides over the time range.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly a member of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfactory.
"They are much more linked and it is easier for the cita-direction to implement educational concepts."
For it is also about healthy diet and cooking.
"The kids should help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful.
Also for the kids.
"You have a known force in Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown to be the most economic in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance, in the cost comparison between self-regio and foreign supply for the city, says the press office.
And that, although 46 partial-time forces are re-established.
"But these hours do not fall so much in weight for some 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Choices can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, CEO of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be able to vote in the provinces at the Council elections. Three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Choices can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved in all parts of the electoral process.
African elections for the Province Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats to a electoral process, which is in conjunction with the transition of international fighting actions to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time the elections will be given the power peacefully from a democraticly elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from totally registered 3.6 million voters were registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends at the Colping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
After that, one of the actors tried to take the phone and the necklace of the girl, but it was wrong.
The duo escaped without a bread.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure of the long-term commitment to production in its work in Glasgow by managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has varied about the future of investment in the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees are working in the work that manufactures hobnobs and Rich Tea Cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "experience as first" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch leader, GMB called on McVitie's to say "a concern that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the employees have strongly concentrated on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for human employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Consequently, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a florating production presence at McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received only yesterday a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it, since we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are continuously checking our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the location, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago before Neymar?
The side of La Liga may repent for Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain is not left in her persecution by Neymar after she has delivered an offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Climate?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional player in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board is insisting that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president from this prospect?
When Manchester City in 2014 showed interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll be opposed to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with themselves, this will have the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG media field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to travel off under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar.
Rollers wrapped and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor has deliberately embraced a roller placed in the king's field road before the property number 30 and thus arranged for the clothing of the vehicle damages of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for instructions.
To an accident on the B 215 between pride and reading, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came to him on his driving track, the driver of a VW touran had to wake out and touch the guide plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 19.55 on the B 215 came from Stolzenau in the direction of readings.
In the area of the local circulation of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his driving track, so he had to wake out to the right.
The touran rider touched the guide plank.
In the car there were damages.
The driver of the counterpart car, a Mercedes Benz, had overloaded a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident damaged, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the consumer vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report Unloaded Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Rainburger Judspatzen report on the abuse cases releases Pope-Brutter Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse candal at the Regensburg Judges continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected a excuse from the former Regenburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the dome champion Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedikt XVI..
It would serve very much to see the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own submissions or their false assessment of the operations at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that in the report on violence in the courts are measured by "two dimensions".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "injurious and harmful deeds" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but notefully the "Grad Media Manipulation", says the author Luceta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The custom to mention the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to think that is normal," says Scaraffia.
In the interview with the Bayerian broadcast, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beating had been a very normal educational means", "to be done with freaking children as I was one."
It is unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Incorrectly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he recognises the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report, which has been presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was responsible for the information by the Bistum Regensburg?
Overall, 547 Regenburger Judges were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of attacks, 67 jurisdictions.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "As a result, it can be concluded that Domkapellmeister R. has used physical and psychic violence in many cases.
Just in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused persons, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even associated positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse candal at the Regensburg Judges Georg Ratzinger considers it to be discharged.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "affects of violence exercise by protective commanders at the Regenburger Domspatzen", gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
Firstly, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he appears as a cholerist and perfectist, who became hand-growing of the upper when a domspatz musically did not bring a top performance.
How did you count as his biograph this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the efforts and read the entire 440 pages of the report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
He has just been devoted to eight pages, and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of meditation or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its impact.
In any case, he can be suggested to learn about it too late or to have not taken the first spirits seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "resolution", "Himmel" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent witness, describes him as "warmhearted", "beloved", "fairly", "competent" and "conscious", as very good - humble teachers who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and bonuses and "all the grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has led to an outbreak of anger.
That he was not only knocking with chairs and throwing the key bundle on the ground, but also distributed ear figs and too freaking boys on the hair or ears, he has already confessed himself, deeply regret and excused himself for this years ago.
However, to his honoral salvation, it must be said that such training methods were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you still know such disciplinary methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state school.
Compared to what is actually about in this report, namely excessive sexual abuse and excess of violence at the pre-school, this is freely a bagatell.
There you are wondering whether it is not rather about his knowledge and role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. that many media just crashed on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bayer Pope.
The truth is, however, that Georg Ratzinger's report is unloaded in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any development or co-science in terms of sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have confided to the dome champion.
Not even the parents were devoted.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one interested representative to the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The true problem was in explanation of sexual abuse and is, however, that most victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and sisters, then certainly not a chore leader who would have been a colleague of the actors.
How do the Judspatzen Schools Ratzinger’s role in misuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student formulated it as follows: "In terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had real knowledge and could have stopped the respective actors.
I think it ... also is truly absurd to assume that it has been computed to him ... Bubene have been more urgent or clear or even more opened than to their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "It was not possible to confirm the fact that the students and/or the environment concerned were concerned with him in the framework of the investigation."
So as to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak from any fellow science.
It is also not possible for him to have prevented him or brought him to the display.
That is why there is no reason to bring his good name into line with these absurd crimes, as it happened, unfortunately in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "administrative excesses" were read in the Regenburg Domspatzen.
The former dome champion Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this condemnation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting, everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melanch of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
But this is a misuse of the report.
In fact, there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the courts, between sexual abuse and excess of violence, as well as, we say, other claims.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the jurisdiction.
The whole terrible curriculum education, the cases in which kids of sadistic teachers were regularly chikaned and maltreated and were distinguished among them, all took place at the preschool in Nazhausen and Pilenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have been dominated.
Yet, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
At that point, as most of the witnesses stressed, the theme "preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to escape you and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this is true of Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even linking positive memories with him, even despite violence."
That's how the condemnation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just began to set up and from the courses at a school at which he was not working and responsible, (as the Witness wanted to hear nothing, and then again at 1993.
Does Georg Ratzinger consequently close the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
In this, he pointed out that "the pruning penalty will continue to be exercised in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent insistance.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, when penalties were long banned in Bayern.
Before that, they were encountered in a legal grey zone, as everyone of us probably knows.
There was also a difficult estimate for him, where the affected may have been overdriven or dramatized and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's not true.
Only in 1980, the school penalty was officially cancelled in Bayern.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "Fall Strick of Anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards today.
That's where the prince is.
But of course, this is not true of sexual abuse, which was absurd at all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of contradictions and violence on innocent children's seals, which is far beyond the usual.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. to pull earfish and to the hair and ears, were widely widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was prohibited, he was also strictly obliged.
What picture of his rainburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of penalty also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedikt's XVI., tells from his perspective, where the jurisdictions played only a side role.
Yet, I didn't swear that he had a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding essential discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-ranging institution of national rainburgers, true cultural messages of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to tournae twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and Bonbons alone, you are not making a big singer and standing before every success, like what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heartbeloved people who can't imagine that he could do something like a fly.
I regularly meet how many former courts still today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him that he once was strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most jurisdictions are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he always was a good father's teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but he was also a loving respectful person to whom they are still looking up today and who honor them just.
And please, once again, quite clear: All that is being condemned to him is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for long.
But it's very unfair, a man, only because he's prominent and has a prominent brother to make a media sin bock.
There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, dismisses him.
Now, the claim would offer, a 93-year-old man who acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bayern and perhaps still Germany, no one would eventually know the Rhine Citizens' Judges in peace.
