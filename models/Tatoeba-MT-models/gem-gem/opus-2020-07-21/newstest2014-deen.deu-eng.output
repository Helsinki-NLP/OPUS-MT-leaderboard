Goodach: More security for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 footsteps at the village parking lot has been operated in Gutach - in view of the older Councilhausampel.
Two installations close together: intention or signs?
This question has answered Gutach's Mayor clearly yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was then installed because it secures the schoolway," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser samples secure both bike drivers and bus passengers and the mountainle inhabitants.
The installation taken officially in service yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›GrubÂ.
"In the high transport and footing rise, a further ample had to be made to their safety," says Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"On current measurements at B 33, about 12,000 vehicles, the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent of heavy load traffic, is stressed by Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another sample is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
Four traffic views were carried out, and a circuit transport was also intended, but again rejected because of the closeness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing.
It was tested, according to Arnold, in the location selection of the Ampelmasters: "The means of an extra for us with very long wooden strains loaded we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the samples."
Arnold explained that the approximately 15 000 euro expensive anchorages itself is the "modern thing that is currently on the market".
The installation is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so strongly that the lights of the drivers are well detected, for example, in deep sunshine.
And she's also sparing: The older light plants use about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per drive direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
Pressing the amp button, the upper radar sensor tests the mode of transport.
If the road is free, then immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go across the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safely coming over the road," explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and observe the trailer.
This wasn't the case yesterday: Kaum showed the amps for pedestrians green, poured a top-class vehicle through - at lighting red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing for over 30 years the need for his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of its Catholic village - the languagelessness, the hanging to raw violence and stumping sexuality, the tears and the joylessness - have often described the corn poet.
Known is the booker prize carrier, especially as a prosa author, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher sets together a collection of prosatexts for his performance "weather lights on the tongue peak", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theater maker combines some elements from the autobiographically characterized Roman "The Body Beigee" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family rewarding" (2003).
On the widely empty stage - important requisite: a narrow sofa, on which it is copied and masturbated, hangs the eight-headed ensemble by the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to trust little in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a filling of government cases, known from the stock post-dramatic games.
Especially the actresses come to the somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with the head diving under water, with their evening robbers torque to the wall.
Incorporated in cellophane or leather, they focus on dangerous high sticks through the scenario, either monologize loudly or be completely stunned on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this strangerable way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth is enough from Deep Purple to national song.
Only by the end, the overwhelmed performance gets something to calm, and Winkler's thoughts of absurd humor lightens up.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe the solution has been found in a small black box that finds place in each car's armature board.
The equipment that records each mile driven and reports the information to the authorities are the core point of a controversial attempt from Washington and the planning offices of the state to review the old system for financing US-American roads.
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly evolved an intensive debate with bunte allians.
Libertians have joined environmental groups and claim that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and perhaps where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate taxes.
The tea party is disposed of.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while you cannot agree on a procedure at the congress, several state states no longer wait.
They are currently exploring how they can switch to a system in the course of the next ten years, paying the driver per travelled miles.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a need for our country.
"It's nothing that we'll only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plants a record of the driven miles with all California cars in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by US Americans at the Zapfsula.
But in America, no more is done as much as before.
Cars use less petrol.
The government oil tax of 18,4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise tax at high sprit prices only to a cent.
Lee Munnich, a expert on transport law at the University of Minnesota, says: “The benzene tax is simply not future.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative for the long term," he said.
Officers call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberal sounds, for, for example, the tax was used to influence the driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce dust and climate harmful exhaust gases.
Californic planners use the system for the development of strategies to achieve the ambitionate, statutory objectives of the state for climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also explained that he sees the most progressive long-term alternative therein.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also incurred by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for a relapsed route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 called on the Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
Last year, the US Senate approved a 90 million dollars expensive pilot project, which would cover 10.000 cars.
However, the majority in the representative house prevented the prosecution and thus responded to the concerns of members of rural areas representing people who often have to reside many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several state and large cities are moving to their own faust in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, who currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it in a limited measure with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, among which transport ministers of 17 states belong to the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could pursue each of their movements.
"The concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management in the Nevada Transport Ministry.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to transform the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, locking technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of state states who now look forward to comprehensible technology, with which the State can take up the driven kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
That, like Khan, would be more calm about the public.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company has not initially arrived to help state in the taxation of drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to take foot in a emerging market for Kfz insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the travelled miles.
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for the roadplanners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device and instead pay a fixed fee based on the average miles travelled by all inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrust public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a taxing device that also pays park fees, has to pay insurance only for driven kilometres and raise speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid vacuum.
“Automobile drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate”, says a planning document of the city.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole speech about payment per mile is not just a huge deduction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could solve the problem of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
A supplementary single fee or an annual fee could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Head of Legal Affairs and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers care about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Small crew hits awake
The volunteer fire war handled herbs head samples despite the lack of staff with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his exercise, Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in the Burgberger Straße.
There should have been a short closure in singing.
Two people were injured by the burning fire and the smoking development, but one of them could send another emergency call.
Two breathkeepers of the weather were prepared to enter the building after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and guide to the free.
The second person had to bear.
This wasn't so easy, because it was also a tight step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place through the tank in the vehicle.
Another direction was carried out through a overflow hydrant in about 100 meters distance.
Now, three removal attacks could be made.
For use, there was also a hollow tube in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also about to show in the exercise what is to be done with little staff available.
In the serious case, there is a support for the Kingsfeld day-to-day intervention group.
The commander showed satisfaction with the expiry of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochzwarzwald, the country-day president Guido Wolf was also informed of where the workforce came from tomorrow.
In the High Schwarzwald Support Centre, he went to this important question together with the executive school directors of the professional schools, and the Circlegymnasium and the chairmen of the parent council.
"Education is an important factor in location," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre High-Swarzzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the training model projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the circuit gymnasium and the vocational training centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase but also, due to the demographic change, the phase for the care of families," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees cared for the care and care of their families.
"Unless the support of employers, the burden resulting from the employees can lead to a discontinuation of the working relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could be able to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For whoever has learned the advantages of the region during his study, with its acquired knowledge and skills is often receiving the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the country-day president became convinced.
For only if sufficient training spaces were offered, the needs of experts could also be covered.
He believes that the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already undertaken to develop public passenger traffic on his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Continue to remain tough and make sure that public transport will improve," he explained to the address of the present local politicians.
Music experiences a entertaining afternoon
Already for 15 years the Kaul family invites the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a vesper.
Earlier, the older fellow citizens were awarded in the racing place.
This afternoon takes place in St. Joseph's career home.
The inhabitants were pleased with the delicious cakes and towers.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, talked with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school court before renovation to the Kirchstraße is to be re-settled to the renovation cost plan of the city of Briones.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, to stabilize and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach is to include Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Engineering Office in the plannings and to create a renewal concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation should be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the Council of Municipalities for the decision and the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the next year.
After the renovation, planting and planting of the old school court within the two side flies of the school built in 1912, as a follow-up measure, the sanitary necessary limitation wall must be set from ground to cleaned and on new subconstruction.
The historical, a hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school court to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need to be cleaned and has a bowl in front.
Deep rices in individual stones prove to white damage, but the wall is currently not in danger.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use schoolhof, which has been done by the current firming work.
Originally, even in the years 2008/2009, the school court instruction was planned, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school walling, which has already been used for film recording, will speak with the National Memorandum.
If standards come from this page, then the city hopes the brothers for grants from the monumental protectors.
The students of Bräunlinger's basic school, who are now instructed again in a well sanified old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school courtyard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions on the future of the music high schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now become active.
"I think it is wrong to give up the whole education at the Stuttgart Music University," said Özdemir, "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and classics belong to the Jazz Station of Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, which is considered a favourite for a direct mandate at the Federal Day election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Rotate Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a rearrangement of five music high schools in Baden-Württemberg.
The study of Jazz and Pop from the Stuttgart Music University is to be transferred to the Mannheim Music University.
U.S. Limit: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities announced, the more than 500 metres long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, rail glasses and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar," said the U.S. state lawyer of South California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a camphouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered a end of the tunnel.
Duffy assured the drug bands: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug card.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
As a result of the inherent equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The glass plant was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel ring.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1,20 metres height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested because of the captured marijuana.
All three threaten as the highest punishment of lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "terrorism" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have now been cut off, says Bill Sherman of the DEA drug flag in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
There were no details of the arresters, at least one of them were Mexicans, said it.
You have to expect penalties up to ten years.
2014 Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at the 1250.
Repeat the first urgency pointing is increasingly closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned 794 for the first time.
In churches, a certificate was made in which both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official intake to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this intake event takes place in the place, where both were mentioned first 1250 years ago, in church houses.
During the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be 1250 in July at a festival end of 18 to 20 July.
We're gonna celebrate again.
On Friday with a festivity, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
At the end of this week, the church house is still a church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commission composition for the city at the time of the anniversary, which is listed at three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and invited in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new Chronicle is also brought out.
"It is supposed to be a chronic not only by Geisingen itself, but a printed work on today's geising, which is just composed of Geisingen, Church Houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadings," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the hostage of today also celebrates 2014 Birthday, 1974 the present space was accomplished with the intentions.
The new Chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
However, 2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8, with a breadsome evening at the time of its 60-year-old existence, the harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and then celebrate the district music festival on 29 March and then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the Music Association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the spring festival from July 4 to 7th.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The magazine was manufactured in churches, houses, which were then courtyard.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate.
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is still 40 years.
The Council takes leather plants into the Visier
Do you want to reconstruct the "Am Hirschen" train to increase transport safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach must take 220 000 euros in hand for this.
The German Railway will improve the Kinzigtal railway in the next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail crossings - regularly the collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities agree with the restructuring measures, they have to participate with a third in the costs, the rest share rails and covenant.
Shiltach's city tree champion Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality Council the specialities of the "Am Hirschen" train transition.
There the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnel coin west of the rail glazing.
There may also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, in the case of counter-course without having to block the glasses.
Consequently, greeter proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the following road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his comment, brought the mind of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand for so few vehicles?"
Citizen Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway transition "hirschen" is used regularly for longwood transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partly transported through this route, because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route on the haeberles bridge because they could not be on the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a circuit for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, argued haas.
Since Kirchberg and Castle Tunnel must be reconstructed and reconstructed, as is currently the case in Wolfach, it can also come to an important importance for a longer period of transport.
The councils agreed to examine the costs that would result in the contemporary spread of the road.
Despite this, the reconstruction of the railway transition was more than one of the measures that required support walls were built in such a way that the city could expand the following road towards the railway road, where appropriate, for encountering traffic to approximately 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway transition at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem of access to the strongly rising "gerollt houses road".
The administration had been able to examine the restructuring plans of the train by the Brainlinger Engineer Office, as it doubted whether the planned connection of the Gerolltzhaus Weg would be possible without any further.
The investigation concluded that no exclusion could lead to long-term vehicles seating.
The responsibility for this is to take the city as a road construction carrier.
Consequently, the reconstruction could lead to debt disputes.
Since both the wooden departure and the deflection were working in the current construction state, it was not supposed to agree to the reconstruction of the rail transition, the hare argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other crossways, because the centre of the stop is directly at the centre, with which a good visibility connection exists.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked off at this point so far that no collision threatens.
Most of them were refused to reconcile the reconstruction of this railroad as the city of Schiltach had to "bath the problem with seating vehicles", so the councils as the trains could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed.
As a problem, the body considers the reconstructions at the "Four Heubach" and "Four Kuhbach" lines for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1000 planets with other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of these lives, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Do you want to search for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, after earth-like planets, may explore outdoor life?
These questions are just addressing the responsible of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research decisive.
The food for such "L-missions" is approximately a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September in Paris, the elites of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them have now come to the closer choice.
A number of bodies examined the proposals, followed by researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
Totally four major questions have been selected by the Esa, on which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still lying in speaking darkness.
A big infrarot elescope in all could pass through this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with the 500 already known planetary systems in our closer environment being examined more precisely.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could form earthly planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and so search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered as an indication of biological activity.
How does the sun system work?
Finally, this question should also be given information about the conditions for the development of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particulate radiation from it to the planet system.
In our solar system, these events can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (where the budget is about a half billion euros) for this question.
The Sun will start 2017 and carefully observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to figure out the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three total L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sonde "Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer" is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icely moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world room offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and so investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also variations that could show the physics the way to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How has the universe been created and what does it consist of?
13,7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
Besides the violent matter, from the stars, planets and lives like us, there are dark matters whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
Until now, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second breakdown parts of the Urknall, nor from which dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M-M-Mission, whose start is intended for 2020.
With a special telescope, the Sonde is intended to examine the distribution of matters in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus allowing conclusions on the nature of dark material and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances for an authorisation as a L-Mission are, according to many experts "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
These include physical changes in the structure of space, which Albert Einstein had foretold nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could create this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides for one of two or three sins detectors that are stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also demonstrate gravity waves created at the Urknall and thus deliver new knowledge of the development of the cosmos.
Four further proposals continue to compete about the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to discover and investigate earthly planets.
Among other proposals for sampling back transport from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids and for sun-physics are already excreted.
Snowden will be ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has explained that he is ready to travel to Berlin and pronounce before the German Federal Day when the US National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not answer their activities.
The German parliamentary Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum was received to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Söbele, it says: “Even if the result of my efforts proved to be positive, my government continues to deal with a different opinion as a fraud and attempts to criminalize political opinions with a threat that is not possible to defend.”
But saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The accusation raised by the Ministry of Justice includes spionage and stealing of state ownership.
The German interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to allow that.”
The relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard the phone of Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who is chairing the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, stated that it was to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this could be "without threatening him and ruining the relationships with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter-feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden goes out in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, then the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “hearted and persecution campaign” that displaced him from his home.
However, it is affected by the global response to "my act of political opinion".
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians – including in the United States – have called the discoveries on an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a service for the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines raises charges for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to break handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of hand bags and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was to read that passengers should keep the whole dosage.
The new fee applies to hand bags in the luggage above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars were paid for travellers who only paid at the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines started to demand fees for the first and second surrendered baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to cope with them have therefore stopped as much as possible in the hand bags, resulting in the frequent overfill of baggage bags over the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said, at the new fee it isn't really about destining money.
It's about the most faithful customers of frontiers who had clearly expressed that it's going to be more and more difficult to find space in the field over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage free of charge at the frontier flight, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they could go to flight.
The new hand baggage fee of frontier enters into force only in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often swallow over baggage supplements and other fees, but airlines would like to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the baggage would cost money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it.
Many at the Wall Street view the new baggage fees as signs for airlines to take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most of them leave the fingers of fees for hand bags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for handbags and later allgiant Air, also a cheap pilot, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully pursues the additional fees.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand baggage fee of Spirit is spending 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently fled with spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the flight stage if passengers were faced with the unusual handbag fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most wealthy I experienced in my course in the aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth nozzles and handsome discussions at the flight climb.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as smeered.”
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole dosage and be filled with coffee free of charge.
Water continues to be free.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to demand money for refresh drinks in 2008, but this returned seven months later after passengers had been complained and no other large society had been pursued.
Frontier's step to raise fees for the hand bag if passengers do not buy directly at the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers for direct purchase with them instead of through an online travel office.
However, frontiers have gone most in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half so many miles in the booking of an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight routes.
Consequently, a flight booked by a third party with a frontier over 1,000 miles, customers will bring only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve on the website of Frontier places only for direct purchase.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The redemption decreased by 9 per cent, and the air capacity decreased almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent group, the Republic Airways Holdings Inc...
Republic has tried to handle the finances of frontiers in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman's premiere this year in the Evangelical Church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipality house was "Speakwords from the Bible" and "Sprekings from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church community Council, went into a lecture after breakfast on the Bible’s words.
"Specifics contain life-widths, regulations or warnings," she explained.
It compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the importance.
She called words such as: "Wait the eye of wood, as shots fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, the Lord's Hiss is in the sleep, wash his hands into innocentness.
Many times the referent also advised her listeners, which word it was.
The Middle Ages’ Appropriations adopted the church parrot Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something obscured.
It explained the importance and origin of the speech applications that she called "bridges in the past".
At the end, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously written before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the Mayer's candidate Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for uneducated tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake Plate, the people start a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men, who are already working as uneducated in the industry, will be qualified to professionals for hotels and hospitals over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert by the Work Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefit is widespread: participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be able to get trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and hostels, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project is also involved in the Industrial and Trade Chambers of Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Guests Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that a "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The treasureful National Security Agency declared late Friday, a mistake has made its public website a few hours lame and not hacker as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable tonight for a few hours, as during a planned update, an internal error occurred”, explained the spionage agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outcome was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
In the past, a NSA speaker had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, as the speaker says.
At least one group of hacktivists took advantage of having lamed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be overflowed with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site is interrupted.
Cyber tactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now found in the light of the public and sees the discoveries known in recent months about its extended monitoring programme in the country and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen and published by the desillusionated former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversials around the secret service fired initial speculations about the result of a targeted cyper operation today.
The number of people without job in October is slightly decreased by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, vice-president of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have responded to settings so far.
One reason for this is according to Felder-bauer: "We have hardly expertise in craft, health and old care."
Annual periods have also returned from September to the job offers for staff in the hotel and guest rooms business.
In the middle of December, the winter season begins there.
The whole background report for this is available in the Allgueer advertisement sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Wine penalties at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in net gain after being under pressure by declined orders and deliveries in third quarter aircraft and contracting problems in the railway party.
Bombardier with seat in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information about whether the plane could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambiguous timetable next September.
On the virgin flight of the test plane one and a half months ago, only three further starts have been followed, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course crash of more than eight percent at Toronto’s stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyzed at the National Bank Financial on Thursday, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector perform" in order to ensure that the share in the next one to two quarters has a limited price potential.
“It was expected to be more weak delivery rates in airplanes, but we are very disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer’s letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program is advanced.
However, if no new orders are made available in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries airline can cater the company into the lower market segment dominated by Boeing and Airbus at the moment.
The first test plane was presented in March of the public and fled for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, to date, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and wishing to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new air carrier are appropriate.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, business management also insured analysts and media that the programme was in the agenda.
“The test plane has no longer remained on the ground than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the standing time of the plane, soil tests and software updates had been applied.
Each manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, whatever we have done.
This is happening throughout the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was called from the company side.
However, analyzers remain skeptical whether 12 months after the first customer's virgin flight can take a plane of the CSeries.
Bombardier explained that it verifies the plan for in-service (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The slow advances of the flight tests – even if they seem to be consistent with the internal planning of Bombardiers – strengthen our view that the entry into the first quarter of 2015 is moving," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The turnover was low and decreased from 4.1 billion dollars to 4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a fall of 57 last year.
The net adjustments fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The contract stock in the air and space partners was $32.9 billion on September 30 and was unchanged compared to December 31th.
“In the area of air and space, the results were within the framework of our requirements, but the low intake of contracts and the market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The sales in the air and space park fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway producer, announced that the turnover in this sphere has increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport couple was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by the problems of settlement in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier Action gave up 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after also announced that the Google Finance Manager Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
The Brazilian Embra SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10% decrease in quarterly profit on Thursday.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss from police investigation, must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpooler Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be discovered, was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensible information on investigations about his drug trafficking activities after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer praised by criminals with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a former drug procedure.
Officers observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire, while it was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer.
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after tests had found tracks of cocaine in his hair, on his pocket and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to provide unauthorised information about the arrest of two men in order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of home searches at the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200 000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be public.
Today, ittta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and condemned at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two points of charge because of the disability of justice.
He confessed the possession of cocaine during a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's waste tone.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the dinner at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between them.
For the court it was known that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests of drugs of class A had been discovered in its hair, pocket and credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but dismissed taking cocaine and said that he spoke to the discouraged dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussion was subject to the "Advocate Secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his pocket and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair sample.
He claimed, at police interrogation, that he would call him at home for legal matters, both under his private address and at the workplace.
For the court he was known that he had called on important actors of drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
State lawyer Anne Whyte said: “A criminal law lawyer should know better than all others that you do not break the law.”
Thista is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defense, since he has been excessively admitted to certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted against police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his professional status in procurement.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta revealed every mistake and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to provide information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Lord Ditta has done the step from a criminal defense to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependency led to a hopeless compromise and made it convenient for the motive leaders of organised crimes, who were responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence.
Ditta has left this confidence and is trying to disappear behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals before court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you before court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty and thirty others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a range of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations of his 160-year-old existence, the Dunningen Song Kranz will embrace two services with the "German Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which the viewers enthusiasmed this spring this year, the song crown will reach two services with the performance of the German Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 on the evening feet in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10th, at the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the development.
The fair is listed in the context of the service, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the blazer group of the musical club Frohsinn teethbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis weakens confidence
For example, with the elections to the Pfarrgemeinderate 2015, the Seal Care Unit of Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish menat for all six priests.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is to the parishes to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticity to the new one weighs hastily, but in the face of a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the priesthood, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the sailing care team were sufficient.
The Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the newly adopted directives for seal-care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a church community forms a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish menat and a foundation council in which the priest's power is represented.
At least two elected members of each parish shall be represented in which six parishes are formed locally so-called communal teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
In the case of the finances of the individual parishes, there was a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected funds are maintained in the priesthoods.
On the other hand, the obligations are transferred to the general community.
Just in terms of the large investments planned, whose obligation then meets all the parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, only projects that could be managed by individual priests alone were invested," relatively Haslachs Prime Ministerates Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five priests painted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Sail Care Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had taken the task of 2006, "Become one, stay five" and had to find out that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher’s Seal Care Unit were then involved in answering the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish congregation and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concrete at further meetings and will be adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the priest-maintendent Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the director of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, compared to the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euros additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This turnover is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large power stations.
These include the additional costs arising from the energy change, which they can raise through a turnover over the electricity price.
The city works of Pfullendorf form the last joint in this chain.
As Jörg-Arne Bias reports, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher conversion in its forecasts.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out of an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number would be rather close to the 2 cents.
Example on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a sample just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
What then do you do - ride at red?
If a affected person has long enough waiting for a red amp and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgarter lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adapted", which could be different from case to case.
Becker is advised to endure at least five minutes before a disturbance of the ample should be taken.
However, those who continue the ride despite red lights must be clear that he has the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who are tolerated less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had ignored the amp and had to be responsible for a negligible red light violation.
Because the amp was not defective, but a little later jumped to green.
A driving ban remained for him because of the particular situation - but not the penalty.
The municipality council is pleased with solid households
Whenever it comes to municipal meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have not known the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked in this sense as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual account.
As Andrea Rothsund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget also amounts to around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
The surplus should be mainly higher commercial tax revenue and the municipality share of income tax.
The capital budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher inclusion from the administrative budget," says Rothsund.
Since investments have been made less than planned in the 2012 financial year, deposits have also fallen higher.
Totally, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.2 million euros to total 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothsund and her team for the good work.
"So a work is not just shaking out of the arch," praised Gerster with a view to the annual account.
He and the municipal councils were evidently pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradox, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive.
Through the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to avoid high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, the country has often reduced subsidies.
There are conditions for these grants from different compensations.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities, which apply for grants, must provide certain altitudes.
"We must look at the issue of lifting sets, as in the coming years we would like to invest for which we would like grants," announced Gerster in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years of singer, Hubert Wermter's history is at Cäcilia's men's singer almost twice as long as the Herbsfest, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on the stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing union.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the probably more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
In the association, Wermter was also active, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his engagement and association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Referent in order of the Cäcilia Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, submitted him - since the choir is a church chor - a document of the bond and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the certificate of the German Core Association as well as a graved tentant.
In addition to honor, the 31th Herbst festival went into usual railways: MGV Betra, the Song Crown Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the fullmaringer had loaded a bunte mix of different chores and song styles, which the about 400 visitors were interviewing.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with stunning songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lucky, your brothers".
Your honourable singer Hubert Wermter prepared them to honor a little bit more - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singer Betra also sang classic choirs like "Jägerwerbs" by Julius Wingert, "Wit, far away" from Hubert Goisern and the people's song "When you go through the valley".
The song crane of Salzstetten provided with his mixed chor and his female group - the "Impulsor" - for the female rate of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the neapolitan folk-like "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also reigned in foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back to home, where the Fullmaringer Musical Association offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the kids there was a small subprogram - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore stolelsteim, a casperl theater and read a few stories that the kids worked well on lunch.
Children's dreams become true
The children's gardens and children's daily places in the customs sector receive post in these days.
The Black Forest Bote wants to support the facilities in cooperation with the building house and the sparekasse Toldernalb in the realisation of their construction and beauty wishes.
Does the children's garden have a new sandbox?
As part of the action, all children's gardens, children's daily places and children's crusts can be taken from the entire customs office.
If you have a construction or beauty wish for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest Boats.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Children's garden building.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus und Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all shipments.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be to realise with construction materials of maximum EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner itself needs to provide for many pleasant building helpers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the sparekasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered in the children's garden on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the teachers and children themselves.
Kenian press disturbs about controversial media law
"We are in a distressing situation and we may ask ourselves: What does the Parliament think is going to dismant the legal independence tomorrow?" it was read in the newspaper that does not think the draft law is constitutional.
“The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, manager of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites Kenyas.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be overtaken, because it is an extended arm of government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and send back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government was taking the new law “the media effectively into a wrath.” On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered “a heavy struggle” and called the draft as“draconic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the post-ahead of the attacks by armed Islamists on the West Gate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media raised the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras to be seen as the units sent to the Tatort reportedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded to the submission of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the predecession was withdrawn after a call of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be filled with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillings and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to take possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “because a single punishment can push most radio broadcasters into the bankruptcy”.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive effect on the ones that are described by the "leavenly blogosphere" of Kenya.
If they break the media for silence, politicians could do whatever they want.
“No one will ever experience it," said Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who calls the Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left over themselves, they lead the country into the bankrupt and us back to the time of the hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public concerns in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and to re-establish their due wages of about 532 000 shilling tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
The official dedication celebration for the art racial sports site despite the cold weather and the rain, was not inclined in the importance of the city and the football club.
A more pleasant celebrations hour had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus all those who came without a rainscreen or could not keep one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who embraced the festival act, just like some speakers.
Nass also became the FC Chairman of Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was given to all the leader Walter Klumpp, who committed a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, to the municipality council, to the participating companies and association members.
In particular, Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rough retirers moved 400 square meters of patches for the new paths.
This remarkable honorable commitment was also worthy of the country-day member Karl Rombach.
Other greetings spoke for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the District Chairman of the Southbad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, announced a donation for the Youth Department of the Club.
Citizen Klumpp reminded that in spring and autumn, ever-recovering white-related influences were added to the original racing site so that it could not be played.
There were the first considerations to solve the problem already 15 years ago when the construction of a third place at the ground of the football club or at the real school at Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came to the construction of a artificial sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were launched two years ago when the FC took over the shelves in heritage, invoked a cost of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the space and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros.
The construction of the 68 times 108 metres large artificial grass space took place on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of Earth were deducted, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike stroke.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and legal issues.
To this end, the responsible working group gathered in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, parliamentary control and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Working Group also wanted to continue their discussions.
This should be the subject of double citizenship in which both sides have opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda on this Friday, the SPD undermined its no to a car wall required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for multilingual and thus ecologically contraproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened roads on land roads, which are already uncertain.
In addition, the introduction of a wall for all cars would only be a first step from view of Pronolds.
"The risk is that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later time," he said.

Vienna Airport provides passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Throughstanding like this will no longer be available at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
Most of the speakers are dropped by this - the noise gel is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the objective of this innovation.
As airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of transgressions of individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoned, among other things, on the curious calls.
By the decline of these transgressions - averaged on one day about 200 personal calls by the speakers - it is intended to go quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual penalties have been relatively little observed, but at the same time all other information on changed flight rises or departure times are a little less than this," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio broadcaster.

Overview of milk and egg alternates
Vegane nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Poored tofu with plant sauce is, for example, a quarker set.
Others call the Vegetarian Federation for the World Vegetary Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives at the time of the World Vegetarian Day on November 1st:
Pure plant margins are a good alternative to butter, yogurt lets replace with sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soja, harbour, mandel or rice milk can be used.
Remarkable plant sauces resettle conventional stroke.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half-pressed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or an apple of lemon seed painted plus three dining apple of water is suitable for this.
Locker will be tea instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a target apple of back powder, a dining apple of food strength and three dining apples of mineral water.
But also 50 grams Sojajoghurt or Seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely plant.
No sleep in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest gymnasium met the U.S. Great City of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached to foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which is a special race in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but trust the motto "The city is not sleeping" was decided on the day on the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the freedom statue could be reached with a ferry and climbed to foot.
Afterwards, the financial centre around the Wall Street went to the Memorial of September 11th.
On the third day, students from the 373 metres high view platform of the Empire State Building could win an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets over the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay shortly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their guest families and experienced the school day at the Weymouth High School.
This year also a Hubertus fair is celebrated on the day of the Holy Hubertos in the Church of St. Marien at Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the story of a fairly unreasonable hunter that was converted by a vision and later appointed as the Bishop of Kleinich.
The Jagdhorn blazer group of the Jagdreter Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth musiced on Parforce horns (Naturhorns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The leaves wear riding clothes because they mostly accompany riders, horses and dogs on sleep hunting musically.
The festival fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The new designed opslag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of visiting the like-named café at the opslag in the city of Kleve in the vicinity of the Rhein-Waal University, it must not stay at the pure Déjà Vu feel.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has just this aim: to make a real stay not only thankful, but handfast always recursive.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look into the inner life at the opslag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The high-modern but not cool café ambient looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team convenes with the founders Mirjam van der Stellt and Daniel Büttner at the top the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the delicious cafes at the lookup as a gastronomen: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
The sympathic café lovers hope more audience from moving to Kleve to the opslag.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we have no specific target group," Daniel Büttner stressed.
Instead, the two of them want to respond to young students as well as to seniors and all age classes.
Apropos Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathic owner couple is behind the coffee genus.
Enjoys the fragrance of hot bread in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso-Fan and Mirjam van der Stellt the Cappuccino drinker.
"For that a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the port feast was rather out there - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the night of the ringel.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everybody's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a prominent fan of event evening, "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always talk to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be more the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the entire normal operation as little as possible."
Should be: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful environment at the lookup in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomy miles.
To the joy of many clevers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wifes, were happy to come.
In the association room of the hostel "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious relationship in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate solidarity to make honor.
The special award "Singers of the Year" was this time the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written much for us, but also turned some round for us, for our heartfelt thanks," says the Chairman of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the appearances and choir samples through activity strokes went to the choir director Dieter Schulze this year with 44 participants, followed by the honourable President Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Space five occupied notekeeping Artur Brückner.
A special thanksgiving directed the board to the team of associations Ange Pier Ribbert, who once more had taubed a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets his regular chore samples on Tuesday at 19.45 p.m.
"New song-joyed voices are welcome at any time," says Schlotmann.
The UN announces new targets in combating poverty
The United Nations start immediately with the development of a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Objectives for Poverty fighting 12 years ago.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro at the evening, Australian diplomas played a key role in the pre-establishment of sustainable development targets, which would replace the Millennium targets that end in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world policy leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to adopt a process to be agreed with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the 2015 framework for development.
I will not avoid trying to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the Millennium targets."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superligist continues to be a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon doesn't have any doubts about that.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Still, I hope we'll finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga-Reserve from Fredenbeck hasn't eliminated trees at the moment, Malmon is warning the graphic finger in advance.
Many players have been trained in the A youth myself.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is possible to wait for then to be reinforced from the first," the SG Coach explains.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must in any event increase compared to the previous appearances.
In front of all things in the covering work and in the shift game, it was last huge.
The risk recovery must definitely be improved.
Therefore, I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short break.
Safety concerns in Mozambique are growing in the light of conflicts between influenceful individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the State and the first President of Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the entry "We demand security" into Portuguese and joined the amount on Thursday at the capital independence.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was first supported by White Government Rhodesia and later the South African apartheid government in trying to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became a opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a grown conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and locals have disturbed.
For the rapidly growing economy there is a lot ongoing, because the discovery of huge gas events before the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The governing Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, a traditional Highburg Renamos on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speaker to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collapses and accuses the organisation to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has attempted to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a loser who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
Against the FT, he explained that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have helped little to add the tensions fired by a number of collisions this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collapse the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, Doctor at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
No one of them is good in negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who urges election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos electoral success since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the President's office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear about what capacity Renamo has, but she has made upset attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most fights took place in the Province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, uses the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has further increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, dramatic progress in development and a recent elimination wave.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again and useable streets," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “apposes for life”, says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance against smart tricks” and the Artus-Ling shows how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “as far too wild, too busy and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools”, why Crossley-Holland planned for an "pleasant selection" of old-right works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been proposing this plan for 20 years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are "overdue-doctors" children would be "closed complete" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "smartly".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo Saxony and was the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intents, but you should keep it in the background as possible.”
The greatest difference between a adult author who writes for adults and a author who writes for children is the need to communicate hope.
Not all needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be subtle, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjakob relocated in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his age rest seat in Haslach, and his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many viewers were enthusiastic with the very short-term scene game.
From the arrival of the honourable citizenship to his death, the actuator and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which was a great appreciation under Cornelia people's government.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and crossed periods from youth to nearing pension.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role than a great son of the city.
Stelecht took the two-sounder and "Black Forests Fweissen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received from the audience with a lot of applause, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understanded it incredibly well to put itself into the role of the sister and gave her unpleasant life in Mimic and Gestic.
Between the individual play scenes, Mühlenbach's farmer chapel played suitablely selected music pieces and thus rounded off the performance.
For the award of the honourable citizens' dignity, then Haslach's Mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honor, which, in the representation of the then official owner Hättich, together with a part of the City Council, was awaited.
Their waiting then made the three king-singers that led Hansjakob to the call: "Ah, as beautiful, there will be again youth reminders at my own three-quarters time."
With her song "O Jesulein" they rejoiced the audience in the courtyard as well as the Storchentag kids with their loud "Out, out."
His criticism on the official church had then expressed Hansjakob the same as his concerns about the emergences of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homeroom, behind his grave chapel on the fire at the courtyards, he found his resting place.
"A distressed spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
Many applause and many praiseful words were found by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows
The chances for the League remaining of the sporty declined Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard process, then there is a smaller competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers fails to apply for a possible rear space.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said Ex-National Player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 has set up the concept of a professional lub in the Hansestadt.
However, a first breath was not to learn from Ludwigsburg.
"We weren't busy with the wildcard process as long as it was not found that Düsseldorf did not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By May 23th, Supper Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitrary court and demonstrate its economic state of the Bundesliga.
However, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arrival court is the last instance.

Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in its Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal General Attorney may either ask questions in writing or personally address 30-year-olds in Russia.
This reported to the Interfax Agency, on the basis of a call for unprecedented circles familiar with the situation.
A question like this could be explained in the intergovernmental context, it said.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is allies of the United States, Snowden threatens the delivery there, it continued

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has a number of irons in fire at the location.
In addition to the carbon import, Rhenus Midgard sets out, among other things, wind plants logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camping lot before the deck.
Distribute or recharge the coal here, if necessary, with two huge blue shields and backloaders.
For each movement of the envelope devices, a sharp alarm sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is far to hear - and so there were some complaints from people from the city's order.
He takes the complaints very serious and therefore has contacted the concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, we are now keeping the warning signals with technical measures less frequently.
He also sets up the open dialogue with the neighbours in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has some more in front of the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on carbon imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres deepened Lievane form terminal can be completed here for a long time.
"This year we want to knock the 3-Million tonnes brand at the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the network, then 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year are realistic.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not decay huge optimism in the FC Bayern Munich basketballers.
"Nobody can prohibit us from believing to win against the best team of Europe in the past two years," the Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic was balanced after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title-defense Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Also in Munich there is basketball!
During their first third appearance in the European king's class, the coins sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not explained enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the piece of art to turn a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end into a leadership before Piräus gave a turn to the game again.
"We have been incredibly fighting back against the two-fold Euroleague champion, but then made lightly mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful advertisers of the coins who had celebrated significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish tracker targetona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: about a hundred years ago, the Varietekunst Frank Fay, who worked as Conférencier at the Palace Theatre at the Broadway, began to tell the amount of jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years Fays innovation was expanded, as last on the New York Comedy Festival.
This year the festival celebrates his 10-year anniversary with over 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were sometime too well known to come up in a club," said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are appearances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as of "Stand Up for Heroes", a annual music and comedy benefiz event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of the Comedy has grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known on rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable TV (the ironic-slepping fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although she is the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Croll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on Rassenthemen W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American Comedy.
One of the largest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but developed to a viewed TV and film director and an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast with the title “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV country.
The meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfies with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows satisfaction with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN powers and Germany.
"Now after years you have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clear the differences in the late years," said Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear manager is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids kill game chambers with Machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunting.
With Machets and knives they armed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a fountain, reported the "El País" newspaper on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a worker district before their apartments.
The body was found next night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the disciple who had taken them should say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl before the police described the tatherway without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys granted the definitive killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder named a rivality in football game.
He was provisionally submitted to a psychiatric youth institute.
Holder must go to prison
Due to exploitation of human trafficking, penalty, threat, injury and dangerous injury, the country court has constant sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as doorsteher after two operations in Afghanistan, gave a consensus in the context of a process agreement.
Therefore, in five cases, he met women through Internet or telephone contacts that he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He took up opposition with violence and threats.
The revenue of the women who purchased him for some years he received.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he interrupted women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated the women, he brought them into various board cells in the southwest.
There he allowed them partly to monitor their revenue.
First, before the court, the complainant claimed that he suffered under a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatric expert raised great doubts about the psychic restriction and thus proved to a limited debtability, the 33-year-old gave a comprehensive consciousness.
The court had no more to understand the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, after an initial advertisement by telephone monitoring measures, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be determined.
The negotiated conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later admissions, the damaged ones would have confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness, one of the women in the whole body had discovered blue spots, has not made any statement until today.
It is "a totally broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this meteoric as normal.
The complainant regreted his behavior yesterday.
"He dissolved himself from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per Barrel
The oil price also fell further on Friday after concerns about a high offer overestimated a report that increases in China's energy hungry production sector.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December had fallen in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large raw oil offer has charged the prices in the past weeks.
On Wednesday, the United States Energy Ministry declared that the US offer increased by 4.1 million Barrel last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million Barrel.
However, on Friday there was evidence of a stronger demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the variety Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by US refinery, fell at ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-free directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a federal procurement court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-free program (the "keep-up and search") of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until the city was called.
The judge had judged in August, the city infringed the constitution with the way the program is implemented for the stopping and questioning of persons.
The city initiated a call against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures, including the decision to establish a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the required suspension.
The procedural report explained that the judge must be disconnected from the case, since it has injured the Code of Conduct for American Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had judged, police officers injured the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they in an inappropriate way call black and Latin American men with the stop-and-free program into the shower.
It appointed an external body for monitoring the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in four-years where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared ready to stop the practice of storage of names and addresses of persons who were released after a police control.
An oral negotiation for calling the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-free technique has been criticised by a number of civil rights officers.
Controls of this kind have been available for decades in different forms, but the number of checks recorded during the official time of the parteilosian Mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to a constant height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were complaints that developed into a collective complaint.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD stop-and-free program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police and influence the way other police authorities use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would dampen the police morality, but not the crime; also would waste money and the broader problem of a police which is under pressure after the decline of thousands of posts over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-free praxis that was constitutional, but only reforming the type of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the Happy of the Dreaming Chambers
Happy is an oase that can reach only dreaming chambers
With this indication, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association of helping hands.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, another collaboration was developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the site on several trips.
During the speech, pictures of the entrances on a large canvas were shown, so the guests of the anniversary event could make an image of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plan to operate in advisory function, according to Henne.
In 2008, the roomei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital station in Socogim, an elendsviertel on the edge of the capital, in the record period of almost a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, so Henne, for example, disappearance against burn-out.
Due to the political disruptions in the country, it was not possible to make as many travels as planned, but for this, many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, so in March this year medical devices, medicines, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundantly local colorite by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes rebuilt to the mobile cemetery, and depicting the experiences of the family home musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritania journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of audit as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans to control a budget through the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it's not far to Africa.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word Publisher Andy Coulson claimed that “Telephone-Hacking, Monitoring and Confrontation” was attempting to confirm a wrong tip about a business of Charles Clarke, then.
In May 2005, lawyer Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court of Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false reputation that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special consultant” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the state lawyer, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who is standing before the apartment of people and hoping to capture them on fresh deeds, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said, NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the monitoring, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disturbs this, but we say, “And if he knew of it.”
Anniversaries about an affair Clarkes were first absorbed by the feature editorial of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don't waste your time, she's with Charles.”
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the researchers ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, explained Edis.
In the meantime, the former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as the former Minister of Inner Affairs, David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the sworns heard that Coulson Blunkett was confronted with a married woman because of an affair when he was lying to the fellow-man Rebekah Brooks, who had then been married.
Coulson and Brooks struggle to have sworn with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually take the first line since 1972.
A lighting meeting ends without results.
In the conflict about the rich tax, the government and the Profi-Fussball in France have manoeuvred into a sackgasse after a failure.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in Paris' Élysée Palast Association and Association representatives and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to redeem the Fussball from the planned 75% levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The Streik announced for the end of November will now be carried out, the Chief Association of Proficlubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The play days in the League 1 and the League 2 will therefore fall from 29 November to 2 December.
Songs: No absolute protection possible
"We want to integrate the inhabitants early in planning," opens Mayor Jens Häußler the Citizen Information Event on the High Water Protection Concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had come to the municipality hall in order to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Heusler stated: "The final decisions will be taken by the members of the Board of Municipalities."
The highwater, which was unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been a decisive event that raised the question of protection for the future, says Häußler.
A river area survey had been carried out with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high-water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection as much as possible of the built land is the goal," says Huusler.
Based on this, the planning of protection against a German weather service is statistically every 100 years of expectation of high water.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% grant.
In sections, this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masss that led to significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 matched an 1000-year high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement we can achieve," says Huusler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereas the municipality can expect some 70 percent of national grants.
Hessers, however, pointed out that there is only support if a overall concept is implemented.
This is why the municipality is required for the involvement of citizens.
A planned and approved procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with the implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has been presented in the municipal council last week (we have reported) local measures in the accession of the flush Irm from the family home valley.
Following the presentation of the high-water protection concept, participants used the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dumbs and backing pools were planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the responsible engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is considered to be to find the most economic solution, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unfortunately, even during normal rainstorms, there was an overload of the channel network in the old town.
The problem is familiar with administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Hessers, however, pointed out that the directives for channel systems are other than those for high water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be undertaken.
The dimensionation of the wastewater channels would swallow millions.
Severe injuries after collapse
During the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were severely injured at a frontal confrontation on the country road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but could not say to the accident.
However, there are various statements of witnesses that should be evaluated.
Festival is that the 19-year-old linkrin of a VW golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, whereas the woman was so hard sticked that the fire war needed just half an hour to release her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accident was first unclear.
Both disadvantages came into nearby hospitals.
The distance remained locked in about two hours.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysic, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the relativeship in the outermost: the stirring eyes, the bart, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets, who are quite alike in their own country.
Some titles appeared in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans box with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with Paranoia, security assault and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had added drugs to his brain.
He realized, early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine, the Creator of his Creator.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" comes from the year 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is here developed the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", which is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In the Dicks world, which is like our horrible, mutants look forward to the future - and the police accept.
"We convene individuals who have not violated any law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And "In our society there are no sword criminals, for this we have a prison camp full of pessubreakers." They read Time streams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought into reality.
Dicken Story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the audience of the NSA.
Analysis of the attack: Obama's Drohnen philosophy and praxis also works.
But Dicks Story's not finished yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more violent division, the military controls everyday life - and what's left by the state.
Then the guardian himself is monitored and transmitted to a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It finds out his own conditions.
Don't just buy mistakes and victims but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says always to get closer to the truth.
Seafare about Merkel in Russia
The former US Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in its Russian asylum in the US-safe vacation about Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Advocate Authority could either ask questions in writing or personally address 30-year-olds in Russia, the Agency reported Interfax.
Before yesterday, the Green-Bundesday member Hans-Christian Ströbele had hit Snowden in Moscow as the first German politician in Moscow to talk to him about the business.
Increase NSA detections Company paranoia for State Monitoring
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter fled deeply over the US Consulat in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
Instructed by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Service, it should photograph the roof of the US external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the United States did not use any ways of foreign spionage, “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in order of U.S. companies so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or profits.”
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the only employee of Whistleblower, with the publication of his fillhorn to US-American surveillance secrets, has no longer been sure that European governments and business heads can take the director at the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and provided data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company's paranoia for government surveillance has brought to a new climax.
The phase to overflow brought the detection that the office of Kanzler Angela Merkels had been captured for the past 10 years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can show, then business leaders are certainly also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US home services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now constituted almost the same risk as China when it was about industrial spionage and data stealing, such a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents covered by Snowden there has not yet been evidence that the United States has transmitted the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concerns about the lack of certain IT and Internet possibilities and to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Federal Day, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“This does not work”, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal through cars to agriculture.
Everything to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, extensive and technical refinances of the US spionage authorities discovered by Snowden have shocked companies who had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to judicial law and therefore potentially threatened.
According to an enquiry conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after the discovery of the U.S. data mining activities with a price of about ten percent of non-US membership plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, vice-president of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who weren't there a year ago – she is: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that these are physically in this legal area?”
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew at all, namely, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at any price.
That economic spying takes place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans spionate us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of enterprises usually does not praise about the counter-actions that have been taken, because this brings attackers advantages.
In large companies employees have long been convinced that taking a free USB stick on a fair or unwaited leave of a laptop in the hotel room is not advised to be readily said.
Ulrich Hackberk, CEO of Auto Manufacturer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid handys when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective Nische.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to protect business secrets effectively from unauthorised access”, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warns its own companies from economic spionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia and Israel were assigned to two of the countries behind China who served to purchase economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it was about economic spying, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French Interior Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very precisely that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spionate their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery trip that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important suppliers around a wedding.
One trend: The Retro look has been holding in again.
This starts at the wedding clothes.
White is Must, best covered or in cream.
Before then, the many rushed and climbed clothes are closed, often with a sludge, backwards they go down the back and often end in a trap.
However, since the spirits are divorced, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house of clothing garbage.
In men the dress dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be selected cream coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, was explained.
Smoothless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambient should be special.
Here the domain made attention to their own offer in the Remise.
Anyone who wants to run with the couch has an offer for the Uwe Link.
"But kittings are also popular for boy celebrations," he says.
Romantics are also asked for invitation cards, flower events and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion, the "After-Wedding Photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfall, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magic, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For a repeated time, the dogfriends of Bitz were successful on a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his hündin Sandy, he reached 94 points in the class beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley, he brought it to place at 87 points twelve.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in class 1, set out the critical views of the Performance Judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a collapsed ringermate in the turnhall of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, the family lawyer explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a upright mathematics behind the Tribüne in the school hall.
The research officers of the Lowndes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which doubts the family of the 17-year-old.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff followed it.
“They believe that it disobeys any logic, violates the laws of physics as well as the healthy human understanding," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is consumed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he commented.
On Thursday, US lawyer Michael Moore said that there will be a formal investigation to Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy pointed out that Johnson died from the consequences of a position-related disturbance.
A second autopsy, however, caused another death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation on Johnson's death, he will be assigned to the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in southern Georgias ordered that the authorities must release all the surveillance videos that the investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video records contained suggestions on how he died.
CDC publish allergic guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the management of food allergies of children at school.
These are the first such directives published by the US government, as the number of children with food allergies increases.
One of 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The Guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergic allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine prudent – the car injection of the brand EpiPen is most frequently used – to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The lawyers in the state have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more prudent.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: “It feels like something pressing my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it” or“My tongue cripples.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose “Smart unspecified”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genetics.
Newborns are no longer stare male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer need to explain sex to such children, but may indicate "undetermined" or "not defined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make excessive decisions regarding surgery for a sex assignment of newborns and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.
An intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I'll keep the flickery created by doctors stumbled and filled with herbs.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year will not come to the world as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group falling under the diagnosis “Sexual Differential Disorder” (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, thrombosses (eggs or flocks) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States are advised to use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if any, one decides for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “applies to a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent a ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not do so," he said.
You can make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the development of identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very precise.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people are different from transsexuals or transgeners, because their status is not related to sex but is subject to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics showed in a number of sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priorities of sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexuals and transgeners are exposed to in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Non-general boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australier Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "generalless" person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a "non-defined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German instructions will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of Interior.
In nearby France, sex homes are still controversial, so a news report to France 24.
In 2011, thousands of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "smart" theory should be removed from school books.
The US-American website Catholic Online also expressed itself against the German law, with the reason: “If the world is diverted into a new state where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone, she might find it better when babies are assigned a sex at birth.
“The parent is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female gender parts were called Hermaphrodites, following the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine considered the sex as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
However, in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubtful after now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he grows up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the midst of the 20th century, this was called a “psychiatric emergency”, said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who represented the view that the sex is formed.
He depicted the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental injuries – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and depicted a person as male or female.
But in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in a disguised circumcision, to cast the child completely and also to remove his heads and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he returned to male sex and married a woman.
With 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with Internet access, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, which are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author of Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-digit genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the Hoden were disposed of surgically just after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressive and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he turned back to male identity, received testosteron injections and left his breasts to be removed.
Through the operation, he has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organisation named Interface Project that intersexual people are considered normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the lawyers for Informed Choice in California, is concerned that the German law can “stimulate and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to grant a ‘not defined’ to the child,” she explained.
We fear that favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only imagine.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, for “it allows adults to recognize as a third sex”.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she explained.
The German law is about the assignment of birth.
This is not a fight to force young children at this time.
When they are mature, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual discrimination disturbance and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says, the German law “authorized” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD named complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe order of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the child psychiatrie.
Although she is infertile, it hopes to be able to get a child by adoption or by a parrot.
“The law gives parents space, which does not have to make decisions that have to be made overwhelmed," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to make different tests and to make things clear and give them time before they write “manly” or “wifely”.
In this way, everything is okay – you move the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's luck.
And you don't have to do a surgery that can't be undoed anymore.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are embarrassing because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is better suited to it – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shot of car
Unknown ones have injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt at shots from a car.
The actors were probably fired on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure gun to a group of children.
That's what the police shared in Castle.
The girl had easily been hurt on the left Wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car who had been in front of a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The actors also shot at a bus stop.
A disc was broken.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police detected it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspector Kempten can look back to a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called for two egg-going children, which were thrown against house-catches.
Since home owners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg residues, no damage would also have arisen.
In addition, some Sylvester balls were probably ignited in the city area, but there was no damage here.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his truck was integrated with closure and its bicycle blendings were exploited.
Until the police arrived, however, the man has discovered his cycling flows in the immediate vicinity of all, why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spinning?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spin at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spindle fobie, but the concern of not being able to handle the many stairs to the house and in the apartment, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty-five girl has had to learn in his own body, which means moving with disabled from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the theme 'Happy living in the age - What is the best way to live for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in the age," she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all dealing with the theme 'Wohnen in the age'.
Most people disappear it as long as it goes.
Old will be only the others," she says funny.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really big, you are thinking.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the inner architect presents 17 living models for self-defined living in the age.
"The way you choose your life is always an individual decision," she explains.
D i e solution does not give it for the age.
Even if you can provide the age rest in Toscana or Bretagne, you should always think that he can become sick.
And, "Without good knowledge of the country's language, you are also united in the Dolce Vita," the professional book author gives you to recall willingness to settle.
Their models include classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted retirement WG.
At the age, everybody has his tickets and Mackens
'For me, a living community wouldn't be anything', she meant with an eye twin.
Not even as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'On the age you just need your withdrawal rooms,' says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude that a senior community can function.
However, this must be done differently than in the classic students-WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest,' she thinks.
In this regard, at least it is not there alone in the capital of the country.
'The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the civil service life in the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people around the theme 'become older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions only in order to remain in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation Product Test.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are dealing with the age-right reconstruction of their house or apartment should first inform themselves carefully and not order the best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the age-right reconstruction.
Even in the housing, it becomes realised by somebody, and if it is only the toilet seat, the inner architecture is clearing up.
But not always the existing apartment can be transformed olderly and thus free of access, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to do Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift within the apartment, the staircased road to the door of the apartment would also be the far larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she grew more than before the spine on her door of apartment.
The United States wants Snowden to continue to pursue criminal law
The United States has not changed their attitude to the former U.S. public service employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be prompted to have transmitted secret information.
Therefore, he had to make himself a criminal procedure in the United States, said the speaker of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent comments of Snowden would not change anything.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Politics Hans-Christian Strobele had appealed to the United States not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in Ströbele's statements about a parliamentary, not the ones of a German government member.
Secret Servicesthüller Edward Snowden is essentially ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to explain his situation.
This has clarified the former NSA employee searched by the United States in a not addressed letter published by the Green Politicians Hans-Christian Strøbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to federal government, federal day and general lawyer.
The letter, after a translation made by Ströbele, has the following words:
To the Consultants
I was asked to write to you about your investigation on mass surveillance.
I'm Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I was witnessing systematic law breachs of my government, which caused me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw a serious and persistent hero that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying a temporary asylum which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the detection of a system of overall monitoring, which no one is responsible for, as a public service.
These spionage discoveries made many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the former misuse of public trust.
The benefit of society from these findings is increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchases were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts proved to be positive, my government Dennens continues to treat as a treacher and strives to criminalize political opinions and to complain.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will reject this absurd attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are under way, I will be able to take part in the responsible disclosure of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, adequately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.

Children's Garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's Mayer Michael Maier.
The former children's garden in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
At its recent meeting in the non-public part, the Municipal Council agreed to sell.
The building changed its owner to a "adapted" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were set up.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's garden.
The mayor is right that winterlings have given the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and therefore no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and riding the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Plastic concert at high summer temperatures
The musical club Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the hosthouse Hammer.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 a.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked all who had helped to manage the first musical hock successfully in this framework.
Report: Obama campaign planned to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have in secret considered to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The discovery is the most remarkable surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the book that will appear next and she reported on Thursday night that the President's top advisers had carried out “great group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011” in order to find out whether Obama's diverging hope of re-electing would look better when he let bids fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leaders of the campaign and of the White House, namely to measure the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, the effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former foreign minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest consultants of the President – including Daley, the former Championship leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leader of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was standing at the top of the efforts to exchange Biden despite its "one, personal relationship", before finally a decision was taken against such a shock after the data showed that the Candidature Clintons would "not significantly improve the opportunities of Obamas".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace bids with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
We have to recall that the President at that time had terrible survey values, so we thought, "For God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "required care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-electing significant efforts had been carried out to find out whether such a train would pay for the election tours.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something," explained Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his damal boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe that the President was “conscious of the possible change”, the former Staffman admitted that it was“possible” that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political prosecutions of Obama had reached the desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
"Certainly," answered Martin.
What happens with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the mail secret technically transposed in the design of the Internet service, similar to the conventional post?
The conception of early Internet services was in the foreground of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account the creation of a stable foundation for a listening-safe exchange of letters.
Consequently, a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open postal card rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's e-mail client or browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider used by Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The provider of the sender will normally check whether the mail leads to a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is a slanderous and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their coming holiday trips, Google can show related links to vacation offers.
Read also unknown people with the emails?
The probability that unauthorised persons read a mail is very low.
Theoretical, however, is this possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The criminal persecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to capture or note e-mails.
There are possible illegal outlook actions to do so.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
Using a OpenPGP standard encryption, an email can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to diminish the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that not even without any further knowledge can be found who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
For the most privately used mailboxes Yahoo and Google, according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make clear by Google.
Mother in the Forest worsened and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg smote a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to discard their pensions and care fees.
In order to get further pensions and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
First, he destroyed the death of 89-year-olds, then he put the money in for more than six and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Hence, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it found that the careful mother was no longer required medicines.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because the officials made this strange, they continued to determine.
It found out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an increase did not indicate any point for a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first lighting ice in the dark – using quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous leakage from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quallen and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the bright protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consuming with the tongue, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you leak, the better it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I'm Delicious”, says:“The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH value and the ice shines.
We tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever manufactured, because the quallent fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet cost me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for it.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leave gold.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is incredibly impossible because of the fraction of light caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists; but I guess we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualde produced by Chinese scientists artificially
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball-verbandsliga after six play days.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated last weekend of his first victory.
With this game the season begins new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," gives Ehlers a optimistic behavior.
Finally, with the exception of the long-term injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete frame available.
Even Daverden, like us, is on speed game.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
Firstly, however, it is important to increase in the cover, which has left everything other than a safe impression.
The Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can always happen in Derby.
Still, Panitz now wants to post in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windsuit, which is active with double playright at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game is supposed to stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweetness, stay late and clothe us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute my apartment from sweetness, and I think it will not do this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Resident Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the US $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year's exciting unleavened items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to hide in sexy clothes, they can now also embrace leaderous food such as pizza, Hamburger or carrots.
As regards men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk World Room Men will make it in the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexes.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not to my surprise alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pet animals, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As regards sweetness, we're not impressive.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year for it, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lutschers, Bonbons and rubber bears.
So good news for the US Department of Trade, 41 million people who go through the quarters with the words "Sweet or Saures".
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't make anything – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetween Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion maize grains.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spooks.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which remains in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States, which generate $500 million redemption, America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful pictures on which you just pink into the pockets and the friends put on Facebook where you don't get them back, and then one of the guys on which you stand, leave a comment as "nother face expression".
But let's finally come to the bulbs.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the big cherry baby when we were kids, and the cutting of a granule is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Happyly, the “Baby in Kürbis” turn started to thank Pinterest last year, so most of us have grown up to cutting the kürbis and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for granules, according to the US Census Bureau.
The granules, which are slowly rotten in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million pounds of granules were harvested this year.
If you want to point correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut something cool from their 921 kilos of heavy cherry.
Apartment fire in Helmbrecht: Rescue forces mountains cold body
The firearm had to pull out in the helm right late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of the court will catch on Friday fire in the night.
The rescue forces store a cold body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a cold body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrecht.
Whether it's about a inhabitant, it's still unclear, as a speaker of the police in Bayreuth said.
The late Thursday night it had burnt at the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm arrived, the flames were already hitting out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire earth has been damaged.
All other inhabitants had not been at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has started an open-label to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible parish deficit: The Evangelical Lutheran National Church Hannover calculates that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will half up to 2030 after this position.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily course itself.
With Burfien, for the first time the National Church has ordered a pastor in full place to enthusiasm young people for theology study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after abitur.
Burfien leads this to the process of decree: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the gentleman of my calendar and can put my focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be close to the people as a sailor.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely the free economy will pay more, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This happens to the young people today, not just about career, but about a sensible work.
According to the National Church, comprising three quarters of Niedersachsen, about 60 pastors are currently retired per year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In thin border areas such as the harz, the Emland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to arrange for young people, among other things, and invites prominent people who have studied theology.
The theology study offered a wide range of training.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find Rennsitze and Six Point Slots and a Free Speaking Facility.
The options range from increased brakes, a service package with the care of Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistics support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced riders, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as a reachable way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Rover and MSA and believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and to prepare new ones for the Strapas and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Watches – this becomes an entertaining mastership.
In addition, there is a day of training and testing at the Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire guard called to rescue a cave that was 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a rock break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a small traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the rock break in her miserable situation
Firefighters sailed down on rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire warrant managed to secure a cave that was fixed on a 15 meters high front in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belonged, came to the rock break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby back and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service.
They had desperately searched for their missing pants and published help calls in social networks when she had escaped after the small traffic accident into the stone breakdown.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walking walker, who carried out his dog, saw the threading Ruby on the 15 meters high piece in the rock break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and sailed off to the salvation of Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move muscle during her salvation – she was frozen as steep.
But now she's fine.
She then eated a few dog cooks.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a great luck."
It was the possibility that she was very severely hurt or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian, but nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “In view of salvation, it was anxiety.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue had become too large and it would have crashed, it would probably have crashed.
The fire Forces have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never made up Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
At an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the Pop Star said that she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old rocker at night, and that "he had baked me when I was 18 years old."
She added: “It's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he “cautically denied that he ever made approach trials at Katy Perry”.
The representative added: “It may be that she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest trip this year at the Rolling Stones tour.

George Kerevan: European deflection gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new horror history of independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for the EU membership.
This delivers the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a border secured with stachel wire along the Hadrian wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not matter in the tables.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States are frequently correcting their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a little consent against what you really want from the shots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so in the years that it is already like a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport controls” ends at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost when this old history is repeated.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European Pfeife?
Why do the London yoke exchange against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the large, after war fixed plan for Europe's association has been put into stock.
With the Euro-crisis, Europe's project has officially died.
All EU parties win on grounds that are EU-feends or want to throw the euro as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party could have founded alternatives for Germany – only this year – almost five million votes at the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively dismiss the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the stringent saving policy of Berlin and the European Central Bank in relation to the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by maintaining the common currency, many people have felt that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the excessive budget deficit of national governments – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, South Europe will be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany.
The only way is to shorten wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
A deep European productivity problem is behind the current food and monetary problems.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the cost of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the four-fold for gas compared to the United States.
This is a low cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All world wage statements do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed from cheap American skiing gas into the corner.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the EU's inevitable cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France viewed the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in chess and Paris raised with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris more than the gateway for political legitimation and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens judicial, EU-fenomenous Front National has just won a decisive turnover and thus referred the governing socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to avoid an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cutting off at these elections – and that is very good possible – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the not too far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (Souverian) nations' which favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distinguish from this project in the hope of grinding into the United States.
Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area, however, points out that the United Kingdom will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where is Scotland staying with all of that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can place where.
I suppose Scotland could go very well in a more delicate European union if we maintain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries that think similarly is easier in a non-federed Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to do it with Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is, notably, the most successful political movement against the savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions which had to be responsible for the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Life Dem Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for an independence now only to then force a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Pubertät: grow faster
Afro-American and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age associates, as studies show.
Body changes do not mean the puberty yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic fattening is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less prominent in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight breasts and shamhaar?
At the annual conference of the childcare association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time to calm up parents – usually this is not a sign of the rapid entry of the puberty," explained Kaplowitz.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair and body smell, appears in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarch (incidence of first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, something less than 12.75 in 1970.
“If the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Frühe Pubertät in Girls: the essential counselor for dealing with this frequent problem”.
Time is the most accurate test as the puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it applies to “frequency” when the breast enlargement is accompanyed by a growth dish before eight years of age.
In most cases, the process is slowing down or staggering – something that a child doctor can carefully monitor.
In the case of faster advances, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defence of another result: the premature ageing of the bones that can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicine or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is retaining on medicines, but he admits: “The oppression of the puberty can milden behavioural problems and the feelings of girls, different from being their agemates.”
The other major problem is understandable: Parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter got ten of her days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came terrified and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no preliminary evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causes.
Kids come into the puberty like girls before.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fattening.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, creating a link between body fat and the entry into the puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, afro-American and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age associates.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, a early puberty seems to be influenced from all possible things, from economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although kids grow the face and shame hair before, the trend to a full-definite earlier puberty is not as high as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shamhaar is spread even in babies and grandchildren.
“We must be careful as we identify the true beginning of the Pubertät," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their child physician how to talk to their child.
“That can mean that you must have a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blow early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even when it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers are fighting in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class in long-speed flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter impact on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most endeavoring airlines, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus demanded this week a industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US-American erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft builders are expecting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine longitudinal planes and at the event of the 17-21 November record contracts.
As the rear part of the plane is designed – in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is decisive for the specified economic results to provide the new mini Jumbo design.
Boeing claims that his modernized “777X” is 406 people in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane agents often distribute their technical details through advertising in the specialized press.
Now Airbus appeals to the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders is expected to race directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people are sitting together in a restaurant and the title “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-term flights in seats closer to regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus-Salective John Leahy.
In view of changing diet habits, people get thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, thus the data of the US Health Ministry.
The number of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to American health statistics.
Airbus says that his rivale is holding a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body volume of the freshly baptized "Jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies showed that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contradicts the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not appropriate to determine how airlines make the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It is really about to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they have to think to be successful," explains the airline expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is more eelbow free, but for manufacturers it will become increasingly an issue that can affect the turnover.
At the end of the discussion, a race for flight orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable effect on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the confrontation about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claims 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor longitudinal designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-site Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results depend partly on comparing the 777X with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in costs per unit is still lower than in current machinery with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore quests more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be related to cheaper flight tariffs.
“Eightteen inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from a economic point out, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabining, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer not seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world traveling Jet sellers even carry band size to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they prize the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-value design for cheap flight lines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-site rows, but has no one sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other producer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed, but could deduct from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garause
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could corrupt the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mouse from nicotine injury for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further attempts are needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have to experience that their nicotine insufficiency is more than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a continuous current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotin molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, thus a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials vaccinated mice, which was administered with nicotin, maintained their normal activity level.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "outtime", the researchers explained that the nicotin had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractic.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given to children if he was sure to be given before they were tempted to try a cigarette, and thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely is that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they are no longer enjoyable because of the Nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to take off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was still necessary.
Tripodi struggled to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former ministers of the Labour Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervision.
The former NSW minister argues that the rules for maritime plundering on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid had changed the hidden participation in three grounds on stately controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations on whether Obeid had influenced various ministers in this respect, Pacht contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without procurement after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi has known of Obeid's hidden interest in the lands after Tripodis' former vice-president, Lynne Ashpole, had pronounced accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed public procurement for the Pacht Treaties.
The stakeholders were opposed and wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the cargo contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which received $2.5 million each year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public procurement.
However, he fails to have made the changes on requests from Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged the reform of the government's pacht schemes.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a manager who had been switched to the port department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Is the subject discussed in this telephone discussion the development of commercial settlement arrangements?" asked the vice-president of the Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli battle planes attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting planes would have attacked a target in the Syrian Harbour Latakia, confirmed a leadership officer against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was the goal of Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air hits on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign employees with 457-visa could be subject to ‘security tests’
The government considers, in the framework of advanced measures, a ‘security test’ for foreign workers with 457 visums.
If the test is introduced, it would be used over a criterion to prevent the 457 being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the occupation of families and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal from the government was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be condemned by Australia's neighbours as a contempt.
“Suppressive statements such as “establishing foreigners behind” and “Australian first set” are a very unpleasant fall in times in which trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embarrass an echo of this historical artefact, I would not wonder.
The debate proposal declines twelve measures, once taken by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who lived yesterday in discussions about human smuggles in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the ‘security criterion’ is accepted, any person applying for a visa may be verified as to whether ‘the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company’.
In addition, companies could be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers, finally set up hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-long asylum died probably on a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The deceased nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for from the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring closer together Britain”.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very happy to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed street between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has assigned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capabilities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “The present announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on to use himself “inevitably” for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection offers the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic force of Scotland also provides an argument for rapid rail connections throughout the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, the benefits for all and complement the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government already plans.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the United States to lock the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, view or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, if they are in "fly mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it angry that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the US-American airlines to do a lot of work, however, does not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The Air Safety Authority also declared that the announcement would be viewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia remain.
“The CASA currently has no specific rules for the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft”, it has been accepted.
The subject is subject to provisions which provide that airlines must maintain security at any time and passengers comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin staff.
Virgin has already led to flights with the CASA discussions on the extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system and declared that it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after offering (draftless entertainment) during the flight," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that you will remain in the current regulations.
“Our current directives provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different from the age of the fleet in US companies.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand bags and customer instruction.
“When an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use more portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases in a bad view, the crew will advise the passengers to turn off the devices while landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment should be safely consumed under the seat or in the feet over the seats at start and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, co-operated BVB trailers with light rakets had been provided for horrible scenes in Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football bondage against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost acoustic acoustic that offered to the viewer just before the arrival of the Federal League game between the German Vice Champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park signal.
Hearing was mostly the guest fans with their singings.
On the other hand, the South Tribune, where the most faithful - and most loud - BVB-Fans stand, presented itself exceptionally quietly: no singers, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And on the front of the Tribune, a large flag lonely wounded with the title "Section Stadion Prohibition".
Only when Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as first BVB player enters the place, short-term joy burned.
When his companions followed, there was a loud song and a painful shell - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Triboune, nothing was right.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory about arsenal, contractual extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a celebration.
Only five minutes before the pitch climbed the Capo his podest - and the traceable excitement with hands just to that end disappeared in a loud cry, when the thickness as usual asked the mood on the rounds of the stadium.
Lastly, as always the South Tribune was on the row - and finally again here as used as the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with a pepper from the South Tribune the loud call "Derby winner stands up" was everything again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the last days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the cooperative BVB adhesives had fired lamps into the viewer lines and to the place - and hit nearly Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game has been pitched for the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzke's words, this was a rather unmarried date for the fan representatives.
"It will give massive cuts for the entire Ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday night on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
Non-tolerance policy in matters of pyrotech can't give up.
In addition, the Ultras has been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"That's going to be cutting," insured Watzke.
You may be excited as the responses to the south tribe are then.
Pfand houses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga has a golden armpiece, a ring and a pair of ear rings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, there is all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although they earn 3,000 Singapur dollars each month (approximately EUR 1,730) as an administrative employee and also work on her husband, the monthly family income is not rich, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of households is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, was the third pand house that is listed on the singapur exchange this week.
The proclamation of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapur dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Pfand houses in Singapore usually require an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just more than 15.4 percent demanding the United Overseas Bank, a local credit provider with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pfand houses, however, offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of the creditworthiness or income evidence here, so loans are faster than possible in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pfand houses after families feel the pressure through increasing life-keeping costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a slower financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income are looking for poundhouses in order to compensate for the difference in supporting economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through increasing hypotheses, referred to as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list by 80% of GDP, an increase of 60% still in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has almost come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing weakness of exports and left consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to complement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malaysian Bank.
Historical ceilings at the gold prices in the last two years have still strengthened the trend in the supply of personal items, as people use the opportunity to transform the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the plagued items are in the 200 pfand houses of the city state of gold.
People say: “The gold price looks good, let's pour our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month.”
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in its branches in the past months.
The growth in the pand business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, manager of ValueMax.
The company finances that by 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which this week took it with the exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors were charged for high interest rates in the crossfire, Yes explains that pfand houses are not only finer interest rates than other borrowers but also directly raised the debts.
“Customs pay goods that they already own, and the liquidation of personal value items does not increase the budget protection," she explains.
The Pfand Loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term and secure funding.
Not all people who use pfand lease are also in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to bring gold bars and Rolex watchs, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
“These include prosperous people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small enterprises that have to overcome the cash flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
NSA cleans data from Google and Yahoo from - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a principal interest in helping Germany in the information of the ever-breaking NSA peasuries.

Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic Health
The Australian Government consists of the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health system in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "inconsistent measures" to address a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government advice with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut a package of emergency rescue which we believe concerns the unique challenges that the state faces," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes $31 million instant aid for elections.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey stars, residues are to be removed.
In addition, there are money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better care for postal stays, medical training, psychiatric health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been affected by hospital workers that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister was on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission is established and aims to ensure that the state provides health services as efficient and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie today explained, the 325 million dollars would only benefit if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
In any case, he commended the government that she had responded to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal assistance will contribute greatly to taking the public health system of the state from the concern list," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compete the recent cuts.
But the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a 'paste solution'.
"We are therefore in today's position because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government takes almost a half billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth in 300 million and then acts like the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and guitar gas munition, explained the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while there were serious collisions in the north of the country near one of the locations where mutatisfactory toxic substances are stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, an Syrian Activist group announced that more than 120.000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war soon three years ago.
The announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, which the Damaskus organization established in the Hague had set to destroy all plants for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make “unperable” including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule targeting the destruction of all Syria chemical weapons until mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has to start destroying existing weapons and stocks.
It is assumed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senf gas and the nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when Thursday battle took place in the city of Saffira, of the experts said there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights notified in Great Britain.
The Activist Group, who pursues the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, explained on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
These include 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the sides of the government 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbolah Miles.
Likewise among the dead, 2 202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100.000.
This number has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides, but did not mention any details.
The fights underline the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to liberate Syria from his poisonous arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a magnificent civil war.
According to the OPCW, who cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team “is only convinced that it has seen all important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned in Syria and has experienced their destruction.”
Therefore, “there are currently no further inspection activities planned.”
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 out of 23 of Damaskus’ locations.
Because of safety concern, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC explained that the two locations were, according to Syrian statement, “was dismissed... and the existing objects of the chemical weapon program were transferred to other listed facilities that were inspected.”
It was not clear immediately whether the location in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I draw the hat before the deafness and courage you all showed when performing the most challenging mission that has ever been carried out by this organisation,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
In the meantime, the most synthetic Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and their security forces, which belong to many of the Alawits, a division of the Sicit Islam.
With regard to further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the Observatory, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of explosion was not known, he explained.
Wrong judgment for Bombenlegers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had killed in Bali in 2002 reacted angry about the judgment for the last of the instructors who were sentenced before the court, since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot standby.
Patek, who was nearly ten years of escape as one of the most sought people in Southeast Asia, was condemned yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack to a 20-year penalty.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt proverb also took place in a number of terrorist-related accusations, which included a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia of Holybend in 2000.
The lawyer had demanded a lifelong penalty, even though it could have applied death penalty for the man, who, because of his reputation, is called a master bomber, also called "Demolition Man".
The decision raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastatation that Patek and his companions had cultivated almost ten years ago.
With tears, she said that Patek should have been condemned to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put it before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with that I won't get any other grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made like the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a bomb exploded in a small loader parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer exploded an explosive-filled backpack.
After the attack, he fell into the coma for a month and “daught” three times, while he was hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Actually, this guy should have the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who was in court.
He was arrested nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011 in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent stated that secret service reports would have given an indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between South-Doctasiatic Terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't set himself," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown repentance for how much suffering he has caused to others.
The judgment took place before the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is held with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“It will give many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can contradict his judgment or appeal.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct mobile calls)
From departure to landing, flight travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and view movies, but not phone with the phone, so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employees Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The air carriers must demonstrate that aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of the air carrier and the arrangements for dispatching the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA declared that it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could soon authorise the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in an authorization.
At present, passengers must disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may start them again only when the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When the flight arrives, the passengers must turn them off again and do not start again before the plane is landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport planes and other planes that have been converted for use of Wi-Fi to larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight companions, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel like guardians in this topic.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for browsing, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres continued to be prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into the flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends” the Scrabble similar online game that the actress Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave publicly a jet of American Airlines because he refused to shut off the device while the plane was parked at the flight.
And more difficult devices like laptops must continue to be consumed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said of the National Transportation Safety Board, National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered as risks.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disturb transmitters," says Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, called by the FAA for the examination of this topic, recommended last month that the government permit a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to eliminate restrictions for use.
Critics like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid safety reasons for the prohibition.
The restrictions should also be more and more severe because the use of the equipment has become all-time.
In some studies, the speech of which up to a third of the passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices had become known by passengers with UKW radios, which then represented the latest technique trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not interfere with electronics.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic equipment generates significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-reader only generates minimal radiation when you refill.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amasone.com is one of the prosecutors of locking the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of childle E-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as regards the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the Passenger Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disturbance through the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports from pilots speaking for a disturbance of aircraft systems through the equipment, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices by passengers in the case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as reasonable adaptation for travellers that were now extensively equipped with technology.
“We are glad that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in opposition to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Aviation rescued by air rescue service of North Sea Bore Island
A bird flying to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea Bor Island, was released to nature again.
The water rod was fled last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was popped up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in its Rescue Center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the Centre, said: “This water ray was probably a winter bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for a refuge on the drill island.
He added: “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
During their release, the water rod was back fit and healthy.
Is Europe's Elite ready to deal with Britain's businesses?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing and defining the economy to a table, which would like to change our relations with the EU to those who in Britain provide prosperity and work.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1,000 leaders from the economy, representing in the UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that most of the companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU countries are stangling.
You wish to favour new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil from the government side instead of stopping with the long and efforting process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
As asked for certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to product law – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction on the internal market, as, according to the company's statement, the costs of Brussels' regulations would be more than the advantages of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40% of large companies agreed to the most traditionally Europe-friendly.
Finally, and that is most likely, our question of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wishes a course towards the change of the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "sensitive change", which brings the rehears of action back to Great Britain.
This is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion to the benefit of EU survival in a national vote at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: This survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear movement of powers back to Britain from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fisheries union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows what is a stronger focus for businesses on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas tar
The construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
“The present event is a milestone: the construction work at the Bulgarian section of the South Straam Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom and its Pendant in Ukraine, where the majority of Russian gases are stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard by the official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were disabled forever.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favoured tariffs when the entire project is operating in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work in other subordinated countries will begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is based on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged for sexual offences in connection with children before 2011 claims against the child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had said that “the organisation never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse".
Manager Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged for children's pornografie, and another one in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall had been condemned for his misuse in 1991.
Hare said to Gail Furness, an assistant of the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been inappropriate in the claim that “the YMCA had been subject to external audits, in which the YMCA was recognised as the first front in the field of child safety".
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that he received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Education Ministry) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed from me downwards in the position of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report infringements against the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced for the YMCA during his two-year activity for sexual infringements at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, she was privately serving as a baby-sitter, leaving her sitting on his shot, saying to one that he loved it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose commander was Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the children's servant Jacqui Barnat, who was the director of Lords in YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very inappropriate.”
The manager declared that he would not accept the statements of employees that they would not have trusted to report their supervisors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord has impaired their judgment, why they wouldn't have reported him.
Hare explained that he informed the Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn from the "Jonathan Lord Circle" was "not to report" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secret obligations was taken by the manager of the children’s services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what was “overreachable” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was in the time when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011, not a safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse, explained the Commission.
He explained that there have been serious problems in setting up, reviewing, inclusion, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was discontinued until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance of return as a British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening at the fifth anniversary of his excursion from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing itself to British politics, and its comments are usually limited to foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the quarter of the peacemakers in the Middle East.
To the question whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's Office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ...”
When the horse watch experts found themselves in sharpness in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition struggle took place.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not once in the children's garden and did his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee hit more locked through the three rounds and picked up the first price – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The unseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised because of their appearance, behavior and style for every year's competition, organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plater mosquito in a freaking angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which is far above his age.
And Toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practised every day with Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great tension.”
They had to enter against the entire participant field and have left the place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Perfect strangers in the Arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.

Howells said: “The whole audience was like electricized and everyone fired and clasped it.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and even though he looked so small, he did a fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmers and has two chickens he cares for.
As he started, it will not last long until he is on the “Pferd of the Year” shew – and I am sure he will cut well.
A speaker of the annual horse view said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they were hit and presented in the pre-direction ring.
They care for good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes have contributed to their part, that really fits perfectly for the reason.
Chinese newspaper is to be converted after calling "reformed"
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been charged for differentiation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted coupling money to fake reports about a partial company.
The new expression is now undergoing a “final rectification”, the regulatory authority explained.
The “Rectification Order” was carried out by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the stock exchangenoted company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was irregular," announced the regulatory authority in a statement.
She said that one decided to "do a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been advised to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant officers at the New Express and to immediately check the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported claimed financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the CCTV public broadcaster.
I did it first, because I was on money and praise.
I realized I did wrong.
Following Chen's excuse, the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it was failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have in recent times sent to the television.
Experts say that confessions are still being forced routinely, despite a legislative change in the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which were fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 inches tunnel as one of the most faulty passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are numerous unlikely storage halls, which makes it easier to hide with drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognised, the authorities explained.
In the detection of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, according to the records of the Court.
Three men who, according to the authorities’ statement, worked as drivers were charged for the ownership and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened in a debt prosecution of prisons between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set on an extended underground network of dehydration channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel the challenge of how to bring their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, governments found a 640 metres long passage with rails, which went from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still loves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr wants to go separate ways in the future.
But in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
The actress Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to separate his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was supposed to be radiated on Friday (local time), Bloom said: "The life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope it."
Kerr and he loved himself still, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their sonfriend Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarism, but it is quite different from this in a considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sandy places, ice or a strong edamer, these slems are not on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the veganer leaves from all food animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you may ask, but in closer consideration, the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable entrance.
"Brots are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the present reform house, who has a variety of special products available for veganers.
Reuben Proctor is also pleased to visit the store in the Domgase.
For 13 years, the negotiated New Zealand countries have lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (fast) everything he needs for life. "1997 I transformed my diet and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, then the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of nutrition, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the art leather attracts normal leather.
He realized that it also goes into other everyday interests without animal products.
Firstly, vegan is a ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," proctor says the maxime of the veganians, which extend to all consumption behavior.
Instead of marrying citizens, beasts, or rubber bears, the veganer quickly discovered entirely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not a failure, no axes, but it is an enrichment." The assume that with the nutrition transformation, the choice of food options is reduced, proctor is rather the power of the custom.
And precisely these conditions also failed some so well-measured attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," proctor makes a comparison.
And turns in: "Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste.
"You can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the veganians.
For example, proctor brings Aubergins, Champignons and a few Vegan Wursts to a grill festival.
He cares for a balanced, varied diet, with which it is also supposed to taste deeply.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increase in vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes that only feed vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I'm often checking," tells Proctor.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"When animals are nutrited with feed instead of grasing on the weed, it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 share is high," proctor finds.
For veganians there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Broad ways do not have to go proctor for food purchase.
Finally, there are basic nutrients everywhere and every supermarket has now soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find the place.
Just sometimes I'm buying something special.
"Many people are overlooking that only the finished products are expensive, but so is known in "usual" finished products."
Without prejudice, the preparation of vegan courts is far more favourable and less time-limited than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knees you can well if not partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more back powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cheese, Proctor could also bring his sweating parents to a surprise.
Family festivals give the veganer a new glove.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already faced with Skepsis.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Would I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a veganer with a fingerpit feeling.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," proctor does not want to declare an enklavendasein.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as vegan outstanding as suspected - and the veganer is not as limited in everyday life as usual.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dangers offer Falafels, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he wept on pasta courts, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of custom.
The restaurants are so slow to do it.
"When I started feeding myself veganly 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find a development: "You must talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to complement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the combs in Mannheim or the café free bird.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants at least have a vegan court on the food map.
Basically, vegane courts are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Flesh courts, however, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they quit others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the front impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchase of vegan products can be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when you learn to understand which can contain animal additives in earthnuts as colors, you seem to leave the courage with the following of ethics in so many obstacles and falling.
Not only because of this, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are added to food, but also cleaning.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to pride," white proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger show that struck on consciousness.
He may not be able to make sure that his habits are deployed, but at least he can teach the consumer to criticize his habits.
The carriage operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pounds in the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour because of data transport errors.
In August this year there had been two pounds in one week alone.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively defective purchase orders to the options markets for technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and stretch the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole share trade in the United States came for several hours because of a computer pane on the Nasdaq exchange.
In addition, for survival, the last year of Facebook's exchange.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchases and sales contracts, later fixed the SEC's Börsen Supervisor and defended the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler travels 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, at 22 o'clock, with a lady bike incorrectly on the left road from the station to the market location.
As a 63-year-old man suddenly walked from a local to the walk, the bicycle driver could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
On the next collapse, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went further to the ground and pulled up about 15 cm long seat wounds on the head.
A rescue wagon team brought the injured to the medical treatment.
British Police is giving Assange a delivery certificate
Today, the British police have sent a statement of delivery to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought a refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian has been given a “requirement to put himself” which calls for him to appear in a police guard, and added that he should not comply with it, threatening the arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the accusation in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to the delivery of the month at the beginning.
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, he had been looking for a refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th, and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “a 40-year-old man called on to put himself at a time chosen by us at a police guard," explained one speaker.
He continues to injure the conditions of his release to deposit.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he was delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spionage suggestions after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks Discovery Website.
Driving with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs receives 1,000 £ punishment
A driver was charged with a punishment of 1,000 pounds because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie knew himself guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also condemned for the payment of costs of 90 pounds and a sacrifice grant of 100 pounds.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation blase
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but it is still waiting for the final decision by taxpayer George Osborne, who had charged a stamp tax of 7 % in 2012 on apartments costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, in 2012/13, the revenues from the stock tax for residential property in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, collected sales for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the region Humber.
Cook said: “After the increase in steam taxes on high prices and the introduction of the associated legislation against a surgery, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low, regardless of the effects of the old community tax system.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors more retaining as regards the purchase of property in London, or stop selling owners," he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the rich London southwest belt, which ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, has devastated by the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by a emerging ‘inland market’, where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, such as Savills.
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context in which a dog with his mood stands.
Earlier research had shown that happi dogs with the wheat were moving more to the right (at the view of the dog), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can observe and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In human beings, the left and right brain half responds differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs the right half of the brain is responsible and reversed for the movement of the left side, just as in humans, and that the two hemisphere played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs reacted to the side of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the pie moves into the one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and thus we could control the movement of the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw how an else outprinted dog moved the pocket to the right (from the perspective of the wrecking dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tightness was mainly to the left (even from the perspective of the dog who weds), then their heart rate rose, and they looked distressed.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wearing with the pants in one direction is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest adolescent at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study that was investigated whether left and right for dogs was important.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Hounds are rather approaching a robot dog when their “switch” turns to the left and not to the right rather than to become unhappy – exactly different from the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details need to be determined – and dogs do not form an exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it is probably not going to take long until we understand, why the pit sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

Pope Franziskus appointed first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus will first call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Kardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Franziskus will designate the first group of men who will eventually participate in the choice of his follower.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached an 80-year-old can no longer participate in the pope election – this is falling within a group of 120 ‘electrified cardinals’.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Pater Federico Lombardi, a Vatican speaker, said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held for the appointment of new cardinals, which are also known as a consistorium.
“Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to call the consistory in advance in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals will probably be decreased until February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elected cardinals will be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistorium next year is therefore important because it has been the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, so Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will designate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the creation of the Kardinals Council founded by Franziskus, a group of eight Kardinals from all over the world, who have the task to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Franziskus asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far, we weren't in this situation – that's all very new.
Valero said that typically the Bishops from large places would be called to cardinals, but put Franziskus “full of surprises – so we don't know who he designates.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat loan
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks with the 2014 construction year in order to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat lounge, thus a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for rewinding the front seat loan.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in head support.
“If the back of the vehicle is going up, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury”, was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models called were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the main model start of the leading US auto manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative impact on the sale of cars in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 silverado- and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 per cent at the New York Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
A Obama valuator's despair shout
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change would be possible
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been destroyed by the blockadectic of the Republicans
The blockade policy does not excuse the site problems of Obamacare, the Drohnen attacks
Obama's Memorial of the 2008 election struggle was a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at the Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It's a book that I believed it would clean up me during the stupid second year of my medical study and give me hope.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” (Mut to win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient prints at evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when the politics inspired millions and a speech robbed the breath.
The choice became a victory and newsspeakers kept in mind in order to lead to the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At the time of 2008, Obama switched to office, he had consent values of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were screwed out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vain reminder, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has accomplished from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Medical Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced diversity of homosexuality in the army and the murder of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partial policy blockadectact has ceased too many efforts that our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to mention only a few.
But after I defended the Obama Government numerous times against colleagues and familiars, I ended with my explanation requests.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The republikan blockade policy cannot explain why the hearing of foreign heads is allowed or the killing of innocent children through drones in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' privacy and why Whistleblower is punished, revealing state misbehavior.
It cannot explain why al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures, nor why the public financing and issue limits are overcome during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it states that the efforts of the White House to rest the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon Government.
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether when I was 18 years old, I should have understood that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MEP is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacher are the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be mostly elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidature.
My Romney represented a confusing and unexposed alternative, he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of so long.
However, with the decline of acceptance values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book.
It raises in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-selections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral helpers after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionary and Member Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott stands in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters may become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of 6 million dollars to CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, for when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer electoral Commission officially declared with 53 votes ahead after the re-telling to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process for voting so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have no system where you march in, which inputs data into a computer, immediately choose and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of blisters when marking the voting list.
Do you use it because then you can wipe out the results if they don't like you?
It is incredible to vote with pencils today.
The electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy belongs to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very serious”.
At a public office it is about the public service.
"We are pursuing no reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two devisor dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its devising department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indicative that the global administrative investigation of the discretional manipulations in the currency market is rapidly travelling.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world’s largest financial market surveys, which switch to the owner of the U.S. dollars every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation, which the Scandal attracts around the Libor interbanking business.
The bank, who did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation stated that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been admitted to his current position as a European leader of the Forex Spot trader at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was advertised this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these dealers was deceived of any mistake.
Bankers belonged to the Usher Instant Message Group at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation of nearby people.
UBS announced this week that she took steps against some of her employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority Finma had explained that she was investigating a discreet manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with claims that bankers should have spoken on monetary market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said to people familiar with the situation.
Banks get through Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of cases of failure.
The news about these investigations has placed the dealers in an area of upstanding which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies reduces the opportunities for speculates.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affairs and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-grade liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of devising trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms through banks leads to the fact that “the market can be influenced with very low ticket prices".
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she announced a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars in the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is inhaled," explained Credit Suisse.
Painted the Building Sea on the Bechtle Ground
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has praised the construction saune on the Bechtle foundation at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, says in a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain threatens to cut off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had abandoned the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI was a transparent message "We have been applied for it".
However, this disturbed about 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the big poster called "We are against building ruins".
This would point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss wheat - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building" it was clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will make many better, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to delay these answers, it says from sides of the BI.
As it was heard, the public statements of the Mayor also have effect.
In May, at the Municipal Council meeting, he had said that he feared the out of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss grass.
Some seem to be just scared, others feel it as a "plump depressive attempt" to the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte für Schiris: Mane no swallow King
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current high-form of the Federal League Table Leader Red Bull Salzburg is also, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" by the guardians.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pressed into the category of sulphur kings," he protected the two open-hand whispers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig on the last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a claimable actress of decay - which was not quite as the TV pictures showed.
"A crush misdecision", said Rangnick, who referred to as "overreacher Harkam".
In addition, Harkam would have contributed his "one part" to eskalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hüter after the party.
He decided his German countryman, "I would have behaved in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the sharp mouer.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
However, in view of the success cycle, Rangnick agreed to a praise shymne.
"There are only two words for this: Right good," he stated.
There is not much delay.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's just gonna go on so quiet.
Border changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to a player, he wants to leave the club," Ranknick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the government Obama: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to conclude a health insurance or to pay a punishment until 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State’s tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the general law and also held that the standard of the health law that states would need to extend either the conditions of access to Medicaid or otherwise, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The prosecution against the law had been stressed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading republikan presidential candidates, including the final Chairman Mitt Romney, in the 2012 preparing campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes with giant mirrors light
With gigantic mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian place have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunrise, the Rjukan, located in the Westfjord valley, is usually declined from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 metres height, a century space was true on Wednesday.
"At the end!", burial champion Steinar Bergland swarmed at the start ceremony in the TV2 broadcaster.
Some valley dwellers set up sun chairs, others set up security half sunglasses.
So far, in the winter, sunny hungers had to drive with a seilway to a near top.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the radiation into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has been in the place since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner (approximately EUR 615 000) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpenort Viganella winter sunlight for a few years.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday leather are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying of sun and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP notifies.
A request from the FDP has confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post building in the Ernst-Ludwig Strasse 36 and in the Jakob Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld will be deleted.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten, Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request.
The social and youth policy speaker of the FDP, Fritz Rörenbeck, wants to come here.
The Sunday lecture is an important post service just at the date post.
"This is radical and inappropriate to this business despite the increase in prices for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, President-in-Office of the Liberals, supports his colleagues: "What irritates me is the fact that here is crushingly changing or being deleted the employees."
The post is miles away from the neighborhood.
"The mailboxes in the districts of Newslot and Rosengarten must at least be emptied on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens, a mailbox with Sunday lecture should have to be able to reach feetly.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration plans to talk to the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also gives a Sunday lecture in Hofheim.
Their party has spoken for privatization.
"Then decisions are made otherwise," said Maier.
Frankfurt's parking fees are to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive.
The magistrate of the city presents this morning a presentation of the transport desk Stefan Majer (Green).
Consequently, park fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.
For this, however, prices should not be increased, but the period of parking watchs and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the City Organization Assembly has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee believes that it is "not a good idea".
The parking potential directly before the business is "a non-predictable advantage for smaller traders".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonable and actually overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Congratulations: Quick Actions Overcome Guests
With a narrow frame, the Gentlemen I of the TSV had to join in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swib Alb.
Although the apples were with a experienced team on the other side.
Soon, however, it was shown that they, even older terms, could not fully compete with the fast actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placed revolts, the Gönninger were very difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean through the network centers and were not in place at the block warrant.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all interests.
In view of this depressing and play-determining performance, then the third sentence was somewhat lazy and unleashed to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to be clear in Nagold, there will be a significantly stronger opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Büerle, Yannik Büchele, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räler, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and the city of joy were faced.
They delivered a hard fighting two-hour battle.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and score gifts in the ballet; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes lackingware and in some critical play scenes the overseer prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this highly balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, voted through the great physical use and a joyful commitment of both teams.
Maintenance day at the small English cabin
To now the fifth day of care, following the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach.
As a result of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the cabin should be cut off into the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers described this area as the glossy of the climb, where the landscape offered the ideal framework for glorious views.
He thanked the attendants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nurse day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the relationship between human and natural.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Presidium Freiburg following the greeting by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen rule and wished the action a good success.
The tourist objective of the wide view covers, according to Tribukait, the goal of maintaining the strongly grown old almendwide field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing weeds.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass jumpers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free contacts to maintain species.
Tribukait said she would not want to fail to break a lans for the planned biosphere area at this point.
This plan does not add the current measure to its necessity.
A biosphere area also offered the opportunity to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the future of the life project and the previous care days.
According to these various statements, district leader Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been struck before, the forest slinger may be ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wactainer bushs and the care of a dry stone bulb.
The goal was the free view at the outlook point.
Loffs: Buffers still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baartchen Löfingen can be called an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own city work has not yet been reported by a second mayor.
As the only candidate for the result of the citizen Norbert Brugger who is no longer candidate for age, the 46-year-old bank purchaser and operator Dieter Köpfler from Löfingen has been established.
The duration of the application will expire on Monday, 11 November, at 18:00 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei charged for Nortel patents
The group, who owns thousands of former Nortel patents, striked on Thursday a lawyer of complaints for patent infringements against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was surrounded by Nortel insolvency.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patent had bought for 4,5 billion US dollars, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent injury before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google will be monitored in seven cases of patent injury.
The patents are technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, thus the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC create mobile phones working with Google’s operating system Android, which stands in sharp competition to the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave an initial offer of more than 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased his offer several times and offered the last 4,4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel patents were offered by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12,5 billion, a business that was also motivated part of Motorolas library to patents.
“Almost Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaints at the auction, Google has hurt the patents and continues to do this," says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high claim from Google, as it claims that Google's patent injury is deliberate, so the accusation.
Egypt defends the first freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi puts off the office, but his day of triumph is not supposed to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus entered the success of Husni Mubarak, who had been dispatched from the office 16 months earlier.
With his introductory office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth Head of State since the crash of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the court, which has his seat at the Nile and has been impressed by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the festival ceremony that was transferred live in the state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability”, said the 60-year-old Mursi, a engineer and member of the Muslim Brideship, a fundamentalist group, who has been taken sharply as a prohibited organization from the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. in a small autoconvoy.
Only a few hundred trailers had been gathered before the court to congratulate the new president, and in contrast to the presidential Prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was only suspended in a short time, so that the autoconvoi could cross the normally lived road that connects the city centre with the southern prestities.
As an uncharismatic 'replacement wheel' of the brotherhood, his personal presidy has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, with which he presented himself not only as a candidate of Islamists but all those who wanted to achieve the goals of resurrection from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypten is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," the Mursi dressed the judges in a blue dress with red crochet, explained in the chamber in which he put the office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Kairo, where he was supposed to hold his approach speech.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel that played the National Hymne, which he listened to in Habitat.
The military leader of Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the University with speakers of "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a University of Islamistic Students in the 1970s.
On Friday Mursi put a symbolic oath on the Tahir site, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rulership of Mubaraks, and he promised to call back presidential powers which had taken over the military council by the Head of State hunted from the Office.
However, with the departure of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the Parliament, he declines to the will of the military, which indicates that the battle of power will continue.
Mursis spoke on the Tahir site was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening it continues with a Ü 25 party.
Bold beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers, of course, on both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and hurts hardly.
The man from Lamp Right Houses wanted to exchange a defective heater at the outer stage of a guesthouse.
When he went to the ladder that was attached to the roof, this shot away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to the Salzburg National Hospital with the rescue heavily "Christophorus 6".
Violents in South Africa: twice lifelong prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and condemnation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the actor has been condemned twice lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty for the beginning of the week of crime.
The deed had triggered a country-wide disfellowshipping.
The 21-year-old Anene Booysen had raped in February in a industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but forgively.
The sight of young people was so disgusting that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in the real night with booys.
He also stood to have hit them and raped them, but he decided to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had first come out of several actors, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The lawyer also stressed during the procedure that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violations are almost everyday in South Africa: Annually there are about 64 000 ads for sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers of sexual violence to 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest shinken
Jumbo was looking for the "best shinking of the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker is evident at the beginning: The most important thing for the shinks is the pig cules, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can shinks that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as the chief of the large shinking factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Deutschland's dear shinks", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Shinking.
Only with hair guard and kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands first before he gets to the micro.
Visited Jumbo for strengthening at Quickimbiss in Forest Shut
"Here will work me roaring quantities," the TV makers, black forest shinks as a mass product are excited.
16.000 cups per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, color: Uli explains what it comes to with quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with level?
Details like the p-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited if you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television in cleaning is presented.
But it's worth watching.
The viewer sees that the depletion of the chickens continues to be handjob.
For: Black Forest Shinking is traditionally found without bones in the rim.
The secret of the shink is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoking storms and smoking fires Jumbo optically recalls a "U-Boot".
The Trick: Tunnel beads make the special taste of the black forest shinken in the smoke here.
Twenty days in the smoke make the shinks almost black.
"Now the disc is disappearing in the Jumbo," he announces the test-peeching.
"There's really nice," says the fazit of the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belonged to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from holidayrs in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travelling company now accounts for a cleaned annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means growth from 12 to 17 percent compared to record gain of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As Director Graham Turner announced, in the first half of the year, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are in good ways towards record year income before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our most powerful results.
In Australia, the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while the business customers also spend less.
The U.S. business was recovered compared to the seasonal condition weaker first half of the year, so that for the third year a profit is expected for the whole year.
The shares of the Flight Centre rose to $38.20 yesterday at 3 cents.
Schools are stopped to focus more on mathematics, writing and grammar
In courses to English literature, students must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic Lyrik and contemporary British Romans from 1914.
The examination also finds "invisible texts" in the way of encouraging more wide reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is dismissed.
From 2015 students need to make a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualifications.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first factors that have been radically transformed.
Other nuclear vessels will be modified next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Surveillance Authority for Examination, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new benchmarking system and less course work.
In one speech in the summer, Minister for Education, Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence” and he stressed that the GCSEs would be “come challenged, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools are an average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, it is said from coalition circles to encourage schools to use more hours, combined with greater weighting of the field in rank lists.
In the learning plan, more attention is given to ‘the problems of the right life’, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious towers attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and color strokes present the circle association performance view this weekend in the citizen house.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Economy Conversation Forum
The next Economy Summit on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, is the theme "To hell with hell - Theological considerations about today's dealing with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Economy Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communes of Salem, the castle of Salem and the Culture Office of the Soil Sea.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum of the question, how today people are graduating the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much of it and put on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which are our ideas up to now," the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is rather depicted by a certain disturbance or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been exposed to Christians by religious criticism," says the referent.
She gave us "so many question marks that the calling marks seem to have come away from us".
Johanna Rahner continues to say, "But the decisive challenge remains the angry of death."
This involves the question of that desire, "who dreams of that everything may be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she promovated to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and economical theology followed in 2003 at the Western False Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has incorporated a teaching chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geisling: More than 100 young Catholics from the Small Heuberg confirm their faith confession in the company
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths have been firmed at the Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning, the group Loudato-Si, the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit, was accompanyed.
When the company was received, the youths said yes to their baptism and offered the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner, the firms had prepared themselves for the great celebration of many municipal members.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Undermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountainbike race enthusiastic participants
On beautiful weather, 214 bicycle drivers came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This tells Ulrich Knobel from the Illmensee Sports Association.
Among the participants, in particular on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 metres, were also a number of hobby wheels who once wanted to exercise their hobby in the hobby.
Two junior drivers of the German peak class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German masterships.
These two were expected to stand off from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time spring to the goal and defend his title as a total victory of the short distance.
At two places, Pascal could relocate himself faithfully.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team of nightmare that created it at the top of the victory trail.
At place two and three, Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie came from Owingen drivers.
A joyful development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole bandwidth was represented by athletes.
The age structure also reached from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years in the oldest launchers.
In the main race this year more absolute topathlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional peak drivers.
Thereunder Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike helbprofi from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already two times world champion in 12-hour features.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With this also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of height, there was a revoltfinal in the target in the front of the three-sea-hole.
Pangerl was first rushed over the target line.
Only a second behind it, the Routinian Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the total rating.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the total assessment.
Christiane Cohsmann was the time fastest in the main race.
The second place secured Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sports and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through sludge, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance in distant villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of “CNN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw how his sick father repeatedly lost the consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 at a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then a inflammation that expanded on his brain and there caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overfilled hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not visit.
Two of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered, in Bwelle, the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation named ASCOVIME, travelling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and riding with the cured medical equipment on the roof over unfested terrain in the villages that need help.
Everything's not always running smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and muds.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a festival, song and dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling – with its broad smiles and its borderless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team begins with the study of hundreds of patients.
“We are going to treat 500 people,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 kilometers around the village – and this to the foot.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, undernaught, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crows, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families are simply unable to provide.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local destruction.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, the council or a apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the group's generator and thus works Bwelle and its volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night, so that we can keep on awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free surgery in the last year and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for people who help them.
One man explained that the free operation of a performance break that he received now enabled him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend hospital and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private hospitals in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his commercial activity, so Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who in the second year studys the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and voluntaryly cooperates in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to spend money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nurse students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gather practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be with surgery where we help to drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often spent sanitary material.
But if they are only in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people does not know any limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to enjoy a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given his Father, brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to linder the pain.

Excellence of the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body.
Janson is even an old hatred in his meteoric, the acting art.
No one can pretend the old man Santiago when fishing.
That's how the two simply complements great.
It is almost meant to be able to see the folds in the neck of the old man, which the fisherman's young man Manolo speaks about.
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair, that's true with Janson.
The role of the old fisherman is also through and through a character role that Janson excells.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his willingness.
Janson is on the stage in a wide range of ways as an individual.
He is able to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so his monology is not a moment boring.
His efforts to move the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lighted water bottles.
Regisseur Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat before the Fisherdorf.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: the house of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings the life of Kubas with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythmus for it and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Decline to the Romans
At approximately 120 metres length, a wastewater channel from the Roman time is received below the cologne.
Whoever visits Cologne, does not pass the dome.
About 157 meters, the two towers run into heaven and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only few visitors who admire the two filigranean church towers, believe that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is expert in Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for his leaders is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the dome.
The round begins quite unspectacular: "We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the seventy years, the city fathers wanted an auto-right city, and therefore the rest of the old city walls only remained that which was not too large.
So most users of the parking house are going to pass by the Roman remains today and only put their car off.
But whoever looks closer, in the park cover D2 discovers an archaeological founding site separated by metal grids.
It can be seen about five meters of ruins of handtellers of stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before returning to daylight, schoolze lets participants at the upper parking level throw another look into a dark, 15 meters deep box.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly observed.
The next station of the round is the pretorium, and here the participants go down to the depth.
We experience here the office of the one most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA's presidency.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "Stadt of Roman law and city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar of Emperor Culture".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which is given here at about 120 metres length.
"You can go quietly along a piece of the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze rejoices the guests.
A surprise still has schoolze.
After picking the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, comfortable box.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bathroom deep into the ground to come to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
Until now, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins fall to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the cottage for which the construction work is to be started shortly.
However, until completion, a few years will go.
Benes almost hacked off: Relay of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be rerolled after more than four years.
A process of attempted death, dangerous injury and injury against two 30-year-olds has started before the court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The prosecutors lie down for the arrival.
They were supposed to have been active in the Rockers scene and then belonged to the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the state lawyer claims that they, together with unknown complications in Finowfurt, have put and hit three men in a car.
All the victims were severely hurt, a man would almost have lost his leg.
The victims should have heard of the competing grouping of Hell's Angels.
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems that a chase of persecution had passed before, with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was about revier fights and a power demonstration.
The two complainants had been released in an initial procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker then said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feather.
The actors had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Court of First Instance rejected the judgment after revision of the State Prosecutor and rejected it to the Court of Justice for the Reconciliation of the Court of Auditors.
One of the accused persons is currently under an open execution because of another debt.
The arrival was mainly about the reconstruction of the runners in the real night.
As a witness, the inquiry Commissioner was charged at that time.
In the centre, mobile conversations of the accused and other persons who had heard the police were found.
Hard is that Rocker is almost always adhering to a law for them - and not saying.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had extracted.
State lawyer Stefan Golfier of the German lawyer Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last procedure.
For the process, eleven further negotiations are set.
The arrival society doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it's going home.
Only: In the buildings of the people on the bike and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What is closer than chilled to drive into the next drive to get a small thing?
I admit, I like to join you when it goes to fast-food holes at late night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a citizen - and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco engagements are noticeable.
For what must one miss that with steady regularity, one throws his fast-food guns out of the car window?!
Especially in the weekends, thrown papers are on road edges and parking lots.
"Why?" I ask.
Are people too deaf to take the bags with home and to the next trash?
It's not just that the paperboard disperses the landscape.
Carpets have also covered transport facilities such as guide planes and thus caused accidents.
But it wasn't thought about this, but she probably doesn't even know what this word really means.
When you're more frequent on your way at evening, only right with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look for fed nights: clothes, bottles and other waste towers there.
There would be a few bags more or less - in contrast to the road, where no one wants to tramp on the food rests of others.
I see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will have to be blurred - and the fast-food chains need to demand for their pounds.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
According to severe criticism, President Obama made a retractor of his often repeated, clear promise yesterday: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a cancellation letter, the Republicans sent the President to the last days, that he deceived the U.S. public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
"The majority of the citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to revise a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive such a better, comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than forecasted.
“They come a better offer," he said.
The government declared it a little surprising that the five percent of the people who have completed an insurance themselves would have to look at another tariff because their contract does not meet the new standards in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say these Americans directly: you have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
“I am as frustrated and angry as all others are,” she said.
I'm determined to get your trust back.
This statement of Sebelius, an advisor to her sitting behind her in the yesterday hearing at the Representative House, was recorded after a dispute with the republikan member Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamamare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly stressed the question why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a Stately supported insurance in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm an attack on Syrian Air Force Baseline
A U.S. government officer who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news broadcaster CNN that Israeli battle planes had attacked an air-weapon in Syrian Latakia one day before.
The goal was "raketes and related equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbolah, according to CNN.
The Syrian and Libanesian media, as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the foundation in the port town of Latakia was shot in the night from Wednesday on Thursday, and the Israelites were responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia, where Russian defence tractors of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rakets were seen, according to which channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport blowheads up to 70 kilograms.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel has executed the attack but is not sure.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We don't comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the day newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successful, to deliver ground-air raketes to the Hisbolah.
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that every attempt of Syria to provide hisbolah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the override of a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that the US spionage had “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry indicated, with an unexpected consent, a distortion of the United States' disgusting attitude in relation to their monitoring programmes by saying that in certain cases the spionage was “inappropriately far too far”.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, deceived the responsibility for being switched to “autopilot” when the explosive explosive explosions of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spionage activities of the NSA.
The U.S. government has been in a diplomatic storm of dismantling from its allies by means of information.
In a video-connected speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have run quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was what was going on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on September 11.”
Following that, as a first high-level member of the U.S. government, he acknowledged that the US spionage had exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: “In some cases this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to make clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, claimed that the NSA was a power of goodness and had been saved many lives by its monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to sprout themselves into the air.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is deceived to kill people, sprout into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of humans because we have experienced in front of such plans.
In the meantime, US-American lawyers will travel to Europe to distinguish the concerns against the claimed American spionage and to convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the United States in anti-terror efforts, as explained by the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organisations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our common efforts to combat terrorism," Murphy, who is the first to sit in the Senate as a Democrat and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for External Relations and European Affairs, explained in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of phone data in Europe have caused relations to some U.S. bonds, although the head of the Secret Service this week stated that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected and exchanged with the United States.
Other explorations quoted from Snowden documents that the NSA has monitored the phone of Federal Cancer Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spionage in allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the assembly to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participants are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve the relationships, he also said that there would be some 'earst words'.
He said that the European governments would have to be honest to their people about the kind of spy programs they have been using for years.
"Where we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also find out that we are not the only ones who spionate," Murphy says.
On the other hand, John Kerry is traveling to the Middle East and to Poland in the weekend to deal with the cruelty about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US-American surveillance activities.
A harsh injury at the jumping gel is threatening to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federalliga outdoor game of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz asks for a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have its best tower shooters with six hits.
Because the Mainzers must already leave the injured performances of Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartling and Niko Bungert.
Australian is a proclamation against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has condemned the judgment and was released on security.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of a Province Court in Phuket on 15 June, having made a false statement after giving it to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men arrested them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had come to her hotel safely after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interviewed Bamford for two days until she understood the story.
Until the judicial negotiation, she was on the ground in police.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a prison centre with a low level of safety at the edge of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course we are very concerned, but we hope that it will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has invoked against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime it takes vacation in the village of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the sides of the court was to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be endeavored to improve its attacked tourist image after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's travelling wife in Phuket, and it is therefore a free speech.
