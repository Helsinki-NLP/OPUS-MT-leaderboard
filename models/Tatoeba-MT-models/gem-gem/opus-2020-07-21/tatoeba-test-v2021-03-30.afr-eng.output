He's not just speaking French, he also speaks Spanish.
I don't think anybody found out what you did.
That's a nice couple of legs.
One, three and five are inequal numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooked.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It's just not worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.
No one's gonna care about it.
Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
This will be our secret.
This potato is white.
Sometimes he looks at TV.
Drink!
Do not miss the event.
It's a little cool.
He's better than me.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to view man as unique among other living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You work too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.
Tom wouldn't hurt to yoke.
"I never thought about it," the old man said. "What will we do?"
Forget about them.
Tom did not happen to kill.
Mary is Tom's wife.
Where are the other girls?
Newspaper reporters were not allowed inside.
I like cold pizza.
He wasn't wearing a jacket.
He condemned racial discrimination as an evil.
I drink water.
The food did not taste so bad.
She is two years older than you.
I never said so.
I'm not blaming you.
She married him.
If I was you, I started inevitably.
She has blonde hairs.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot clean from him.
The horse is in the forest.
Another coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
Okay, I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where's Tom eating breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You must have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the errors, if there is.
My conscience hurts me.
Many houses were swallowed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick thousand paper birds fold, her wish will be true.
Tom forgot clean from them.
Do not be late for the train.
If you find something with which you are good and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
I was sorry to hear about her.
Whatever you do, do not let the new phone fall.
Why don't you help me catch the hanging worms?
It's not a joke.
Tom is not going to make any deliveries today.
The eye is the soul’s mirror.
The boy who writes the best wins the price.
Tom won’t stay with us next weekend.
I work at this company.
Tom can't swim.
You drink water.
She loves him.
Tom didn't go.
Do you have a phone?
Do you know the boy who cries?
Tom will help you.
A guy doesn't need you.
Birds sing.
If the idiots were to compete, you would come second, because you were too tired to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don't want to remember.
Flits!
They are in the library.
Tom better did not.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we will end.
Tom was standing up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We're not going to eat everything.
But you know well that these negative consequences would have.
He will never believe me again.
Tom climbed his judge.
The two villages were separated by a river.
We decided not to dismiss them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know any of them?
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I'm not going to be fooled in it to do it.
All we can think is real, but what is real is the real question.
I am now staying in Norway.
Tom shouldn't die.
I won't be able to help you.
Nobody tells me what to do.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can You Write an English Letter?
My name is Tom.
This is a Memorial from Hokkaido.
I told you before, didn't I?
Don't throw the dog with a stone.
This man shouted to me!
Be more careful from now on.
Please go faster.
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will one day for the first time choose a woman as president, and there will be joy over the long expected opportunity.
Thank you, you just ruined my life!
We will switch you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I've never met.
My father's name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I'm in a scene.
Do not believe all that people tell you.
I don't speak good enough French!
I'm not going to come to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a damp, grey summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go in.
I'm going back to my office.
I'm not talking Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I overcome later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami repaired it last week.
What should we do around him?
The food is right.
I dress my socks in a japtrap.
Tom continued trying.
Tom won't dare.
My horse is black.
If it's false, she's a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to send this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do that?
Do you not add sugar?
I’m not easy to fear.
She's doing her homework now.
What shirt will you carry to school today?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The walls were a light brown paint.
You're afraid of him.

Maybe I shouldn't be so suspicious.
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
He's a man of faith.
Tom won't die.
I don't want to see you.
He Prejudges Jazz
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
Can I look at your ticket?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams are always different.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I'm sure I'm not going to be of much help.
The air is blue, the sea is also blue, and the air and the sea are blue.
Robert was so busy that he had to reject an invitation to play golf.
Tom's not going to wait here so long.
He's my brother.
All human beings are born free, with equal dignity and rights; they have reason and conscience, and should act with one another in the spirit of brotherhood.
They are worried about her.
The television costs more than the sunglasses.
You are the most beautiful girl in the world.
I've been used to it against now.
Can you make me a copy?
What's he doing here?
I finish my homework.
Is it so hot?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where is your baggage?
Who called these bodies to dance?
Can you turn off the lights?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She continued to work.
He's young.
Tom was then busy.
Who made this foolish house build?
He cannot speak much English.
I just wondered if you could find a place to stay yet.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom's not going to stand down.
Martha is an excellent pianist.
Let us keep at the point.
The news spread quickly.
Do you have a fireworks?
Chinese food has made the greatest impression in China.
Please hurry!
The dog jumped over the hill, into the garden.
Can I take a day of leave?
The warm bath relaxed my muscles.
Read this book.
Does he write letters in English?
We got a big garden.
Do not waste your money by buying things you don’t need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do that.
She had a house at the sea.
Have you ever been in Paris?
It's the last strip.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you!
She looked beautiful.
We all go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He's not just speaking French, he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is first in the list.
Is it necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She runs.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that cake?
He was a good king.
They said that they have always done so.
We are looking for each other.
I'm just looking.
Unfortunately, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I would not be surprised.
It's raining.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were still very young.
Tom would never have done so.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
It was his decision.
I didn't really want to win.
I'm no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom's shaking.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like traveling by a plane.
We really have nothing to lose.
Sami stays with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does it make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
His music is known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice, no matter what you say.
That's pretty normal.
I love your son.
Tom is not going to appear at all.
I must have suggested myself.
Let's exercise.
It was hard for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success .
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he did not kiss Mary.
The bell sounds.
I'm not going to get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they have always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.
I'm a friend of Robert.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard of him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember how I heard of her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
Yesterday this time was on to the bioscope.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let us wait until he comes.
Tom coloured his hair dark brown.
That's what you get!
Will Tom die?
A dog ran behind the cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.
Tom was imprisoned.
It's not a joke.
You promised you will come.
I would be crazy to expect such a thing.
Christmas father stays in the North Pole.
I was born in Tokyo and trained.
I got cold.
Let's sit down the television.
Unfortunately, I would not be very good company.
You will not be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
But I would go out with you.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like praise.
He's not always at home Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for a easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I'm not sleeping anywhere tonight.

Where did you learn it?
You're stupid.

She chose to give up under pressure from her parents.
I have to help my mother.
He stays in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and took a flashlight.
I think I may be out of a job.
I told Tom I'll be right now.
My son still believes in Christmas Father.
I hate driving.
Sami needs to wait a little.
Are They Friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter in that area alone.
Sami did not notice that.
Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks forward to the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She has been able to read.
He seems to know the secret.
Do you have a phone?
Mr Mitchel gave me that I paid the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I constantly dream of her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There is probably a easy solution for you.
I totally forgot about her.
We need to start doing so.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I had two cups of coffee.
I forgot clean from her.
Tom died that it was unfair.
I don't want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you rise, he will be studying.
I got a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The warriors lasted for a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to take a talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health, we learned by studying diseases.
Tom sits at the window reading a book.
We're not going to be here at 2:30.
I like eating meat.
I did, however, we could make it at 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the battlehouse.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so bad at all.
I eat rice.
Excuse me! May I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It's raining.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that revier.
I bought only a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The bet starts tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
It's my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my parabrel.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer getting help through Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, trust him.
You must have visited Kioto.
I rose up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God had not existed, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Let in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could enter the thickest clothes, especially on sea, a poor boat with only two men entered the sea.
Nights all cats are grey.
Silence!
It's my house now.
A bird flys.
He had 30 minutes to arrive.
He went out to a English-Japanese dictionary on the office.
Whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
I wish you said it before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking for.
Tom had a lot on his board.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the following!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot clean from her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities. Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Signals.
I'm glad you finally came back.
