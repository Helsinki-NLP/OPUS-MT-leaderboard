28-year-old kok in San Francisco Mall invented
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim said that he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "Everything went up with him again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, announced the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked earlier as a cook in Boston, had been a dream job six months ago as a cook in the Sons & Dachers Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Sons & Doughter said that they were shocked about his death and destroyed on the ground.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we're going to miss it painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and compassion are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia claimed that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things finally went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," told Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting his family was to always cook us something, to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who was swimming with the electricity.
"In all that was wrong in the world, he was this unslepen diamond, who shined bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case shall be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under paragraphs 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star clear in an interview now incredibly.
"I will always be put in drawers or get clamped up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself don't want to be perfect and successful."
"Perhaps, these things are rather smart to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that it is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The most loving actress spends her time at home, forming televisions with loud dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glory, they bring the question about the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is to see as a single mother of two sons.
The movie is running with us from August 25th.
Golfer Longer gets the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues searched for a little differentiation with a trip on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-olds.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home in the fast galopp.
One kilometre at this speed, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Longer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all the time - 101 tournaments - back near horses.
He was able to lead with his family through the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swing himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thereby also at the CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
The German sports aid gave the man from homes in the context of a small gala the Golden Sportpyramid.
The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already poured him.
Longer is the 18th priceholder of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first priceholder Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means me very much," says Langer, "for it is not only for sporty success but also for social engagement."
For decades longer has promoted growth.
And so he also gave the price money of 25,000 euros on the same.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the two-fold U.S. master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the excellent ones are the lightathlets Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Feders Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderful.
Many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday.
According to the official part, the illustrated society moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza price ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance to the large animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
Unfortunately, however, the two U.S. presidency candidates are in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warn about how the State of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.
It will take a massive reduction in regulations, and it will make it strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to fulfil, he has a disadvantaged opportunity to open and needs money for it.
That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in them.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical theaparty wings of the Republicans.
So on Trump, there could still be partial internal discussions.
Clearer are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and back up coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is intended to dismiss it.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and calls for: "A country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."
But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, both of the United States do not want to isolate from international trade - but just to protect American jobs better.
They should then be better paid, calls for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to increase to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rise, then he says he may not be changed.
However, the major discussion in the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to evacuate the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
His critics insist on him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution.
Flight: "Every flourished woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatic.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at least one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with great eyes.
His mother stars on the table.
Until she notices she's watched.
She smiles shortly and kisses the little one.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a sectoral business leader of Condrobs, a member of social assistance services in Bayern, and addresses, among other things, the topic of women in the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all enlightened women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munichan women's aid.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even not as a visitor.
The exception is a guardian in front of the door.
"It is not too excessive to say: Every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened torture or death or because their families send them as a hoper to Europe," she says.
Women consider other reasons for escape: "Many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsory sight, honor murder, slavery or compulsory prostitution.
That's what's going on.
It's going on on the escape.
"The sleeper, for example, demands a sexual action for a bottle of water, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, misfortune, says Bahr.
Even here alone women in refugee accommodations would often be considered less valuable and worst abused.
This causes some 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north to be traumatic.
"Some of the children have certainly not been voluntarily created."
Many women are used to say nothing.
"Of they do not trust in speaking openly about the experience because the shame is too big."
Since they often do not know how to help, more accommodations are needed only for them, Bahr requests.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the occupation of refugees.
The question is whether they know about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.
There is no such thing in government accommodation in the upper hall and in the upper Francis.
Even in Schwaben, flourished women alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In upper Bavaria, sub- and medium-sized francs there are floors or own houses in some Community accommodations only for lonely women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be separated from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately."
"If the privacy fails or men and women are brought together, it can come to - continued - violence against women."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is found in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be found at the Andrang, which is on the house in Munich.
"There has been a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistants struggle: demands for new labour struggle measures
Deputy representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to authorise new work fighting measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to adopt more work struggle measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that Ministers had failed to address the concerns relating to the contract.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "continually quiet" on problems, which led to the refusal of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and request official negotiations for all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today has submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work struggle, starting at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the six-fold striking of assistant doctors this year, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed members of BMA during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be favourable and accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsoryly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and to announce an official end of the eight months persistent war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't dismiss the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handslag, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed tiny and he scattered hardly warm, even for his retaining conditions.
Recept Tayip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted like never happened anything bad.
His enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.
But a puntin-expressed, sustainable cooling showed that the Head of State of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the departure of a Russian battle plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was burned.
Putin divided out and accused Ankara to have fallen Russia in the back.
It was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vetrau will be difficult, if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed like the Turks would be blamed for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of executive officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria areas that are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He struggled this fifteen.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to pay a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a state of arms are clearly at hand.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed last month at a failed state section nearly his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia, travel organs and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They are counted on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti wrote it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West because it considers its response to the attempted power takeover as a weak response.
This is why the persistent grill comes over the rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is insisting on taking advantage of the cool mood and reducing the relationship between Turkey and the West.
The Russian Head of State surely won a bonus in Ankara for requesting support for the chosen state bodies after the attempted state stretch.
This is well-known for Moscow, a self-consciousness that has a deeply seated fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this glossy palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analytic once described me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries who are disfellowshipped and disregarded from the west and now being bound.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still considerable differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first discussion, both Presidents at the press conference said that they had not even struck the topic.
The President of Turkey did not deliberately answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to highlight it.
There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found to Syria.
But after months of open enemies - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than the NATO member of Turkey dismissed the Russian battle chain - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least speak with each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The trade mark RBS is intended to be reduced to a backoffice roll, according to the bank's head of director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
Since then, the bank has distanzed when it had to be collapsed and saved almost eight years ago.
At that time, trademark streets "RBS" used to protect other final consumer financial marks.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the exchange notation will change to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be more important - coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in Invernessshire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The brand RSB will be our investment mark and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we become more a bank of brands now."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will be perfectly different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue his Six Nation Sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of trademarks, because how are we focusing inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches his 3000th profit at Newmarket on Prediction
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings it 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured its 3000 British profit on Friday at Newmarket.
He put on Prediction, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second profit of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey who reaches the milestone in the Flach race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 200,000 people.
I'm so easy and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jubilee when he gets the victory on Prediction
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-monthly retired winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derbysieger had 4.493 Career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that has only reached a few before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactic intellect that distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma enthusiasm, enthusiastic fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he had already earned 6,000 wins if he weren't just a weekend and big tower jockey!
Frankie has been riding in GB for nearly 30 years winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the cover sign of the British Flach race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of large towers, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, survived a aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had problems at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defend and return to his best form.
And he is not at the end of a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competition until his at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov
Unexpectedly, the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Staff Chairman Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest trust circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Creml, Putin has been appointed chairman of the Russian Presidial Administrative Board for his duties, without giving reasons for the release of Ivanov.
Anton Vaino, who since 2012 was Ivanovs Stellvertreter, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he completed the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later the Head of Protocol and Staff of the Government Staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as Head of State in relation to draft law and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step made Moscow mysterious wovens.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As a Staff Chief, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast in the television, both men claimed that the Staff boss resigned on his own wish.
But despite the smile for the cameras, here are only few convinced - especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one currently knows that.
But the official claim - that a man, once praised as a potential President, wished to lead the Russian environmental policy - was a major skepsis.
In his comments on Putin, quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me these very complex posts - you could almost say - complaining posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was formerly Vice-President and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his chairman.
As Putin, he came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office of Putin would have infringed the constitution.
But this post was taken by another, nearby alliance of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, before he again became president of three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit the producers
Gibson was involved in a physical conflict in the set of series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, proclaimed his cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, excused himself publicly on Thursday before his announcement.
At the set there were artistic differences and a difference in opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out from the series followed by a team of FBI agents, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who once played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first pillar of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart blood in the last 12 years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can want for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelve pillars is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A inhabitant of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals sprayed out by a spring brown.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectrum in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected to fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossings with the viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck leaves", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10.000 tonnes of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 scarlets.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed until May 2017.
Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epical measure in this project with more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a thick activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passing.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a Betonus for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents a future high and depth construction.
After the installation of the last road cover section and its connection with the north tower cover, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern lever bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very narrow activity.
Massive, as the viadukt is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tonnes weighed and had to be drawn up at an increase of about 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances to which the team worked were small - on each side they only amounted to a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Luck to be alive"
Three men have "Luck to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfror RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming safely while their boat moved on with their own power.
"We saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst thing," said the leader of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat except their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fisherman boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a boje hanging without a rescue west.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have uninjured happiness and still being alive.
Although the boat engine had a emergency stop line, it was dissolved when the boat was chopped off from the person who managed the boat.
Someone watched these men today.
He's hurt - man stands on his ex-friend in
A man has attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and hurt hard.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized actors cut the clothes of his ex-friend.
When this came into the apartment, he went into her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothes of his ex-friend, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she and her companion went out of the house.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women joined the apartment again, the 50-year-old swamped his sister to side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPDs and the Greens believe that investors will be much more obliged in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "administration concept" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who is going to build the favourable apartments?
There is no regulation until now.
Christoph Bratmann says, "We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must prove to be social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also be found in stock.
However, the major issue in the Councilhouse is, as Bratmann says, "How is it to deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing funding programme that will cost millions and still need to be financed is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as little as possible rules.
The left wants more hard orders for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, there was a sharpness of the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the experts.
However, the programme is not entire: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of some 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will take place in the next few years?
Until 2020, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, so as the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, outgoing bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about getting apartments back to the price bond.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem was solved on a struggle.
For in the western city, the end of the year expires.
About 1800 apartments can be retrieved back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners do not want the housing companies.
Because the number of social dwellings in the western city is again drasticly increased, one is removed from the objective of the so-called interference.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
President Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
Although they focused on more building places for single family houses.
But what does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness worth
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenagers and children are not going to play out anymore but prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, many have been complained in recent decades.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was at first on the TV, then limited to video games and last to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities outside are not excluded from each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (from then there were a series of drawings, game cards and other spin-offs).
How many popculture phenomena did the interest before publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was suspended by the massive demand overloaded by the servers.
Within few days Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, once they were found, can be "fotografed" (with a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "caught".
A generation that played the game when she was still younger joined the asshole and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "mean" person resigns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people following training 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who Pokémon Go plays of it - it only sees raw data to increase performance.
Many public information campaigns to health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time," "to come from sofa" and "to be active every day" stood on deaf ears, because many public news to health are boring and come from people who look evil.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of being sick of cancer or depression.
Body activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to put them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air, sunlight and fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
Like always, there are murrical gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit had previously been able to follow our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new will lose his race and the use will leave with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the activation in the real world and will help many people hunting to be more active, frightened and healthy.

Simone Biles creates gold in damenturing
Forget the pressure.
Forget the Hype.
Simone Biles is immune.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
It's hard on the bar.
Respiratory on the ground.
It's brilliant.
And now, finally, olympiasiasm.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed on Thursday to multifight title and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" manship companion Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American girls Simone Biles turn on the sweep bar during the single merchandise of women in the artistic towers at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and totals the fifth, while attaching her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts it in the same League as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
In the last three years, Biles has dominated her sports type, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - won with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Girl of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a last review in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.
Not returning back to the family with a handful of gold in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.
The American girls Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman surrounded each after they won gold and silver in the single merchants of women in the art towers at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the celebration of the retirement coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on it, while their long way to the top, never planned the future, that is not really true.
A part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - is voted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a chance.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child, and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the turnhall, in which Boorman trained.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more battle competition, a victory series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led lightly through two rotations, the image was deceived.
Swing bars and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship - loud.
She retired with 15.433 on the sweaving bar again - and put another one on the floor with a 15.933.
Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her end - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles glowing red, white and blue Eyelines, when the vision she once described in her collection book became real.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called the Americans "Oma", had a predecessor.
After her soil exercise, she threw to the audience cossing hands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As regards Biles, the rapidly spreading two of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning:
Police: Shot 3 victims in serial murder cases when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who had died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murdering of Phoenix while they interviewed and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The acter fired eight shots from a handfire gun, while he stood on the bicycle side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police told that the three-fold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the pockets or the $2.900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the investigators to get a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed and two more were injured in hispanic residents within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a living area before a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, in the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died due to their injuries.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the ground.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the three-fold murder and was assumed that it was the work of the serial murderer.
The investigators found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his older companions, Edmund Microzephalia has the result of a genetic disturbance that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't.
I can't do this.
I didn't give up for that.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've been admitted to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that people still do," explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walk.
Edmund could not sit or crush until his third year of life and he cannot still speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought for "Sing something for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some signs alone.
Microzephalia has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as mashes or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the forecast for a long time because I don't expect anybody to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding causes salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and huge floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is estimated the whole Saturday with more rainfall.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large floods for extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the way to help the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood-flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will be at all probability after the weekend record level.
The metreologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overflow many houses in the nearby Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downward flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will be flowing over the rivers that are hit in the Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever recorded on Friday at 09:00.
In the southwest of Mississippi, the rescue teams still pitched people from the river water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson, were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly overnight.
He said that another step son who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We were waking up and the water streamed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my Taille.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers all three had saved in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were placed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "throughly spread" as there were still heavy rainfall and that the authorities were insisting on evacuation instructions.
Krautmann reported a observer near Livingstone from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly filled through the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons in five school districts.
The CBS daughter-sender WWL reported that a member in Tangipahoa reported 200 overflowing houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The chief of the municipality Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pet animals that were spoiled by high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuateds.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back into their houses," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality Tangipahoa, almost two thousand roads were closed due to the high water and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city management.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said that it continued to rain at the Gulf Coast.
According to its information, a handful of houses should have been reported as overflowed on Thursday, but no one has been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "through bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the landing, legs, arms and stomach, but that he was aware of his carriage to the hospital.
"He has made a lot through, his small body was leaked by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to perform several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to cure again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Likewise, three men were shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in a stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the broadcaster.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just determined whether one of the injured men of the actors could be.
Explorers informed CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to have come a crossfire between several protectors.
Cartridges for storm guns, which were tracked back to various storm guns, overlooked the door.
It seems that this has clearly been a permanent struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walking road, there were hills.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," the police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-counter on the arm when she played before her house in the vicinity of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspicious.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining under the women's olympia team in the tower and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer Olympia since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
Secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauuren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds around, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments was an afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby #1 and #2 were.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympia winner and American.
Now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but master gymastic routes.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but that's how tour classes do not look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team.
They are the "Last five", because the next Olympia team will only have four tournaments in the team. In addition, this is last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality appears that towers are an expensive sport and tournament is primarily in private tournament associations that are maintained by parents for training, establishment, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their towers and families). The list can be continued anywhere.
The majority of these tournament associations are in prosperous premises that can support the business.
In these associations, the towers receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started the tour.
We need to allow the municipalities to be able to train with Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more viable and easy to access.
I founded my 20-year turn Foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tour in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer the youth high quality tour that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and definiteness for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and for educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tower and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by picking the olympic crew gold and thanks, you have so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to begin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further stresses after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functioners of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted at a election rejected him.
In July Hunt planned to introduce the contract compulsoryly and said that the NHS could be in a "Nemandsland" and any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at young times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistants, shared in a communication last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will raise the current employee crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time goes out.
As a result of the BMA's efforts to solve the disputes through discussions, government has been able to engage in opposition and sometimes on ear-depth silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month about his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, raise the force and respond to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a suspension of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike mail chain coverage.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association functioners.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeid fighting measures do not achieve only a few, but are already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nurses and their families only concerns, emergency and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other Ministry to the concerns relating to the premencement and whistleblowing.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatching, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a working time, training cards, mutual recognition of the education plan, educational leave and sex-specific wage cases in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of cardiac infarction patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to give this more people for a longer period.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated cardiac infarction for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140.000 people are suffering a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffers another heart attack or a stroke.
Cardiac attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fattening materials in the species walls that form sites.
When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that stops the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and hide the blood flow into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are under a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft instructions by NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people suffering a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disasterous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack may have significant adverse effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness blows up electoral fraud in Muslim areas
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption from the Office
A culture of political correctness has led to the knowledge that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is clearly ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles will soon attack the police, electoral observers and council houses for ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitiveness regarding ethnic and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off lockbands outside of election cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should lead a certificate to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a elector must only name his name and address.
The report suggests that a person's finger should be taken on a non-removal ink when they give up its vote in order to prevent someone from selecting twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He urges the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official civil champion Lutfur Rahman should be withdrawn after a Lithuanian of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he would have brought his critics to silence with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have "had led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses other than anyone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he said alarmingly to the deceitful choice of letters - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community, it would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the conduct of licences to prove the identity
His report states: "As a proof of the pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, has been applied to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladesh background.
"There was anxiety that... State institutions would have ignored such a behavior because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop "woulding".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration reviews to prevent the use of the catalogue of choices for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers for your certificate before you choose.
Use non-removal ink on the finger of a person as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone from selecting twice.
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are voting rights.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letter selections and conversions of letter elections.
The police will be empowered to set up locks for election stations.
A legislative amendment which facilitates a prosecution for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrepresentation Act 1983).
Photography ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (with the exception of Wales).
Increasing the training to ensure that employees regularly use the electoral to go to the choice cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "awesome" that no punishment was made after Torrent Hamlet's case.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his chairman for corrupt and illegal practices because of Lithuania," he said.
It was known guilty - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings - due to a number of reasons.
It also criticizes the ineffective "abhac checks" of the electoral registration departments of the council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the Parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Wicked by Kate's bicycler and other famous double gangers of Olympia sporters in Rio
This week, fans of the Olympia 2016 in Rio are admitted to the French bike sporter Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the edge and band, who proved to be an impressive double ganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionic this summer is far not the only one to fight gold athlete, who has his own famous double ganger - at least not if you are allowed to give faith to the social media.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flinging on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood's fames.
The Jäger and the Wolf: the team member of the U.S. Manship in the Arcic Shooter Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprico
Apart from Kate's double ganger on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow guard of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprico could be.
The team member of the U.S. manship in the Arcic Shooter Brady Ellison has caused an announcement on Twitter after seeing pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star incredibly similar.
Actually, the bow guard came with the madness of social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I myself do not see a great similarity, except the face-hearing," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'm complimenting it."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused on this year: the increasing similarity between the British widespringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be a double ganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African Summer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One walk higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actress
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and the actress Josh Hartnett, who has similar severe eyebrows and lips.
The Russian Silver Medal Swemmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sunny-born skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans, as a "atletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Stark women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the American football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost the same as the actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tower of Gabby Douglas, who shows her own beautiful, wide smile that is similar to Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologize for his statement that Chinese swimming girl "as a pig died"
Byron MacDonalds Analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m free-style swimtafleter reluctant of the CBC life transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "as a mob" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swamp.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like mob, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimed the second stage of the swimming pool 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which enabled the Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Watchers throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "as a pig died"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on shipping."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how sensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC shipment, excused himself lively for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately selected formulation, we're sorry it happened."
At the end, CBC excused more than 90 times for the people who responded to the notice via Twitter
The commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his excuse for more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also excused quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be radiated.
We quickly excused us for sending and followers in the social media last night with our viewers.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimming woman and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were unpleasant and unfortunately selected formulation. Byron is very sorry what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald excused himself in the consignment and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it would be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the woman's swemming stubborn in the CBC Olympisendance, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimming woman and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intentional and I'm very sorry."
Purchasers in Primark distressed about woman who tests in the middle of the business shameless underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took out her clothes in the midst of a pricing to try underheads.
To make the situation worse, she mourned, as she looked in it, she pulled out and put it back into the hall.
She continued and tried four pairs of underhoses in a business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the undershoes before she put her back to the hall
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "he was releasing and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of undershoes from the exhibition, pulled out her own pants and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a little more discrete place to do it - she was just standing there, freaking like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the undershoes again, which apparently did not like her, because she put them back into the hall."
She repeated the same thing with three more undershoes before finally decided that she didn't like anything, reared and went out.
"You didn't seem to interrupt that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the undershoes she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take underheads home that had another person and were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I received, the employees have tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she went - what is equally good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of undershoes and find out that another woman had her and washed again and she wasn't washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Kraven Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major champion of Maga Verbande's Requirement in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers in close distance.
Depending on whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the spit for your robber.
If you approach you from the back, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbows in the face.
Then hit him with the knee and turn back, while the attacker crumbs for pain, the gun out of his hands. Beat him with the run into the face and move back while they direct the gun to him.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
Move the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker on the breast, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move backwards and direct the gun on it.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But remember that it is safest for a robbery to make your money - unless you are not a requirement Maga Grandmaster.
Travelers Ian Wright can give a travel guide his tongue at the most dirty places of Europe
A British traveler undertook his immune system and wurgereflex of a serious examination - by defeating some of the most dirty and unreasonable places of Europe.
The Moderator and Travel Author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, made his trains on a Euro-Shine, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a spoil button on a train towel and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will leave.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of swallowing the spoil button of a train towel, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely absent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical experts about the promotion of darmbacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he swallowed, more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his darm by traveling through the world, and by eating extraordinary and wonderful things.
From public countries at railway stations to spoil buttons from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the movie he said, "I was relatively unanimous as a child as regards my health and I put all the possible things in my mouth, Earth, Wurms and Slamwater."
In the movie, he was justified in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample decline showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak off after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "It comes close to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to look at this because it's in there.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company is awarding Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of darmbacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, soaps and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to view and at the same time explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with saying, "Let's call us Ian."
They claim that the interest in brain health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of brain health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in darm health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide more information to the consumer in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the government of the movie, added: "Let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had instructed him to leak, like the ignorant Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to dress them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we have taken some of these dirty funny stuff on movies."
In a survey carried out by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all the milk acid bacteria interviewed, in particular, associated with the well-being of stomach and tarm and 58 percent, said that they at least sometimes use products containing added milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delogy with a damage of £50.000 because she had terroristized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints by their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden pieces were shaken, waste was distributed on the floor and the grave fiti was cut on the walls.
The family has been resided and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment should no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is robbed and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had encountered included road fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, disputes and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the leasing contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be cut off, old waste was found
In the presence of drugs in the past, the wooden parts were scraped up
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partners this week violently from the property after she gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The delogy was admired by familiar neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One said, "They were crying around nobody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The incredible times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not us used!
Now when they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have abandoned the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called regularly for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant forsumed to assume any responsibility for their behavior and that of her family, since a delogy is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogy on the ground
Workers of household management will now have to remove waste mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police took a razzia in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as weights, paraphernalines and cash amounts of £1.700.
Skeldon received a penalty after she had known guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in order to trade.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 at a car accident.
After they were without arch, Tanya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were filled with Graffiti.
The police say she'll delegate leases who don't follow the order
Angela Crow from Devon Police and Cornwall announced that the delogy was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the order.
"This is true of those who think that they can behave without themselves and those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are paniced after a deeply flying military jet beach
Solar worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force Air Forces set an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but persistent that no safety risk was present
This was the moment when feared tourists began to panic after a deep flying jet crashed down over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military plane was flying near the sunbeds on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The vacationists jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the dish drives, without first to see what came to them through the clouds.
The event occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidays who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By into the social media, said: "It was really very deep over two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly flying deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet, due to the bad visibility conditions, was slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces persistent that security was not at any time threatened.
Area burns have destroyed parts of the Portuguese continent this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply as a result of the circumstances - strong fool and fire smoking - which restricted his viewpoint
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday about the first step to the first title gain in the new football season.
The Catalans join the duell around the Spanish supercup towards the FC Sevilla, the replay increases three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must avoid Neymar in force with the underlying cupinalist and governing Europe League champion, among other things, which contradicts the Olympic Football Turnier with Brazil.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing for steps.
The German suffered a tape breaking in the knee in training, with at least first explained the question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and ter steps have been fighting in Barcelona for two years for the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique rejected a clear decision so far and left Bravo in the League, but ter steps in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new game time, there is doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humbled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the sample galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know to convince.
On the other hand, Sevilla has to devour the 2:3 downlage after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives to the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a own League to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tischtennis Olympiasier.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "Title Defense" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5.4,4).
Thus, the World Order List first picked up the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at WM, World Cup, World-Tour Final Turniers and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have done it as expected in the end game and made the title among themselves.
This was clear that for the third time in success, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia Trip was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had withdrawn to the Tribune and left their guardians in fair competition alone.
"The matches up to here I have played for my country."
"I play in the final for me," Zhang said folly.
After the batch, gold and silver medal winners posted with the China-fahne.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he decided the speed on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Through the superiority of Mother, the anticipating match was not developed.
But nevertheless, it was sufficient to see breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game about bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The White Russian had caused a rib injury to the German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov in his quartal final, afterwards in medical treatment, to "last" with Blech.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become in similar high tennis ages of Olympia.
Donald Trump explodes ′′-wide problems′′ in the electoral struggle
The leadership of the U.S. republics is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative state states, of their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now acknowledged weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous republikan Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which, as correspondents reported, the generous and self-safe multi-millionary multi-millionary expressed anxiety.
After throwing 16 rivals from the race within its own republikan camp, the doubts of his success are now growing in the battle for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians he asked for support in important state such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Indeed, if false reports about his candidature, he resumed his known media scenarios.
Republican Hochburgen wackeln
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were straightforward.
Other institutions see Trump in front, but not with the distance used for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered dangerous.
In an interview by the Sender CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's premarch again: "Genauso, as I have done so far."
And push backwards: this will "beother be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation."
He does nothing but "telling the truth".
If it is not rich for him at the end because of political correction, it's all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is supposed to have threatened to strike money for supporting his electoral struggle, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for the Congress will be more deprived of the arms.
Olympia: Trinish fraud in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenias Lightathlets are threatening after the second Doping shop at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Unmach.
After a fraud attempt in a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee communicated to a disciplinary Commission to examine the case immediately.
A Kenyan functioner had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, gave a urine test under the name of the 800 meter runner Ferguson Redich.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers by the team leader Kenyas.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC for information about the case to endeavour its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, made the sample and signed," said Kenias Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was owned by the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing WM-vierer.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leichtathletics delegation manager Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of his country's ongoing doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation in the IOC after numerous doping processes for a long time.
When announced by the IOC more than 2000 Doping target controls before the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the show.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, to create an anti-doping law and a working control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start.
As a result, the WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fighting is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The lightathlets of the country won most medals at the WM 2015 in Beijing.
In a number of ARD television reports, it has been repeatedly argued that there is easy access to Kenia Doping funds and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian lightathletics.
It was demonstrated that in this sports type, there was a widespread and systematically popped.
Russia's lightathlets were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classics and fulfill a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the leadership of the venezonal director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their speed and melodia.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scenario Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musical extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She looks very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honor for us to work with her.
She's an incredible generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Managing is a need for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the U.S. director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is high-actual: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as pronounced today as then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the ballwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to their family's information, shortly after she had planned to leave the war-bowed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that this are the risks associated with going into a war area - people will stop taking this decision ever," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London went into a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became widow within few months.
Reid says that in the case of a election victory at Garland, Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The republikans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next President will designate the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Garland to choose "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker of Reid later said that he wouldn't have talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't take care of trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that republicans blocked the Nomination of Garlands, were Lacay and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate to the President's office.
Treats wants naked kalendar for "women and for men"
The Treats Magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970-year-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The manager of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from Old School Playboys as "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
Apparently he believes that the calendar does.
"We must return to representing timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally on open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated with mass flight
"Whoever does not fit and praise Erdogan, is sitting on packed bags," says the chairman of the Golden-Night Foundation Dialog and World, Ercan Karacoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany is short-term with tens of thousands of protective seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "one hundred thousand," the Association Chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the hard course of the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan after the Putsch attempt, the Kurdish municipality Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count on tens of thousands, medium-term with some hundred thousand seekers of protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and democratic opposition," says the Association Chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the Government had already transferred Kurdish High Citizens to criminal action months ago, 500 000 Kurds within Turkey were on their escape.
After the negotiated Putsch, still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees in its own country produces refugees," said Toprak.
The Federal Head complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the excursion to the remaining Kurdens.
"You are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been extinct or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Federal Government called for the Federal Government to position itself "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its trailers".
In Germany there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in the last months for the first time in Germany.
The German branch of the Golden Movement also fears the escape of many Turks to abroad.
More Turks will search for asylum in Germany, especially Kurden and Oppositionelle.
The brand marking as a valid trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not fit and praise Erdogan, is sitting on packed bags, elsewhere also the chemaists and seculars," said Ercan Karacoyun, chairman of the golden foundation dialogue and education, the "world".
According to the newspaper on the figures of the Federal Ministry, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum legitimates recognised for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
In June 30, this was 11.386 people and thereby almost 29 percent of all recognised as asylum (39.625).
This survey does not find the flooded before war, poverty, or perspectivelessness.
Asylum justified under the basic law is exclusively political, i.e. by the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it works"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer-walk struggle - and the holidays from Nordrhein-Westfalen are not allowed to choose the landday.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommers they understood.
In 2021 the country-day election will not take place directly at the end of summer holidays, the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's more dumb than so far: summer holidays, heat and land day election fight - that's biting.
The locals who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are in vacation.
The most of the holidays that are in the country, on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hidedensee, are not residents, so may not choose the landday.
Consequently, there are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers hanging up, blowing airballons, distributing airplanes and counting voices are only effortful.
By 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to be able to overcome a election struggle near the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in surveys clearly behind the CDU.
Splendidly, how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition amazing.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, has been making a almost inconceivable election struggle, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, spreads roses and plucks a little with the people, as it has already done his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, the soul ring has got cold feet and gives Kanzler Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the legal populations, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, the Inner Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you make a election fight at the wrong time at the right place.
She has invited Kanzler Angela Merkel for large-scale customers twice; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berliner and Sachsen there than Mecklenburger and prepommers.
"It was probably the majority of other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also harms anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU is largely dismissed from the usual elections on markets and before shopping centres with sunscreens and airballers.
That, so thinks, only play a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it breaks away the base on the country that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are going like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the broadness of the country hardly exist.
However, the Council of the CDU Champion Cokert to his fellow struggles is also self-declared: "You must go to where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is in the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a specially engaged election struggle.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, were supposed to create the jump in the land day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday note and mostly move their electoral struggle into the Internet.
"Online Championship," it calls the president of Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral strugglers are seeking tracks for local voting citizens among the vacationists.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is basketing through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still enjoying it.
Their impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 sanitation: Guest facilities suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is cleaned, there is nothing to make.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 p.m. and ends at 20 p.m., there is plenty of praise.
"They have made everything pretty tricky," says Elvira Tetzlaff about the Jet tank station.
This is a super team.
There's no move, too.
At the beginning of the week, the building station could be moved to the south at the time of the semi-time, until the end of October, everything is supposed to be finished.
It is also advocated that the constituents responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of assistance.
Since the construction site has been turned to south on Monday and the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted up and the connection to Rottenburg has thus been restored, the transport situation within the place has relaxed.
Citizens are now able to travel back from often things from the B 27.
It seems that the refugee traffic through the place is declined.
"There were partially significant complaints," says the vice-president of Florian King responsible for the traffic-technical management of the renewal.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more trailers, because many roads were searching for and familiar with their Navi rather than the description.
What led to some trucks in residential areas.
As the speed limits were not observed, the municipality called for the measurement vehicle from moussing.
"There were significant overrides," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation.
Two to three have been bleededed per minute.
The fastest was travelling with 77 hours in the speed-30-zone.
Since the construction site has continued, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg is the road again open.
Looking in the cards is unwilling to see businessmen.
But that the B 27 sanitation has led them to sales breaks, everyone who is asking will look through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Whoever has to do with the "end customers" less, that is to produce for other companies, for which the renewal has hardly consequences.
At the Mayer car house, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "most light decline", but also admits that of course "the course lacks".
The locals are the most frequently exploited along the street.
J. Albert Göner, the owner of the steakhouse, formerly krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all guest places hit it "hart".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about any euro turnover.
The fines are "wide more than 50 percent".
The road invasion has "returned its operation for two years".
Half of his employees he had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half was released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has answered to a question by Gohner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the guests otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now they have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Gohner knows from other landscapes, where such a more generous operation was carried out.
For all complaints, Gohner is sure that his guest place will remain.
Finally, the family operation has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.
The fact that other family guests are less frequently overlooked because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't ride out, it's pretty somewhere else.
At the end of the renovation work, Gohner has no doubts about the return of his family clients.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird grips, Gohner holds the effects of B 27 construction work on his customership for the greatest crisis that his host site has experienced in its long-term history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
In the name of terrorist fighting, laws are constantly screwed.
After the recent attacks, the Inner Minister de Maizière now submits a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals are 'politically acceptable' to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in the imagination of his new security package.
They don't blame anyone.
Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also share in it.
However, as a minister of the interior, he is on results and on a "real consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time before presenting its conclusions for the security of the Republic.
But they are now far more profound.
Something is already known, announced, felt that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Even not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements to air passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video monitoring and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, the Maizière starts a second approach to proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish the sympathy of terrorist groups and Djihadists with double citizenship to cut off the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
However, he considers this to be acceptable and does not require anything that does not have any chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partly in itself: He plans fast procedures for displacements and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before departure.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and release social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum candidates, he wants to make some more worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or discard their papers consciously in order to distort their identity.
Some of these are political and legally soft.
Some of them also act unequivocally and leave questions open.
And in some points, for example, in the inequality of patience, the question is, what does this really have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the topics of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, in view of the high refugee numbers, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people were deeply busy weren't allowed to climb in election times.
Internal security has been greatly focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in the field of internal security.
In the last few days, there went high between the two parties.
Only a violent dispute on the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy ideas collection of some Union ministers, in which the Heads of Resort also demand a Burka ban and a return from the double citizenship.
The Maizière also strives here for pleasant sounds.
He doesn't hold anything from a return from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You're gonna reopen it, don't be meaningful.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a lot of things in there that could cause dispute.
But also the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Head of Party Sigmar Gabriel first signals careful conversation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increases in security."
People's cars are still going through glimpsely.
Despite Diesel Candals, delivery numbers rise worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
In the callback action, there's a concept of the Whirl.
Volkswagen starts at the delivery of more behavior in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest autobuilder can continue to present a plus in the past year, despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July the core brand VW was weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again charged the total sales, as the company listed in Dax announced.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China, the second-important market, sales were 14 per cent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, the delivery was slightly slightly a six-stage.
The trademark manager Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures from July, mainly, to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a rescue of purchases in some core markets through "modified economic conditions".
In addition to the situation around the punishment attempt in Turkey, the British vote has also stressed the EU's exit, an speaker explained.
In the United States, where the waste gas shop first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the most affected homemark of the Lower Saxony candle continues glimpsely by the Diesel Candal: After the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 per cent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kapler could continue to present a salesplus from January to July.
1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered people's cars at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
People's cars had manipulated with a software gas test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for re-equipment to the workshops.
During the reconstruction, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars does not have any negative effects.
In the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deterioration is made after the re-establishment of the vehicles.
The autobuilder shall issue a "guarantee equal" certificate after reconstruction, but does not speak of a "Garantie", as it was called in business circles on Friday.
Reasons are jurisdictions.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants his German customers a guarantee for re-established diesel models.
This would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives of the Federal Transport Ministry.
The Transport Ministry confirmed that this meeting was held.
"VW has to meet the requirements of my Examination Commission and the KBA in full."
"Deviations of this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
The VW has assumed that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after re-establishing and all type-approval-related vehicle values have been unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "Garantie" as it was said in business circles.
With the wide term "Garantie", people's cars see the possibility that customers, for example, a half year after the re-equipment, come into a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of customers to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste gas candal comes into an uncertainty regarding possible guarantee schemes, as it said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "Garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at Tegernsee requires rich savings for future penalties - as a second institution in Germany.
On Thursday, Lieutenant Joseph Paul said: "It is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts."
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banken speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: Normal savings should "not be afraid to pay for their sparrow penalty".
Stocks Banks Money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to September of private and company customers for deposits over 100 000 euros on giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100.000 euros are free."
"The next 100.000 will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.
He has been guarding for 40 million euros for a period of time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he could not recover.
"They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't add for every million, 4000 euros."
He is now giving the costs in accordance with the Consumer Principle.
The cash would be too dangerous to leave in the screws of the Raiffeisenbank, "I've experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth one yet," said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of installation.
Only a few wandered to other banks.
The Association of Cooperatives Bayern explained: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks."
To bear them alone, "will not be permanently possible in business".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made records with its tax bank-filial 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the head of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay large charges for deposits, thereby the competition in Germany among banks and spare banks is much too strong."
One banker said that at the Tegernsee there is "a clientel that is something more exquisite from the property".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if she keeps money free of charge.
The 1911 cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Familiar actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Association of Cooperatives Bayern "are currently not known for any other banks that calculate a deposit payment for private customer deposits," said Speecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not let this fall into the width.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound plates?
Uniform men in the middle age love plates.
Before you hurry to comment part to oversee him under the pseudonumber NotAllSaint MenMedlerenAlters with raw injuries, this statement depends on current data.
According to YouGov, the highly discussed resurrection of sound plates is not on a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical items, but is due to Midlife nostalgie.
Those who recently bought a plate are all prospects in the age of 45 to 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has a emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov?
If this blog had been a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I ran in the middle of a business street in Soho, wear a modest grey dress and steal wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something definitely like, "So, let us throw a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart Sohos slowly blows in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one-time independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate special stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of various men in such businesses and try to evaluate their age and compassion by monitoring.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men in the middle age) into Reckless Records (Data Number: eight men in the middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I guess," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, represented above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), clothe the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and ploughed.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25 working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet meet the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have been able to see themselves buy their old plates again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people have usually released around 1998 or 1999 their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the adherents of the plate revival of a given age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that record business offers a calm community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took insist on the contactless payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw themselves back to the stability of trusted soundboard cabinets, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think it can sometimes be filling a blank or the possession of material owners than a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like me as a collector, and I think it's like that for many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" flies a employee from a plate stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a plate last month have not yet belonged to them.
The survey also found that 41% owns a plate player that they never use, while 7% of those buying a plate do not own a plate player.
At this time of the news report, I'd probably look very concerned while blowing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of average age), has noticed a "Trophenaspect" of the Revival.
"Nobody just came in here recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead soundboard so that I can put it in the roll," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it happens definitely.
More product-loaded, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plate player."
These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bunt audience when I go in.
There are pairs around the 70 tourists who make photos, teenage boys and women in the middle age.
Although the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
No one of them looks strangely lonely, but close psychiatric traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and viewing the variation of the plates for sale.
She's making a show window bubble rather than a big shopping.
She does not deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives off with a loved soup.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last hold is a business that is said that a new generation of plate lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to mourn the Jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they're just decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "Plattenkunst".
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as plates.
Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are voting, they, at least in record businesses in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors and album lovers who exist in reality, record business and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They're not sure to spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bombing by the Berwick Street plates and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the staring view of an unclean 30-year-old false moder, who's not going to be on the shoulders of an unprecedented middle age.
The Greenland Hai is the longest living whirlley - Video report
Scientists say that the Grönlandhai has the longest life span of all the crustaceans on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines Haie, says that the record was at a female, which is assumed that it was between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court rejects the offer of departure of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer of the authorities in Calais to decline dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to deprive 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the warehouse are goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer freezer services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefectur Calais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would store a fire and sanity risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the Court that shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the Stately supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the stock.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the excursion of people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of Calais' prefecture were "absolutely feasible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who live "in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the rainstorm was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is well-employed and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, uncommon minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure "for these children would be a disaster, of which the recent eight years of age."
The two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle was increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase in new arrivals during summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic Time Travel, Radprof Tony Martin would not want to be undercovered.
"I continue to look at the WM, remain confident and fight on," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelve place on the sugar hat.
"I really find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time riding," said Martin.
He had to analyze the reasons for the Debakel.
At the time ride WM in Qatar in October, Martin wanted to fight about the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-month world champion who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 45,5 km of the Olympia Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siemund missed semi-finale
The victory of Laura Siemund ended in Rio's quartal final: The World Originists-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the half-final of the Olympic Tennis tournament.
Siemund, which was suffered by back problems, could only carry out its resort once and worked without power compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medal Hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping into the front round.
The Australian-Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
As the last German tennis professor, Tommy Haas had picked up a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters in the quarterly final of summer games had been given last 1992.
A German duo was never standing in an Olympic single halffinal.
Groups increase at startup for live video game transfers
Looking at other people when playing video games is a riecenter - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam that specialized in this hobby.
The amount of money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and has already more than 100.000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene.
For example, they can give up missions to the players, face enemies and provide equipment items.
The player's Activision Bliizzard starts a new HD video service for the thriving world of the e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already watching.
The employees of the start-up, which has their seat in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, move to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founders and -Chef Matt Salsamndi announced.
Consequently, for customers, the acquisition should not change anything.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to set up to the next generation speed meters: In various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested that are particularly effectively intended to transfer temposünders.
For example, the futurist-acting enforcement trailer of Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used at accidental gravities where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway buildings or to sancing bridges with temporary tempolite there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blister to comply with the speed limitation.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or exhaustive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days during uninterrupted measurement, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measuring technology allows all vehicles to be collected over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limitations as well as transit bans after time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk mode, you can move the trailer according to manufacturers with each car with a trailer.
In order not simply to be stolen, he has been reduced in the measurement operation, so the wheels are disappearing in the pitched and other shot-safe outdoor cabinet.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested and used since 2015, according to the information provided by Vitronic in different federal countries.
Foreign authorities also flits with the new technique: France has recently ordered 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji MasterClass picks Gold
The impressive performance of the Great Britain at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop in the final Thursday evening at the last hit in the form of the Fijis, when they were hit with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in the handling, side-stepping, rearing, line run, and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamedal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of the Silver Medal - the fourth of Britain this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they slew New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-finale on the same day could fall back to it in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis Chieftrainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind.
Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here she just lost one.
This sludge will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and made the attacks of GBs go out of passion.
It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. would be running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up to 5,00 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai put another attack out of the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
A great takle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the reappearance and there was still over a minute of time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached by further weak taklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.
It's like that.
GB made basic changes in half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game left long to the benefit of the South Sea Islands, whose fans sang, flags swing and danced on the Tribune.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliam put the i-touch with another attempt in the last seconds.
The piff told me, the Fijis were embarrassing, and GB shot destructively into the races.
Earlier on the day Fiji had seized Japan in the semi-finale with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a little semi-final match from the race - United Kingdom's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late thankling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the carcinogenic cancer of the trainer to roder seal
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it means.
From the first hit to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enters history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they reigned to the second Olympiagold in the two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of the British sports, who laid such a measure.
Their dominance was absolutely, however, her 39th unattended use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that glide over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the type of triumph to grace.
Behind every gold in the ropes, a bataillon is on willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no helper than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was a risk.
I had bubble cancer that is operational and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, what the interrupt was at a minimum, if under such circumstances it was at all the right concept.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
It is already a challenge to ruin itself, but that makes it even greater.
In the immediateness of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than otherwise and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional wreck this week. This is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."
It repeats just how much that means me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you for him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "bly in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to be inclined.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for doing something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions on his future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, their own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic Championship.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years an example of clarity
The manager of the "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered 'bayer-wide example'.
A small franc drinking water combination as an example for the large water producers.
This was the original tone in a contribution from the Bayeric broadcast a few days ago.
A few later, the water forum of the government of subfrancs valued the purpose association.
The work of the Vetenstein group was "bayer-wide as an example."
Reaching all of this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years of employee, is 28 years of conductorship.
Now he was adopted in retirement at 65 years of age.
The drinking water combination of the Vetenstein group with seat in Kottendorf, the municipality Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters annually and provides 32 places and villages with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Members are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was set up in 1985 as a water guard and has been appointed as the manager of the purpose association since 1988.
"Their tasks have been very diverse and have been extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.
As an outstanding event, she called the establishment and dedication of the new sources (1994), the purchase of land in the field of new fountains (1998) and the remuneration of farmers, the renewal of high vessels (1999), the renewal of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stopping and you have repeatedly taken up innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised guilts faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived the water purpose association regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Vitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district under francs.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who worked 28 years with him.
He's the best water waiting and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an inevitable team.
As highlights from his viewpoint, he referred to the fountain construction and restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were, however, the broken tube on the high container at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work through so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn has been maintained only once because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stormer from Lauter, who joins the follow-up of Rupert Göller.
Sopranistin Anna Netrebko is open to the Autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago had come well forward and now learned privately in New York, where the best therapists were.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is two years back when I sang to the Mailander Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots on partner
A 35-year-old man shot on Friday at 10:45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on his partner and hurt her deadly.
"The man called himself to us and indicated to have shot his partner," said a police speaker.
The acter is on the escape, after him is held publicly.
Meanwhile, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 metres large, muscular, brown and has a glazing.
In the meantime, the police published a picture of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a glat.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S., they're supposed to call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was the year 1988, the deeder 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not initially want to make any information about tathergang or the relationship between actors and victims; however, she confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a killing debt."
"More we don't say at present," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special input command (SEK) was on the site.
Steel - Light View for German steel industry
The German steel industry's crises and energy-intensive steel industry remains from additional costs to millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from the ecospace support are from the table.
It remains in liberation of the renewable energy environment in the stock facilities for the so-called self-stream production in the German steel industry, Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) said the "West-Deutsch Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that we could finally achieve this negotiations after two years."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask steel producers to use gases from the high oven for the production of electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs from EUR 120 to EUR 240 million per year, according to the German Branch Association.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in steel works, an EEC environment of 20 percent falls.
But these are not also raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
The status Quo of the existing scheme is largely determined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"In terms of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More have to follow."
"Even in the reform of the emission rights trade, climate and employment targets are to be considered," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation was further worsened as the world's largest producer country China was thrown into the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand for mass steel.
European producers provide Chinese steel groups for price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed a little.
Firstly, import duties on import duties have been due to effect, and secondly, the economic prospects in China have been raised.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrapp stayed careful on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have been stable again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not last want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were busy at the end of 2015.
In July the German steel producers remain careful despite increasing prices and orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tons of almost six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the economic association of steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by two percent.
In the coming months, the association is calculated thanks to an improved contracting team with a rising outlet.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing Adolescents do well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching office study, she was in the field of music, and today the 78-year-olds sing in a senior choir.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, joyful and totally more alive, she says.
In addition, she is doing something good with her health and her spirit.
Because from several perspectives, Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with equals the joy of music, describes Hackler.
By regular convergence, seniors can cultivate and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are dissolving in the age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Take up and organize, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of consensus."
Sing can be difficult in a positive sense, says Hackler.
For seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Whoever regularly demands his lungs, even in the daily life, does not run out of the breath.
Even if it's about maintaining the sound of the voice in the age, Sing is an optimal hobby.
For elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Song texts and especially melodies distinguish themselves from those who suffer from illnesses.
At singing, a special performance is also requested to the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrate at the same time on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a major cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that is gained by singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-value feeling also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I exercise for a long time, I get better and grown beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing, there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You're not singing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes on?
At the search for the appropriate offer, the seniors have different options, says Hackler.
Sing someone from the familiar circle in a senior chore, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the Chöre in the area.
Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the municipality or the chief of the church.
Many senior careers can also be found via the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help at the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, Hackler advises.
Sing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to the crying of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats babys on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mauage also did not make the males cold - but they always did the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement rate of cats babys at the miau of the little ones.
They react about ten percent faster to the sounds of cats, which are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have discovered.
Catherine also responds to the call of cats - but always the same.
"Of course, the acoustic differences between the miau of minor and strongly educated young animals for the males are either unobservable or unimportant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the researcher team had already found that the duration and height of the chains are different from the urgency of their need for assistance.
Overall, nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the preservation of the MHH.
They were pre-played for a call from young people who were taken out of the garbage box for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were confronted with crying by stronger chains, which were also raised.
The researchers consider their results to be significant despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own success, responded differently to the crying," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the very more arrogant cats.
This ability may be inborn or develop with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males responded at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grabs "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football camping in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest order has been adopted against the entranced football star Hakan Sükür.
He is proclaimed to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the patch attempt, there is an important football game in Turkey.
Before the duell of the arch rivals between BeVisas Istanbul and Luke Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual" is stated.
In the event of an admissibility of the exceptional state after the crash attempt in July, the government did not defend the dailyity of normal citizens.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fetholah Goldens, who are responsible for the punishment attempt.
It is also not held before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Saukür, the state prosecutor declared a arrest order.
Accordingly, the surgeon living in America is now proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sucuur is supposed to be the follower of the preacher Fetholah Gülen, who is made responsible for the punishment attempt by President Recep Tayip Erdogan.
Although the initial exception status for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually affects the life of most Turks, but as well as no effect.
The nightly "democratic Wake" on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan ended on Wednesday.
Sports is divided into trailers and opponents of Erdogan, just like the whole country.
Especially fans of the worker club Besichtas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
But what the larger of the Turks in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military bushs.
Even the fans agree - regardless of whether their heart struggles for Galatasaray or Bevisas.
In the case of Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come to Luke Podolski again.
His sports value proved at the end of the season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 winner.
The newspaper "Fanatic" admired him, "He was the best in place."
He finished the season in excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a reconciliable conclusion for the record champion.
After the pre-running K.o in the Champions League, the "leaves" also divorced early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only rich in rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"We've done this and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
The game year was better for Master BeVisas.
Especially thanks Mario Gomez, who, with 26 season meetings, put the base on the 14th title as the Super-Lig-Torschützen King.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this respect, the Gomez, who was contracted at the AC Florence, and was borrowed to BeVisas, had only announced after the punishment attempt to not return after his EM leave because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Ficret Orman.
But to this end, the storm would have to be ready to avoid about one third of its estimated annual salaries of 7,5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary in Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have Medal Chans at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted lightathletics singers can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic Doping still determines the strikes in the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimming girl Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping locker, had complained about her right to start the games, was excavated and excavated at her start (100 metres breast).
It offered a scenario: She was still proud in the hall with a pleasant smile and provoked with her appearance.
When she found that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilee storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite the Doping past, start with the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's a summary:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already locked two times for Dopings (2001 and 2006 until 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex World Champion even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered as the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-fold Olympia Girl and seven-fold world champion had to take a six-month lock after she had been proved to take the pain medicine Oxycodon.
After surgery, she had strong dental pain, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatien): In 2011, the Olympic Champion of 2012, World Championship of 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the prohibited stimulans means of methylhexanamine.
Perkovic took the knowledgeful intake and was locked six months.
The four largest rolls this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): Beijing Olympia and two times world champion over 400 m, was positively tested and 21 months was locked in 2010.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible for Merrit.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Nearly one athlete has been known so many medals afterwards.
So Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after his testosteron doping was found.
In addition, the 40-year-old had to surrender Olympia silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 for testosterone misuse.
The well-known bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 received him back on the basis of a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
With 80,04 m, he is on rank two of the world's order list.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world recorder and Gold Favoritin were tested positively only in May, but still may start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found indications of the intake of a forbidden food supplement, the locking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and went off on 13 July.
Bomber in Thailand - Austrian injured - More Dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but has already been able to leave this again.
Her home trip planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the Phuket island and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, they are still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, was first exploded in two bombs on Thursday night in an outdoor quarter.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and some 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, then two plenty points were raised again, according to the authorities, another man was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
At the detonation near the popular Patong bathing beach, a taxi driver was injured according to police statements.
In Surat Thani at the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities in a flower bed before the district of the coastal police, the explosion rate was in the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the southwest coast and in Chumphon at the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
You're going out of a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The Bombenattentats carry the same handwriting," said Armeeegeneral Danai Critmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself on possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.
In the attacks, Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the Bombenattentat Muslim Separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attacks are not related to the Islamic Resurrection Movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opposers of the dominant military junta.
In the past days, the authorities had received secret service indications of emerging attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police advised their officials throughout the country, strengthening the security around important government buildings, as well as airports, railways, tourist attractions, restaurants and pleasure districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombing attacks, but they usually do not address tourists.
In Hua Hin, a palace was used over years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the modern bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High safety risk (security level 3) was valid for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
Following conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travels to these provinces are advised.
Increased safety risks (security level 2) amounted to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody disruption, holds itself to benefit from bringing the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Nearly a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "identitary movement" has been shown by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several countries, the Constitutional Prosecutors in the Federal Federation have also monitored the group.
"We see in the 'identitary movement' points of point for endeavours against the freedom of democratic rule," said Constitutional Protection Manager Hans-Georg Maßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamed in extremist ways.
That is why we are watching the movement.
The "identitary movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multicultural Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of its own identity by override".
Constitutional protector in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Thüringen - already observe the "identitaires".
It must be said that his authority has voted closely with the national departments in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Manager.
Generally, extremists try to talk to them with youth-right language, often with poppy music.
That did Islamists as well as legal extremists.
This is not a fantastic advertising for your own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to call the people emotionally.
Young people are in a special way offended.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there had been reports from several federal countries on contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Must say that he has no knowledge of it.
For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It concerns whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target and becomes so extremist by certain extremists.
It is therefore essential whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is unrecognable.
In view of the significant increase in legally justified crimes and attacks on asylum candidates and refugees, Maßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years, we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Volunteer group.
It may be that further legal terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legally extreme motives.
However, a German country-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The current groups have been created at regional level or in social networks.
It was a matter of concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the alarm.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or adherers to the right scene.
"So many people have committed criminal offences that had previously had nothing to hate with legal extremists who might have been politically different or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or left, which have radicalized themselves through the right-extremistic mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the matching lines in the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures at a time.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte then became a viral Internet hit.
Actually, the 24-year-old with a remainder of 48 seconds ended its precedence and occupied the 59th place of 59 launchers.
However, it was rather his not just sports figure that raised the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in subrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethopia, Hatte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "whale of the whale".
The English boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" was funny about him.
His time, he only attacked with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, wasn't mattering.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
In the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani’s course gave media attention.
It was unforgettable that the swimmer appeared from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter in a predecessor of over 100 metres of free style alone.
Moussambani was then fired.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the new place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsreder had left her business on Monday at 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window at the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about EUR 250 was disappeared from the box.
The tracks of the acter could not be found.
A video monitoring is also not available.
Trump does not see the threatening electoral situation so tight
The republikan presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
If it doesn't happen with the choice to the US president, Donald Trump has already an alternative idea.
He's just going to the vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively careful for him: "Lastly it will work either, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republican in a telephone interview with the U.S. television CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end because of political correction, it's all right, Trump said.
Thus he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State Terror Military (IS).
Within his party, resistance was finally growing.
Post increases in trade with electrical transporters
An electrical shipping vehicle of the German post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is evident.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter too.
In a short time, the group wants to start trade with the carrier.
The post wants to offer their electrical transporters on the free car market from the coming year.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has checked whether it is intended to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with letters and packages, to other companies.
Jürgen Gerdes had said that it was always demanding again, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "The Mirror", the Bonder Group is about to get into the mass production of vehicles.
In the post-own manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10.000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wants to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and to peil a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles for the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're turning the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany since 2014.
GfK leadership declines after disappointing business numbers
The Consumer Research Company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The receptions came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the GfK market research company made it clear that the chair of director Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the success he promised.
Turbulences at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After reassuring business numbers and the return of company management, the world number Five of the industry is beginning to start a personal new.
The GfK Board of Directors will leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the GfK Arno Mahlert is already dismissed from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
The leadership in the board already took over the previous board member of Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September.
He should officially take over the function of a "president" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy.
Details did not want to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles, on Friday, the shareholders were most disappointed about the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business numbers, each shareholder becomes unhappy at any time.
"If this was the case with BMW, that would also do the Quandts like that," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 after return in the pre-quarters.
With 361.2 million euros, the turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable previous year quartal.
As regards the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter has, above all, undermined the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company depreciations of 139 million euros needed in the Consumer Experience business sector have made a loss of 148.2 million euros to the group.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had gained a group of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus runs out in crumbhorns in graves: Eight Injured
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 elderly passengers, eight people have been injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travelling company from Eisenach had to evacuate its information from a truck that was partly travelling on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and shot into a grave, as a speaker of the Aurich/Wittmund police report.
"Due to the situation of the bus, the people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firearm released the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a physician came to the accident site on the country road 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Crummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travelling company.
The investigators urged the driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are 3.44 for the area of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl as far as 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lendenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (EUR 2.26) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (EUR 2.18).
In the case of the installation in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overwhelming calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
Citizen Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that when the budget was approved by the Kulmbach country council, there were coverages for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-dependent manner on legal basis.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as business and industrial companies from Welchenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take the money bag deeper.
The fees increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under covers were also compensated for from the previous calculation period.
The grave fees raised Schmidt justifies the fact that all three wastewater plants deal with relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater seizure, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenditure on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact.
In addition, the wastewater rise in all three plants is slightly declined.
In addition, during the downward calculation period, all three plants were not at a significant level due to their age of renewal and repair costs.
The installation in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the installations for Welchenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater plant Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage.
In the pump coal, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be overloaded from the ground and Lopp had to be used in the dairy cliffing plant after nearly 20 years of operation of the first clerk, to remove the clergy lamb and to install an additional ventilation option in order to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these exceptional expenses, the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs which should be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the low wastewater attack in the three installations, the costs for operation and maintenance are "full".
In addition to Schmidt, the market community remained disposed of large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants is to continue to be pre-careous in the view of stone houses in the long term, since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended to these plants because it is deficitary facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (from June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, as positive 0.2% has been booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that already limits to the absurd.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Lightenstein.
The filters are unbloomed, property-drifting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past criticized them in which they were accused that the app blackface would promote or white skin as beautysideal.
When this week some users suggested a filter that was made up to them, false teeth and dim wings, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbsicht".
They wondered whether these repeated conflicts pointed out a major problem that the company has a diversity.
The news and admonition were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was thought as a hommage of Anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced the razzia, the filter reminded of hurtful climbs.
Others definitely rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Savepani, a Korean-American art student, whose Tweet was widely distributed about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and softly said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contrast of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-viewed, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stroke.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in the hand.
And the big audience of young people - which are different from their older counterparties - could rather assume to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters generates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In a record for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversials reflect a lack of diversity in the professional practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the large part of the white, only male leadership and ended its order with a Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They either have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their employees, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours working there, but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say what to do."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has mostly left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its employees and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently set up a staff manager focusing on subrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said herself that she would be able to close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she needed more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military management counterfeit ISIS Secret Service Information, establishes the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed informal information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria if it had allowed the actual conditions on site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a Task Force of the republikan members of the Army Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Army Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analysis, who reported how managers changed their estimates of American efforts to fight the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News Service Information, which was typically nicked by high-level Centcom Commanders, regularly made a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions in place and were more positive than other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the Representative House.
The management errors in the Centcom reach the top of the organisation.
The 10-page report shows in detail constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government peaks have been given under Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analyzers were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"By the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report stated.
For example, a Centcom publicly announced that a military recovery of Mossul could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, republikan congress member of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the report on the postal services to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played in that analyzers were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are in progress by the General Inspector of the Defence Ministry.
Democratic members of the News Services Committee published their own findings on Thursday, conforming to some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of instructive assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the Committee, member of the representative house Adam B. Ship.
This process, says Mr. ship, "was delayed in the publication of reports of defense", damaged morality among analysts, and "was excessively little space for different opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats argued that they had not found any hints about the intervention of the White House with the Centcom Analysts regarding a "definite political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress surveys were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were taken into account by Centcom Analysts' complaints.
Mr Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the congress reports while the investigations of the Inspector were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "Experts sometimes have very different opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Defence Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defence."
The investigations have retrospective effects on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry).
The accusations last year, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest appreciation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state recalls twisteds of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small crew in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in rebelling against the current report on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government authorities, the team around Mr Hooker notes that against the government's statements, air hits against the raffinadery held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the Terrorist group, since these provisional raffinadery had been in operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the battle at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is before
One day after she shot three gates over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually be a remarkable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember that they ever did.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
She knows that, however, the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the first place in their group with the British women who remain unbelieved against Japan after their 2-0 victory.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinal, the game will decide which of the two within their group will gain the first and second place from six teams each.
The first placed one will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer from the way that leads the other group.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the American girls have triggered a surprising whirlpool, four years after landing at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey fighter in hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympia in 2008 because she could not qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012, in which she and her team all went wrong.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach of the National Team, began to turn things to better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work pension in London that we have now.
We've been able to scratch the rope completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torrey in the first half of the game with a back-hand tip from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly thorough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the gate to provide a 2-0 leadership to the American girls.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the gatekeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book each gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolin
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a rage of stack between competition and strive.
It's like the Olympic Fackel itself is a burning stack that is given from the armbrust protector to the swimmer to the tower to the triathlet.
You can't activate the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is with the Olympic Games for the first time and a woman's sword with grews, could have been under these known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-feel TV recruitment if he were a swimmer, tower or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, struggles around gold in the Olympic Trampolin towers.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate each event equally.
Continue from the centre, partly in the shadow, the sports types that are not generally recognized: Air guns shoots, bow shoots, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may rule it for a long time.
But if I should modestly argue for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discrete charm of the trampolin.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had his debut in Sydney, it has been noticed so sparsely over the past 16 years that many of those I had asked did not know that it is at all an Olympia sport.
This could also be regional ignore.
Although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolin jumping and had an athlete that has done it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampolin jumping has a certain outdoor charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not a expert, but just a earthly enthusiast.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartonous citats of his never want to end up in any way - but also the grass of the tower and diving, the two sports types that unite it essentially.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "spread board."
Splendid victory jumps on a giant trampolin, shoots up to 30 feet in the air and needs a series of falling movements (wheels, hills and salts) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to official Olympia Program after execution, difficulty and "fly time".
Two-two-third athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will intervene in Rio.
The common Olympic vector is straightforward.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down at the playground.
They are not only hunting the target line or the starting wall, but in the television transmission, they are also a different hilly target: the world or the Olympia record.
The targeted pursuit is nobel, admiring, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel as tired when I look at these games myself.
Of this, the trampolin offers an atempause.
The vector of the trampolin jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she cracks off, seemingly hard like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then suddenly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is like the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and degradations will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will eliminate as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia way, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the approach and objection of male athletes - as the male US tourners recently suggested by The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new catching to air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. bonder
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who demand political changes in Ethiopia have found violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that twenty protestants were killed during the collapse with the police at shot change.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the past ten years, it was one of the stablest countries of Africa, a solid West Association with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have been shaken, and they have eliminated more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was incredibly merciful.
Witnesses indicated that police were shooting and killing at twenty unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The Head of the UN Human Rights Administrative Board now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most popular country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist dangers beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded in a considerable tempo.
Its infrastructure has improved drasticly - there is a new pendler train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was nothing but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the wound grip in relation to the power of the governing coalition.
After a largely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this tough, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could use and rearm turbulences.
Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of the pre-heaven under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
In recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly frequent and improved Internet services.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they were gathered to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eonen, the Amharas, mostly coming from Ethopia’s Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's about to change.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who represent about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the trouble is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death at an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analytics say that he was particularly disturbed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them injurious.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more blood pouring.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which, according to the information of analytics, seemed to have been poured and stolen by the government.
During the following races, many protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disruption went relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, as well as for their measureable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disadvantage of the Ethiopian government.
And she adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharic city, by Tigray, and the hatred against the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. Government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin wandering."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS had been "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to distinguish the last controversials that surrounded his campaign by saying that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously meant by the "Grunders" of the Islamic State Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions about the ability to communicate the presidential candidates of the Republicans, whether it could be clear and understandable to communicate with the American public.
It also brings his contradictors who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the own position to explain statements that he couldn't have meant.
After making the breath of a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and stated in interviews that he really did not suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarkastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate would not know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism is falling down to Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on falling survey values to the economic situation.
Mr Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He reported on Twitter warned that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boringly.
Mr Trump has already put Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant it sarkastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the linguistic boundaries into politics and then rudge back as necessary.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" depending on how the reaction comes out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vacuum enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of discerning the sound of the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted a more ambiguous tone, as its survey values have continued to decrease.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great lead in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally does not have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention of the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trump's joke has brought his loyal fellow strugglers into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provokant his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps' most prominent speakers, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr Giuliani, he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he named her rear bankers, perfectly false, and so it happened because he took the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream republics are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by leaving the situation aggressively under control in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and asked them to ride around every one of his words and to be premature against him.
He shocked the "arm, punishable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the President's office.
Once expelled over the price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Coffee was a narrow café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were expelled.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Indigenous people grieved it as the last loss in a gentricating city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's changing, it's also new invention.
A released verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one miles north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar light atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year employee of the old café, who is owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to make funds for a new outside, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for Bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food map, sandwiches with spectacles and cheese and there are yarns such as caps and cleaned thiefs.
There are natural rice scooters.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh soaps for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady electricity of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also expelled by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that liked me," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered another new addition on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffees a blending Chai Tea.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work, and indefinitely ordered the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagle with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his ordinary order, but sometimes he switches his Everything ball with Speck, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't wrestle that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-born coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we'll go to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to postpone them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-born coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a studio and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry of the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicate foods of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie grass and Maryland waterschildrötensuppe.
His menu this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puré and as a desert a pflaum pudding.
"It was a act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while bricksman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A good meal" that will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publishing, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, narrowless imbis in the Flatiron District, which is already in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, crude tooth with potato purée and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbrate, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about food in the era of great depression.
"Richhaltige foods were very popular," said bricksman.
There was earthnut bread, liver cheese and bone bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many earthnuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinst.
"It must have been lying in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was a all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Women's teams bought for male field workers and it was served freshly backed pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways that the country was dealing with to be no longer the slurpe country.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, excited topic," coe announced why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was excited: secret foods such as bread and box rolls were found in basic nutrition, the cake role as "wonderful kind of food restoration," noted the bricksman, since cookers could hide unapetitive ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Individual mixtures were tested, as a caloria rich and nutrient satisfaction was prior to taste or even healthy cuisine.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, the tileman prepared a court from this Epoch, backed thicknesses with earthnuts butter.
"It was not a popular addition to lunch," said Coe.
"It was surreal."
Earthnuts butter and backed thiefs do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household economic receptions.
Like never before or since, household operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - had so much to do with the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "Hospital policymakers" and to meet the challenge of transforming pamps like cream spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical beats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungering citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was eating like the millions of hard man from the world to which he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with grain sauce," said Coe.
He ate in a almost golden food room and had a smoking.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a householder with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortable preparations."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
The fortune is on our continued focus on calories and food, said bricksman, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple gave when writing the book to have better understanded the eating habits of the tileman's mother - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"You had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.
Tegelman remembered, "It actually made people sick."
There was the wind bag case.
After the plates were removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a desert that they had prepared at home: the plumbing seat, President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said the brickman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a smart name.
There was no hitch, only plumes, some meal, sugar, water and Zimt.
Everyone rejected a leap into the tiny, brown slabber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a look three times.
Like a Can-Do Budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
Killed at bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save the life of others.
Now the 30-year-old even died at a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, who, according to image time, has saved almost 60.000 people to life.
2900 volunteers play their own lives to draw people from Bombed Houses and to provide first help in the war area.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protector, which shows him in a 11-hour salvation of a baby from the tribes of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a lighting symbol in the gray of war.
As heroes, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture, "For me this is the true Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell a attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four fashion bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorogas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now eliminate the poisonous remnants of the bomb so that they don't play children with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest rebel animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the northern Atlantic with a total of 1 km/h - until today.
Grönlandhaie only gets up with 150 years of age.
The Grönlandhai swims generally along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he reaches just 1,220 meters in average.
Only when it comes to it, the five meters long animal accelerates 2.6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robe.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent approach for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the "Science" magazine, at least, of a greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that greenland hai will be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland hails are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the Eismer before the thin populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland Hai.
Their time lupe speed measured when they provided six animals with a transmitter in front of the spike mountains.
Yet, these hails make: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the bones of a young ice cream.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrols on the ground of the eismer and are looking for cadaver, which are torqued down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland Haie, which took fishermen from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as an advancing from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the core of the shark with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens emerges before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had incredibly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts swallowed larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centuries, the lenses core contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from nuclear weapon trials, it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 during his investigation.
However, all larger greenland hails had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lenses, which are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-hour showed a age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long greenland hai, while the record-hai with 502 centuries is expected to be even 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai females were only known when they were longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age.
Since one of the 392 centuries of the animals was probably at the threshold of gender maturity and his age was 156 years old, green hay is apparently allowed to be at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methusalme live in ice waters is not an accident.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in whose spectacle was placed on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon peak, was caught before Alaska.
Due to low temperatures, the organisms of the animals living there are often running on sparflames.
So they grow up later - and older.
To keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal blows warmth.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So, a small animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolution biologist scourge.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the municipality council has discussed issues about construction.
With the facilitation of the body, the communication by Mayor Robert Putz said that "the sale of the newly explored residential areas can finally begin".
Following the clarification of the ground, parceling and locking questions and the requests for measurement, the sale of the property in the residential areas "Strasslweg" and "Schönau-West" (Rike Binderstraße - Building Section 1) is no longer in the way to stakeholders.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the country-wide and quiet residential community are similar to young families and rusty seniors.
As it was said, construction will be able to report immediately at the Council's house, about the award of the parcels, the municipality Council is expected to consult at its September session.
In order also to comply with requests for the establishment of further businesses, in conjunction with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the re-establishment plan set out in the spring of this year in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of undertimelarn, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards the State Road 2112.
Frankfurt profits from Brexit
Thus, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city am Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether funding houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have yet sufficient authorisation in Britain.
It's just using large US banks.
Several banks have already announced to transfer jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The close to the Notenbank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtland.
Luxembourg has a large funding industry, but as do Dublin, it is more difficult to cut away from infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city points with easy-to-use commercial immobilities.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtland.
In addition, the hires for first-class industry are 50 per cent higher than the main.
In addition, Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of company advice Mercer, the city is on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although life quality is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial place for the European Internal Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW follows.
However, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit-Votum, economic researchers believe.
This also means the power conditions: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, about 144000 people in the banking industry, it was 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatic C Patentstreit with Merck
A U.S. lawyer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to refund the legal costs that have arisen from the Hepatic C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a damage payment of $200 million for the injury of two patents from Merck, which were related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior of Mercks, including myides and other unethical actions.
When the complaint was raised on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to fix the costs arising during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to draw along with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained and owned each other for laboratory work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
Armies supported by the United States say that they have again recovered full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
Armies supported by the United States have recovered complete control over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left them, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through the city at the moment after the excursion of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held as hostiles by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish shared the Manbi Military Council Reuter, which was bound to the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just pursuing cleaning," he said Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which gave a income of $10.75 million for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and a effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons spended USD 1 million for pleasant purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton acquired almost USD 5.3 million in speakers; the former foreign minister gave a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Foreign Ministry.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, publishes together with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a crushing contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false explanations and withdrawals regarding his promises to publish his tax statements.
It is usual for US presidency candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax assessment by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," Clinton's electoral officer Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, as regards the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests are not completed.
Trumps critics, including the republikan presidency candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it acceptable that his refusal raises issues regarding assets, its donations for well-acting organisations, its business signs and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranging Republican Trump invites to publish his tax statement.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a discussion on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements." she said about the amount.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump did not pay taxes or only very few taxes, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who claimed that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the electoral campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionary and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industry conglomerate has its seat here to take a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he was also undergoing a tax assessment of the IRS and Trump was "angry" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations depending on 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined rate of approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that this only amounted to USD 100 of its income as a wage, different from the majority of all Americans.
Their main funding was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzanias Elefant Protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox manner to prevent elephants from going into people's residents - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved itself effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, who had the idea of this already years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, using a violent four-level method for protecting their houses and harvests without injuring animals.
Previously, many spices have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we developed this ... Toolkit, we could see a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fackel and the bubble in a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition.
When it is ignited, the condom puts up with a knall and sprays fine dust on chilipuders in the air.
A cock usually already out to chase the elephant.
A last possibility represents a shop that shoots a golden rain fire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The City Council decides unanimously: No Kiosk-new construction at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer investment projects of traders with coss hand are considered to be clearly expandable in the core city.
However, the request for a reconstruction of a sales ciosk at the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony in the construction was now unanimously rejected by the City Council.
"In principle we welcome new commercial operators, but at this location in exposed location at the Rheinufer does not fit this kiosk," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU fraction.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arabian" call - RT News
A French ruler with Jewish roots released a media restoration after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list a Israeli pre-selection, as it was an Arabian guest, according to a employee, "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center.
The director was looking for an explanation to turn to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there shocked him, as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure is a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it, more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were disturbed and disturbed by this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even an even greater shame.
That doesn't require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the Internet, where people named it a scandal.
Some subscribed to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "rejected the claimed requests of Arab guests".
"Beautiful," it said in another contribution, where it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the accusations and called the incident a "decause" and "apologize" at Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not include in the Quick Choice List," the South German newspaper quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
Police uses tear gas & rubber fires against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber fires against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began as a police officer trying to dismiss the students, which led to the use of rubber shoes and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the suggestions of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300 000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen to spray graffitits against the preliminary President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dilma Rousseff, who had been withdrawn by a Senate's voting to her office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the suspension of the penalties, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70,9 per cent in the annual comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the sides of Russian companies in businesses in the country became strong, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies take up existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to provide access to the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased with 91.5 percent incredibly and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The trade rise was achieved by supplying machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued about 35.000 Visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year, " he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd who have received monumentes of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses seeking: Drinking market in forest brown
A robbery attack has been carried out on Thursday night on the drinking market of Rewe XXL at the Gerberstraße forest brushes.
Under the preservation of a shooting gun, three dark clothes, who had mumled their faces, demanded the output of cash from the drinking market and then fled first to foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW-golf.
How much money was used, the police don't share.
The actors should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres large, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly from the park cover of the Rewe market from accessible and badly visible.
After the attack on Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the actors must have been driven from the car parking parking lot with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (slider ring).
Those who have made observations in connection with the robbery at the time (at 19:45 p.m.) should be urgently reported to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and adolescents spent the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the Nagold Child Protection Association with their maintainers on their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühleacker.
In the quiet recreational home Hardtwaldle, the life-friend group was registered during the first week of school holidays.
Several wholeday trips were on the program.
First of all, it went to boards with the visit of the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, after Moulbronn, where there was a special child leadership in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
In the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep-sea in Maulbronn, who invited to jump, swim and plants.
Kulinarically, children and maintainers with their self-prepared body foods, such as the Sauren Spätzle, the seabronner Pfannle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, a spacious, beautiful jewelry was made from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman moth game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby dawn, the evenings at the fire and the final "bunte evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun and the children and young people came to the home.
Haigerhole: Pilgers for the pforte of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrim migration from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were jointly managed.
In order to overcome the time until the next spaceway of all ministers in expected two years, St. Anna’s Oberministerial Round decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrim.
Several Wallfahrt targets were examined and finally decided for the Bishops City Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercience, was offered a special pilgrim target with the palace of mercy at the Friburger Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerhole and Holy Rooms were on the way.
In the evening before, priest Storost sent out the Pilgers in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilger Cross and gave the Pilger's egg.
From Horb was driven by train at the start point Villingen, where also a mast of Our Dear Woman stands and thus the Pilgerweg was joined by the Münster.
In the morning and evening, each day tour was embraced by a short impulse with various prayers, songs, and scriptures.
But also on the way, the Minis made roasts of field crosses, chapels or churches all the time to sing together a song of a specially compiled Pilger Liedheft.
For the nights each of the parishes of the local priesthoods were available.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a delicious and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days afterward, the stage came to St. Peter, which was the most strangerous roadway, but at swollen heat, first had to go down about 500 meters of height and then be climbing again.
The earned reward was a common grill at the bathroom.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing clown circle of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually facilitated and happy, the Minis met at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and went through the palaces of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilger target was welcomed.
After God’s service, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sakrist and the High Altar.
The next day was still time for the breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite calls gold for bicycle sports
Scotland Callum Skinner was in a man team sprint last night in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old of Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The boy pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to house a victory of the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympics.
They repeated the trick after in March they took only a modest sixth place at the railway world champions in London, despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hind.
Hoys retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now become unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympia record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealand countries seized in the first round.
And the British Trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was nearly back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made a large part of the transformation, at the slope in a higher walk, to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the speed.
Hoy looked out from his position as BBC experts and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a smooth comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympia record in the end and defeated the world championships.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the Triumph 2012 on Kennys and Hoys page, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he would deliberately fall on the train.
He pulled this statement back later and there was no objection from England's rival.
At such an excellent victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We got so bad away with so many world titles that it was amazing to win back at the Olympia.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the field of possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic Gold Medal in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one from Hoy.
Kenny is next to the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be struck as a ridder."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull graduated with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The world record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be securely focused.
He had struggled with officers before qualification yesterday when he called functionaries to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong track wheel team to dominate the mean period of the Olympic Games and get a scar of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were declined.
Dramas played in the background, so the withdrawal of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April, in the middle of sexism and mobbing claims, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it seems like the now legendary call of GBs that reached its highlight at the perfect moment could be repeated.
The future of the melting of Portland due to the suspension of the energy contract
The future of the aluminum melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thus lift all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A subsidy defined for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened by closing.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as melting is consuming about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Meltingry, which led to an closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland loses money and risks a close.
This step follows the years' speculations regarding the future of the investment, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminum melting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will cancel their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority possession of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the installation will continue to be operated in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through melting," the company informed.
AGL continued to claim that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period of cancellation, so that they will end in 2017.
"From this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong markets for wholesale flow prices.
AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual settlement of $ 187 million in "awaiting a cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, "capacity to operate alcoas... melting or to ensure electricity supply to melting" does not impede.
The U.S. Company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of the portland meltery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
The head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland would use about 600 Megawatt and Tomago about 900 megawatts each year.
If both plants were disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [stream market].
And for us as a power producer, this wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the trademark messenger of Estee Lauder and run on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to cry," wrote Kendall.
The discovery of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of problems Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classical turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-contained action nearly every birthday season of a child mission (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a sign-trick rabbit on a posting site at 8 p.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes her to have hit the Vogue cover (her and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With an extent that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertising operators (as Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages of advertising).
The discovery of his coverstar is so desirable that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still incurred before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, obviously more "respects, the models" than "Models that are famous" were on the cover.
Oscar prizemaker and dior trader Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the small chance that Mrs Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "throughbreak model" of her generation - falls within the previous category, she is in good society.
These familiarities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of them apply to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little excited.
In June, the only Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the stupids of the moment."
These feelings bought up again when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be over the point of disrespect.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she's seen in the reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Public law centres resign 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most need for assistance are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is taking into account the impact of further funding shortenings on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five persons - most older people, immigrants, help-needed workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust declaration and similar - are already rejected in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exhausted, are ready for further reductions.
From June next year, it is provided that these legal centres will lose 30 per cent of their federal funds.
The director of the Centrums of Community law of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Right Centres showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that without abolition of the Federal Government's decision, the situation would only be worse.
"Queensland community law centres are chronicly underfined, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with untransparent and depressing debts, families that go through separation, workers who have been unlawfully released - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of help-needing people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the lawyer-general and federal justice minister, as well as the senators of Queensland George Brandis to cancel these funding abbreviations immediately, so that the people they need can receive the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the country government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities and that the government invests Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees claimed to drag a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of claimed inactivity after you were informed that their campaign leader for North Carolina in February directed a shooting gun to a employee while in February they were traveling in a Jeep.
The incident is described in a complaint submitted on Wednesday in the court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programming officer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right point finger on the departure, and hit the race in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his accusation.
After complaining on the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already experienced Phillip, he stated in the accusation.
"Waps don't have to be fired to damage," Bordini indicated.
The accusation comes only two days after the republikan presidency candidate triggered a restoration when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Change People" - shotgun owners and gun-friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had broken his words out of the context and that he wouldn't strike to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage replacement from the campaign for injury of the obligation of care and of Philip for injury and persistent seal damage.
Trumps Press Speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer employee of the campaign.
On calls to his consultant, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responded.
The republikan presidential candidate Donald Trump has hitherto led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Swerin: Country Valent Survey: Lose SPD and CDU
In the next elections in the Federal States Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are considerable losses for the government partners SPD and CDU.
This showed representative surveys of the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could hardly continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to set the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, was just closely before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is violated between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previous 18,4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time on the country day.
Despite light losses, the green ones rehearse with 6 percent (previous 8.7 percent) in the Swiss landday.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each on the country day.
In the Berlin parliamentary electoral election, the ESPD of the survey would be only 23 per cent (Wale 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens by 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left by 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the parliamentary house.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope that the pirates would fail to get back, in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time lupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers are dominating the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as a iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in storage was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the business just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone time of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "Büro in the West Bags Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for those standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the Communicator was to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be collapsed similarly as a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen was found.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could realize that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The mobile part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and developed.
Today the market is dominated by suppliers who all came a lot later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere be online, this is for very many people everyday.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million pieces.
The global turnover with the devices is around EUR 400 billion.
The well-running businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies are involved.
In the meantime, around the smartphone, a whole industry has been created.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came until early 2007, then Apple-Chef announced Steve Jobs the introduction of the iPhones on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communicationsman, to easily use everything by touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the checks.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-understanding 20 years after his invention.
Today, every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone off too once," just said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens board responsible for staff.
Permanent achievement is currently considered as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London.
For me, this represented the greatest attraction of Heathrows, as was then in London in 2012, when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympia brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10 000 new teachers, 40 000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement of Heathrows is too large.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The twoflers were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals a infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in the field of scientific growth, and to leave a fortune of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which was selected five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal until T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are willing to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow, and ensure our future trade and create a fortune of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" about display blocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to cope with advertising blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad-blocking on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog mail in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the codation regarding his advertisements in order to detect ad blockations the detection of what part of the site advertising is difficult to detect.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to cope with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-und-Her-kamp between the display-blocking open source community and the surroundings have been in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has been fighting is a strong indicative of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, approximately 200 million people use ad-blockers; almost four times so much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile final devices, mobile advertising comprises 84 percent of Facebook advertising.
The company has looked at advertising blockers on Desktop PCs, since mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large proportion of revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a reward.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update his "show preference tool" to have more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocks would be new filters of concern because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For the users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," an Facebook speaker informed in an email message.
Advertisement blockers are a stunning means, so we have focused on developers like Ad Preferences instead to put more control in the hands of people.
Woman on suspected suicide on Swiss Autobahn
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call up witnesses after a woman was travelled on a Thursday in the early hours of the morning at a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman placed on the street in the dark "in a act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is evident that a Swiss woman, aged 49, who had been driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died in the place.
Several drivers have already been learned, but some have not yet been identified, the police who invited them and every witness of the incident to report.
A investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains waiting for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collapse preventable?
This is something that the lawyer has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases during the last five years show that the drivers are not taken to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as stated in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was released from the violent killing after she had passed over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drowned and has become unconscious on the street, the court took place.
The court found that the police - who had answered an emergency call - went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was "a perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under point 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
The Venus was probably inhabitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density could once have identified similar conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from fast dilutation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of the Venus exposes its dayside of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun's heats.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth is today.
The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution, previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although she was probably inhabitable once, the Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogens disappeared, only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy goes back as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to a low code of participation in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coacher and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer I have long and much thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly coordinated to the organisation.
He must also have a co-decision right in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had rented Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution for the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him for the future only the best.
Roy was awarded the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winner of Jack Adams Award.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was struck in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the aftersaison in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference with five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers are re-conversing, determining Streik
Working struggles concerning the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all dispute parties put themselves on the table for a new round of discussion, the negotiator said.
Stricts against the Oil Field Service Provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next weeks, which will start the beginning of next year to reconcile the problems.
The trade unions said that their last stroke, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to a negative market pressure.
The company's rate reduction follows a 10-percent decrease for Unshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the room needed to get through the market drop.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to dismiss its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-conclusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower ro-help travel, a economic situation that had increased by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish parliamentary Member Dave Anderson met with worker leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.2 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star head of the Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the pledges.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the star hoops are rotating at different rates and in what connection the rotation periods are with planet development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star head of the Plejades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star hop, which generated about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
These ripening stars have large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognized star flecks - like sunflowers -.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of slow piroutes rotating than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the stars of the Plejades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stable qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star heads of the Plejades offer an anchor for theoretical models of stable rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot in front of us that we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and thus hang their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the Rotation Rates of Plejaden, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star goes away
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation notice, the 41-year-old professional will be carrying the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays the tricot of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-month all-star game member of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen as the most valuable player of the Liga, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, his signature under a 10-year contract declared 27 million US dollars.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will function as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the roaming hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already, 2009, the Superstar admitted to "ESPN" from 2001 to 2003 to have prohibited steroids.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 lots in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect of receiving power funds for years through an anti-agging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the locker was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I have played 20 years without break," said Rodriguez sophisticated at that time.
Even his departure days do not go noiseless.
While many baseball legs in their last games receive the big stage again, Rodriguez had often to sit on the bank.
"My job does not include a goodbye tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," Yankees Coach Joe Girardi ate.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actress, Cameron Diaz, and was pronounced the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, was sympathy shows of fans by the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the trailers sang at the 4-9 lower layer against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Joined: Due to a positive doping sample, Adrian Zielinski weighter from Poland may not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A shot athletin would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters of Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish Weight Elevator Adrian Zielinski, were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the critical light athletics contests come in time.
In Chen, the diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide have been demonstrated in the last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the Final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the past more than 50 m free style.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B test and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen full cooperation in the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
The first time in history is not the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the message about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went into the opensives.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this is "a unbelievable shock," she said the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the lightathletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism to the athletin.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgaren are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, about all weight gainers from the chronic doping-belasted nation should not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympiasier in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both defy the intake, but both may not start in the class until 94 kg.
Before the start of the lightathlets, the Danekowa case is a further severe struggle for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the start of the complete Russian team until one exception for systematic dopings, and the Leufernation Kenya also produces many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sports, the former crimes in China had also led to violent conflicts between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang hardly.
"Sun Yang pinked lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt in the French radio.
Sun was also in the centre of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping deceit," said this.
Sun had been tested positively on the Trimetazidine in 2014 in the Chinese masterships, but only a three-month lock had to be set.
Data clay: So perfide pressing hackers their ransom money
Depressed malware programmers are currently targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey by Malware Defense Specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies asked were at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with depresser software in the last 12 months.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already aimed at a Ransomware depression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the actors in order to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The actors specialize their expressor software according to the observations of malwarebytes looking at attacks in business networks.
If they succeed there, the potentially expressive solution is much higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a terrible rapid development of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the actors discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks took place in the past months of a terrible hurry.
Ransomware works after a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it is targeted to search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
Then the software presents the demands of the expressors.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency bitcoin.
However, where private users are playing the personal photo database, businesses are about sensitive customer data or project databases without the production.
As a result, the damage occurs when a ransomware attacks.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported losses of sales by Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of illnesses.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the actors in view of stopping in operation.
The hackers, on the other hand, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contacts with the depressors and come to the result: the actors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or decrypt in order to avoid example files.
And when individuals are redeemed after payments of few hundreds of euros, companies must deal hardly and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from ransomware depression, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski by the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A individual person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software builder to the actual expressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10.000 dollars.
"Included in delivery is a adapter tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The expressors then search for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logs into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and orders another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Of course, the criminals then order spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to protect Ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the actors are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erection, the actors are threatening with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still much higher than before.
In the future, the actors could also take completely new goals in the Internet of things on cereals.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the free scaling of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom.
If the actors then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the violentity of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V works smaller, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row and in the fund, it does not work close at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and act pleasant, only the cockpit top will fall down.
Multilateral than comparable vehicles are the HR-V at the vacuum.
There is not only a suitcase of 453 l available for high positions and 1026 l for folded back loans, but there are the "magic seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the back bank can be folded up like cinema, thus offering vacuum space from the ground to the deck 1.24 m.
The suitcase room can be well loaded, but the charge height of 650 mm is a bit higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotational ranges very powerfully.
However, he is supposed to do his work a little more loud.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is happy.
There is another engineering: a 1.5-l benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-rad drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But it's supposed to be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Note Brems Assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the trackhold assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "heavening objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic mark detection and threatens the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are below the armband loan and are therefore to achieve something inconsistent.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoliner from EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline does not lie: Sturz on a passenger bridge
A airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only possible in the case of hazards typical for air traffic, the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf argued (Act.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knee at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the Court.
The airline had to pay the man no compensation.
Disease: When pays the organizer
Disrupted holidayers will only receive money after their journey if the cause of the disease is no doubt available at the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests proved to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was sick of diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost the whole vacation in the room.
Their disease led the vacations back to a defective clothing facility that was supposed to have contaminated the sea water.
The family felt that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
The complainants did not succeed before the court.
Although the clothing was actually defective.
However, the organizer was learned only shortly before the complainants were dismissed.
He had to assume that the sea water was all right.
So he did not hurt his information obligations, so the judgment.
In particular, no contamination was found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by vaccination - is part of the general life risk.
Of 691 guests were only 38 sick.
De Maizière said that, according to the violence of refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The state must be convinced and determined to respond to terrorist dangers at the same time.
Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the actors with hatred and division.
This triumph we will not benefit the terrorist.
However, if criminals need to leave the country faster, this increases security and also strengthens the approving of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Federal Day election.
He also announced a further staff reinforcement of security forces, "in the medium four-digit scale for several years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment again.
Video monitoring is intended to improve and the law of arms is renewed in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons in the Internet is difficult.
The most recent deliberate obligation for doctors should be maintained in accordance with the words of the Maizières.
However, he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the doctorship, how the danger of citizens could be reduced, he said with a view to psychic disturbances.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans the use of covered investigators.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of Interior clearly spoke against actionism.
"It was an eagle for the sharp makers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the radio media group (Freitag).
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full circulation considers it to be a constitutional problem.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I reject the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses before court.
Green-Chefin Simone Peter proposed to the Minister that he would like to simulate with ever new anti-terror packages activity and actionability.
The left-party Bernd Riexinger said: "Float words and a strengthening of the right to stay bring people in this country no longer security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It is regularly based on the turning road - here a picture of November.
But this should be changed: the legal question should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are on the road on the surrounding road every evening when driving over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure of Weseler Straße extends the right-by-way track by 700 meters.
Car drivers can then enter directly from the Hammer road to the right.
The great advantage: Transport is split up early, which improves the overall flow on the frequent section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district represented Münster-West.
The trailer collapses the drivers, especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.
During the working day, the backstroke reaches the bridge beyond the Albersloher road and sometimes also beyond.
Reason is the needle eye on the B 51 short before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only directed in detail through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary tragedy to take up, in particular, heavy load traffic.
The duration of this engpass and the associated work-day duration cannot be said by the competent country holding.
However, you can expect years: because the bridge has an official remaining time until 2034.
For the extension of the legal excise question, the country's operation has consciously chosen the weaker time in school holidays because of disabled persons to be expected.
Traffic will be carried over on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site.
Intercultural trip: Culture offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the "The Invisible House".
The Verein Nima's and the boy theatre are now planning a music project.
Nima's Association allows youths with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class International" of the Forest School of Children's House has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the young theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the Association of Nima, 19 students from 11 to 15 years of age visited the scenario in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, has been aimed at visiting schools with welcome classes to cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most young people in the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speaks little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the young theatre Münster.
The Verein Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languageel, and the boy theatre will work together in the next playtime in a music theatre project.
From October to December, youths with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be able to visit professionally directed courses in the fields of song, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre game and theatral language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increase in refugee numbers, the association is computed with many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of star sniffs: Hope of Weather Improvement
The weather has made the star-snoppen-guckers in the southwest of Germany a strike in the night for Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rains to observe the sky spectrum, said the chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many star sniffs at heaven.
The starships are Perseidens, which belong to the fastest star sniffs with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Recreational night: Tips for sleep disorders
In the evening you wander around forever, at night you're awake for hours, and the morning's far before weaking is no longer thinking of sleep.
That's all but refreshing.
Yet you are with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent as not refreshing.
How are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there can be many causes for them, underlines Hans-Günter Weet, member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what you understand in the country below is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia, an in-and-through sleep disturbance.
Just sleeping feels many people insufficient or insufficient, says Jens wagon servant, member of the German Hospital Doctors Association with Practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter, organic, psychic or behavioral factors, but also medicines can be found.
Not rarely the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early wake up is most often in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are contingent on each other.
For example, if you have a band-shaped incident, you can be bad, you will wake up every two to three hours and may begin to crush everyday problems and cares, you will give an example of weed.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you have sleep disorders to the doctor?
If you are not sleeping well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week and are affected on the day, you should go to your doctor.
The disturbance can look quite different: you are defeated, tired, unasleeped, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, have abdominal fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
In order to ease sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.
As treatment options, behavior changes, cognitive behavior therapy or medicines - classical sleeping tablets are only in exceptional cases and not more than for two weeks.
Lowered sleeping medicines are hardly available in Germany, stressed Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact the home doctor in the case of sleep problems, wear.
It can explain with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping work, and what happens there?
For study in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in snakes with atemaus sets, in sick day tiredness, in sleeping converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Don't do lunch sleep," says Fietze.
After the cable you go to bed at his normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body, you carry a nosebrill, a chest guitar and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera records the sleeping on the deck.
How can affected people deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of stainless screws that you can use for a better sleep.
Weed counts: Regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not remotely sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start calculating immediately, and that is not quite encouraging.
What the jungle camp has to swim with missing medals
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself through Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had picked up gold for the first time at the short-way world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now, the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has put itself protectively from his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country in which an Olympician receives 20,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€, no one should wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on Friday on his Facebook site.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so precisely or even do it in the topic of Doping.
"I don't say that the checks should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
Similarly, we should keep it with countries.
"If no time before the WM/OS can be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controls, it is not allowed to participate," calls the Hamburger, who currently operates an ice cream.
Airport: Bande of baggage thieves caught
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of the Düsseldorf Police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspiciouss had committed several bags and bag tyres as a band.
By 21:30 a.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several complaints since mid-July this year and had been jointly, work-particularly and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves who had been engaged in the encounter of crimes to Germany.
They had a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Lindenbaums, intermediately a rest of the headpiece: The Riga's street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work on the first view, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go along the road from East to West, you'll be over to play places, a freshly stretched children's garden and a bioshop.
On the façade of a grey house, somebody sprayed "huh!".
On the other hand, a lime that is to be cut off is already built: Until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.
However, articles about this "third city", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferable in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rent contracts, but in the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
Especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has been speaking several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police officially said for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from joining the house with number 94.
During the time, building workers renovated the rooms in order of the unknown household owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the space had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers departed under the joy of sympathisers and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: Parents walk with children, people sit on the citizen's beach in front of the houses in the sun, others enter the form of late entertainment.
A basic school and children's gardens are located in the immediate vicinity of home projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is particularly generous from the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and renewal.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wished to protect the majority of police against vandalizing links.
The grave, which the Berlin interior and the police between house owners and their neighbors opens, seems not to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects born there are already a long time in Kiez: 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the whole Mainzer street near the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been pursued under large police command in a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnetic for tourists and electorates from all over the world: now, with them, people from DDR times and former house owners share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: They are recognized on threaded discs or freshly stretched facades, which were made with color bags.
No other road was so often mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors consider this a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the crimes are damaged, which tends to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no reason for uncertainty.
As regards violent acts, she is absurd: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Also the famous burning cars have no longer been given directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architect is not her street a criminal focus, the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
New builders have consciously moved to the Riga's street - and remained.
That's why it was so important for her that the people came back to their streets: from the police, politics and media, who suddenly demanded the highness of interpretation over the city in July.
However, in the eyes of inhabitants such as new builders, the road will continue to be taken away from them: by sightless new buildings in former building holes, which disappear the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well inclined," she says.
"Word and destruction I can't definitely approve."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the inhabitants.
For attracted people who are worried about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes belonged to Kiez.
Whoever moves, should be aware of it - just as someone who moves into a knee quarter can be bad about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters integration and organizer.
In addition, she is a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all players: refugees, occupational refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else are mixed with.
Regine Customer from the Labour Circle indicates that the honourable officials are more than grateful that Deushle is now there, the egg-learning woolmilksau, which has a problem, especially.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than rather the many of the tasks requested - would have meant as the administration wanted to describe the office.
An administrative expertise was requested with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-year experience in social work, just a egg-learning wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle says.
In particular, it is about organization, work with the people on the site and also behind the cults and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has deadlined a 50-percent steel to three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deutschle supports honor and principal actors.
There are major and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting.
They must put the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The costs of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility is switched from the country council to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every hire wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work so far that you're in charge of private apartments, so Deushle.
Consequently, communal apartments must be cultivated, as it is so beautiful.
So soon, new containers will be placed in the laundry road.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deutschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are practical places, training centres, schoolplaces, single-Euro jobs and help activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine Customer.
Many are working in the building or helping housemasters, performing non-profit work - and that is motivated and very nice, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.
This is "no employment therapy".
Activity, however, does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Destroy and customer.
People must develop a belonging feeling.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So here also administration and honourable officers are jumping in.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can overcome the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, may not work and be unnecessary, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people with nothing." Therefore, the work of Deutschle and Customer is always to motivate others.
It's all a "mammut task" already.
A difficult question: Are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent events?
"No," says Regine Customer very clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk could and do not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the attackers would give them a full prosecution.
"You want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
The main and honourable officials must therefore look forward to activities in the local and regional area.
They always have in the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany have a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics are shocking.
Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we were going," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already in charge of integrating the past people reasonablely.
These are about 100 people at the moment, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complex, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Inbreaker with helicopter search
The police helicopter fled for about an hour from different areas - unresumed.
Two unknown men are violent in a flat in a multi-family house in the Lindenway at 8.50 p.m.
