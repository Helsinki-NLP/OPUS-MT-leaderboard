What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort or the "Conditory".
The new governors of the capital of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the urban representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once been a little "coupled" by members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as it has dominated the notorical serpent that has joined in recent years in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the ruder.
The codated vocabulary, introduced in the flooded era of captain Pavel Bém by Prague's political elite, is rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils of these new terms showed a bit in the dark.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new man in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new council for culture, reacted to the test of the "Paten-Wortskatz".
But also the President of the Council, Mr Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present here to me that I sometimes use."
"Otherwise I don't like a lot of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the Actuálně.cz in this June before the ODS election congress, the redaction picked out six terms, especially those that are notorically linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague golfhole", "to the conditory", "Stiernacken", "Trade of the Capital" and "Verbanden".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future chief of Prague's schoolwesen - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even dismiss the listener.
The Fifth Chairman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from before.
"These things don't matter to me, and how the citizens' democrats talk to each other, I don't judge it."
"For me, how we understand in our programmes," he argued.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned line was not supposed to have recognized that the impressive entrepreneur and friend of the ex-oberburger champion Bém, Roman Janoušek, is the speaker.
The term "voldemort" says Kaucky nothing and the only term he correctly obtained during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, adding to security, "But I know that rather from the newspaper."
And weird, "I think I'm going to have to make a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only distinguished by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the President of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats, however, know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure, and by doing so, "to go into the conditory".
"I think that is to go into any Prague gastronomy operation," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušeks companies.
However, in conjunction with Březina, he cares that he had created these knowledges from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
In fact, it seems that there is no similar inherent serpent among socialists to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like that really not in us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use accelerators or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues call me like that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tested the name and see there - he works.
Councilsherr Weinert is friendly to the partymates of the "olde" or less friendly of the "Alte", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made attention to the elections by makings at the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are the only one to allow social democrats to speak in the interior.
Hulínský would not like to call him "Hulda", but Denik Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the President of Prague.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber law" claims to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor jurisdiction at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to undermine the torture of "hexen" and gave out a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social features.
They are rather part of the older generation, they do not find any work - for example for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
If one of these women becomes "hexe", she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Young and healthy women are still sparing this because she helps with the work and bears children," a ordinary sister describes the situation in the capital of the Western African state of Burkina Faso in a specialized home for more than one hundred women who have been exposed to their communities.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And, for this reason, gave out a brochure to undermine the "hexen pursuit".
But the thing has a hack.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed the newspaper "standard" to the dilemma of written information.
However, hexery is being prevented from being carried out in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured from three women and two men to death - they just poured them over with petroleum and fired them.
This incident also reported to the server BBC.
The actors claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil was flammed, which is used for ritual anointings.
And after the group has tried to "extract a evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexen" supports people here without respect for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresses of human souls are at risk before today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to eliminate the hexen hunting, the Gambian President himself has coincide in order last year.
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt died, devoured a monstrous witch hunting, as they claimed they had a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called Shamane from the near Guinee for help that, in conjunction with policemen, soldiers and the President's bodygarde, were electively captured women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," the organisation advocated Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the incorporated people were forced to drink a absurd from plants with hallucinogenic effect, but also resulted in tarm and kidney problems.
Two of the arreted people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
A renter of Bakala: He warms up in the oven - still pays higher rentals
An elderly subscribed man is just leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Cohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rent apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a catalogue with three new rental contracts for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son who just punish a penalty.
All three were just raised in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rentals, the son is supposed to carry for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category of 4100 crowns next year.
"And there is not even a flowing hot water in the apartment and you need to heat in a simple coal oven," he tips annoyed with the finger on the new lease of the son to whose signature he has a full power.
"But something - I have signed," he declared half wrong and half resigned.
The Citizen's Association of BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the renters to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish a guidance on how to act against such contracts.
But the man just wins off.
"One says this, the other one," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes the large "deregulation lab".
After a new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in Czech Republic, whose renters do not pay market-right rentals.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG Warning room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and with her are a calling device.
"Mieten 2011", then a special keyboard will light on the touchscreen.
Shortly typing, and the device already sucks out a number list.
We've hardly broken the number "157" and already pieped it on the large display on the deck of the waiting room.
A half a second later you're on the line.
Something later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the crash in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the coupons with the new leases are flattered by the majority of the renters of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the mailbox.
The RPG Byty suggests an increase in rent from about 15 to 38 percent in writing.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs something over a week, which means that it is only the beginning," the ladies answer behind the switch after a moment as the "client" disappears as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek, who came from Ostrava, had taken this topic quite loudly, not a wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new soil from them."
"Not a good time. WC glasses were able to exchange them," the man mentioned in the first time makes themselves air.
Until now, the employees are particularly employees at the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental reduction, which promises them RPG if they sign the special offer in time.
In the enjoyment of a reduced to half February rentals, the other tenants who sign the new lease until 15 December will also come.
Until now, the "deregulation switch" is in Havířov but everything else than overloaded by demands.
"From the 360 clients last night, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals were here in 2011," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual leases, where necessary, both on their websites and wall tables.
If the rent parties do not agree on the new rentals, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to understand as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on his websites.
"No one goes in court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client centre gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 pensions, of which I remain 5,000 for dinner, where I should take the money for a judicial dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be uncertain.
"Sightseeing."
"Lord Zaoralek tells them about the media, they shouldn't sign and so people are still waiting," she recalls.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the rental increase is an economic need.
"The existing amount of rents is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the critical negligence of the housing fund, according to the household owners, is the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG could invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it will be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling against the polster seats in the waiting room of Havířov, there are always a few red lighting information.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means at least 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," is read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rental by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase of extremely low rental prices from 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rental remains at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rentals to the height, but is gradually done within four and eight years.
What else - the company is engaged in another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see chart) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and heating.
But it is a priority to benefit the people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But who would already expect a minichild garden here, with everything that belongs to: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outer terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees last year.
The projecting and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the ateliers come from a number of narrow buildings, was calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the spaces for its minor gardens.
In a wise prospect, for most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree age and the company is attended to return to their work as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shortened, the children's garden is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers and architects have so much easier to put their demanding occupation and child care under a hat.
The Mini Children's Garden is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to win funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs for their project.
The Minichildrengarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of 2,8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be acquired and for the duration of 2 years are provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the exploitation of the funds (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the minichildrengarten 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, while the Society of Economy Rating provided effective assistance in the process of application.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a children's garden teacher, the children's garden can visit without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini children's garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day is changing across several children.
The child garden operation is flexiblely adapted to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the child garden - without prejudice to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini Children's Garden is still comparable to the pre-training framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can throw a look at the children at any time, and then stress is disappearing when the children are retrieved from a far away children's garden.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
No wonder that there are natural and loyal employers' relationships here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies who offer significant benefits in the advertising of new employees, who are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudi
The roof courages like the back of a prehistoric Echse, the stairways like the spine of a dinosaurian and the balconies are reared fish furniture.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the present inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes received the nickname "Kneckhouse".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the shaping fassades and all-time soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, thorough colors and textures that remind nature and living.
Only when you see more precisely, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-thought order.
In the night, the whole façade works even more plastic, dramatically and the special lighting increases the glossy of colors.
The same swing lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, lands, ceramic elements of doors, even guckholes and performances.
The Batlló house in the district of Eixample on the live shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from the year 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took place two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, originally resided on the departure of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, the hostel Casa Batlló did not expose Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade were his idea.
However, the design of the fassade also worked with many other artists and artists.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in Güell Park, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house received from the current inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nickname "Knew House".
Others again named it the special window opening mechanism because of the "smiling house".
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of the holy Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia, is represented.
But also other image-shaped elements symbolise hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical chains for the time.
Something bizarre already courages her 45 degree nigger.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations that were made at that time and did not allow any of them to be confused.
Before building, he obtained the corresponding construction authorisation from the city, but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so vacant that the city fathers two years later were so disposed of the result that they demanded remedial aid.
Among other things, the Council'slords argued that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public citizen.
However, there was no changes, in the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard - Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and she was immediately granted to him.
The house owner himself went into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor, there was a societal salon, in the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was poured into a jewelry business.
The entire six-stop building runs through a stairway to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and swinged walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors, and so a larger society could conveniently plunder without having to avoid a certain intimacy in confidential conversations.
The house also received an extraordinary roof and two other floors through Gaudís' reconstruction, except for a new fassade.
Impressively, Gaudís is also a game with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles that are clothed with the insideyard and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum measure of light.
In doing so, he made clear the principle of use that White reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight in the opposite.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
In the first floor, the spaciousest and most prestigious apartment of the public is made available.
The owners of the house decided only in the year to this step and this from the date of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly acceptable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to other common rooms and the roof rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building memories is not a paperboard steel, it is EUR 16.50, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist exhibitions receive 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entrance prices to other Gaudí funds in the city.
If anyone wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers, try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other wishes than men
Not the finest bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rose make the good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the health condition and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Similarly, the interior is also important in which matratze and rose have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not frequently heated, latex matrates are not well suited because they need much longer to "heated".
In addition, they are clearly more severe than usual polyurethane matrates.
And they should be turned regularly.
For if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, humidity is dependent on: So it is not excluded that it is under its swallow.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what is used.
Whoever was a long time in abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layers are common, will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Would all Eishockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their cut off shoulders, fences and hips, they just need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a formal memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar-sick people suffering from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can not receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in pols termoons.
That's why I've been dealing with many Eishockey players for years ago, but other customers have made these matrates with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech producer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous eishockey player to appreciate the advantages of the Visco shoe.
This "wonder" actually works very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it embraces himself regularly on the warm body.
Nowhere it presses, in the night you don't wander around like after a heavy fight.
You're just sleeping much better.
The viskoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (woundbrand).
When you choose the size of matrates, you should still add the length of the foot soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman with a size of 180 cm needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should be available at least 90 cm long width, which is 180 cm together.
In single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comforts half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rules apply to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, you should still be enough space for the light-beaten arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the first master of the polsters and space providers, who have devoted themselves to the problems of healthy sleep and ergonomic furniture for years, and also presents this topic in special schools.
On a double bed everybody needs his own roast and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise nothing remains but to mount the roast in different heights and that is not possible in any bed frame.
Schaummatrats should be at least 14 cm high, matrates with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which should fall at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine polster.
"With the hand or when you put the feathers, you must not feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matratze requires a special type of rose.
Whole-polluted beds with mattress and undergrounds like co-growing Siam twins have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be lifted, and the reference cannot be washed, which is already going on today.
And as one night loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress becomes slow to a huge (and stopped seven).
That is why experts also reject advertising logs that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty.
Every thing has her When and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: in mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of the washable, subtractable transfers should not be discouraged, yet it is recommended to use a mattress censor that can be easily pulled and washed.
Even today, in general, matrates are manufactured with round-crew closure, so that you get two half after opening (in fact important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often occurs as the inequal struggle between David and Goliat.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of it!
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Similarly, they should prefer to supply the plate with ventilation holes (if there are not already) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with soft feather cores and fine polsters.
Polyurethane mattresses are not included in such a document.
For non-adjustable latting roasts with 14 to 18 feathers (Lamellen) are suitable for latex or sandwich matrates (also also combinations of latex and cocose), always pay roses with a larger number of latches, that is, from 28 to more feathers, with Lordosen support in the latch cubic area and the possibility of regulating the latch hardness.
Adjustable lamellen roses do not include matrates with feather skelet because they do not respond to the ergonomic display.
In addition to the setting of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a specific fixation of the feathers that enables the feathers to be pressed or even disposed of so that they can make it possible to induction the shoulder of the sleeper's shoulder.
An important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using "lord mattresses" soft zones for the shoulder area.
It is also thought of the ladies - these soft zones are in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, pointelastic wing feather systems (lattoflex) or roasts with pointelastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion feather.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thus reducing the tension.
But - when you use a bad ( too large and filled) headsets to the right mattress and the right roast, most benefits are lost again.
Here is also a faust rule: the headbox should support the head, its peaks should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large kiss appears, as it may, for example, the Scandinavia Rivers.
In the page position, the headbox (in combination with the shoulder discharge zone in the roast or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have commonly with the inclined (heu filled) stroh bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their bi-blends.
The new magic word is also called "Bio".
Instead of oil raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane shoes that are increasingly common to natural oils - for example rhino and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called for mattresses consisting of materials purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first were Aloe Vera.
However, micro capsules can also be used to spread fresh forest or lavendel fragrance when sleeping.
Here you also make a difference between husband and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used for men to absorb the heat and cool the body, the amounts for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red paprika shots rain the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes well warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matrates from cold shoe (he has larger pairs with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Through the combination of the different rigs (hearts) of cold foams and visco shoes, multiple zone mattresses, which know exactly where heads, hips and fences are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress one has 7000 kroner and more to be taken.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
Gumotex was given this advantage as the first Czech company.
You see, saving at the mattress and on the rose is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers who offer two matrates at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the matratze Duofreeze with the reference visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that incorporated the era of the viskoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic speed.
No wonder, they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in cool environment it is re-established.
So it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes optimally the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of pressure fire, but generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot polsters that are intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of your own children grows and then more and more parents consider to monitor them via GPS.
The system, originally invented for the flaging of cars, can just as well place people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently when the nine-year Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box, but soon it will not be larger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and fear, so they keep looking out for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the prize of disturbing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about herom spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes to tragedy," Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases such devices can be abused, for example if you put it in your bag without knowing it, but we had no such case to mention."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
However, his opinion is that the child should always know the purpose of the "Schachtel" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková pointed out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply dissolves it.
"Both very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"But the mobile phones first raised great expectations with the parents, but they can be disabled as easy as these new monitoring devices," said Mrs Bočková.
Your opinion is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper almost always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring devices found broader use, they would also look for them, as their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the criminals of the police are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
It admits, however, that similar devices can be very helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from the Company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for automobiles and for persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"On expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and stay unmovingly, the device immediately sends a warning with an indication of the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to include a special software.
The problem of the current location equipment is that it is either about equipment in the carton size, the trailers are similar or about smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
Mr Pilin from the Macro Because, therefore, you are tested in the present equipment that looks like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the attacker may not have to realize at all that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Of he notices that only after some time what the police give a time propulsion," he adds.
No matter what direction the development goes - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to combine the location function using the GPS system (i.e. the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignitions that you could transform entire Czech Republic, but you could only keep two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignition, with ignitions.
In the previous year, the Defense Ministry had already delivered 224 kilometers of fire to the army camp.
It is calm to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the ignition - two, at least four years.
The army bought the ignition door from the share company STV Group, i.e. for lipic 40 million kroners.
In his reason for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition, the General Staff MF DNES answered that the soldiers would use the 60 kilometers of ignition each year.
According to the research of army pyrotechnologists, MF DNES spoke of, this statement shows that the whole army must have a very intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence minister Alexandr Vondra and army owneral Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way, the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition was half-way justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detections.
But these army stocks would also be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts is to say that to train each new professional soldiers, two meters of ignition is sufficient, the army has created a comfortable stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in the view of the increased need for pioneers and special units.
In this case, soldiers of the Quick Entry Brigade recently complained at Minister of Defence Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handfire weapons, so that shooting of the missing means is severely restricted.
Quiet from underhead deficiencies.
"I don't even agree why they buy such a lot of ignitions from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer mostly," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defence Ministry, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fire so that the army would have covered himself with this "munition" at least for ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year duration of use of the ignition and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"In perfect storage, the four mentioned years are possible," one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be in charge of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, every ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not threatening the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not insufficient, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Defence Ministry is the quantitative discount for the 445 kilometres ignition.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last year delivery of 244 kilometers," Pejšek tells us the position of the purchasers of the Defence Ministry.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignitions by the police pyrotechnicians, liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army, has been almost 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only those amounts of this ammunition that it can consume before the duration of use.
As a result of the safety of pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchasing more modern and thus also of reliable ignition is also open.
Nevertheless, the Defence Ministry has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakians were preparing for their championship to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnists, MF DNES spoken, the Czech forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old ignition, which she has bought today so "favourable".
Until today, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious place in the competition "Small Enterprises of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun selling the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Enterprise of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success courages like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad, he was aware that in Liberec, it is lacking good nightlight possibilities to reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation in abroad and by means of a bank credit, he created a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a high school student in the sixth semester at that time, this was certainly a courageous entrance.
"The price-quality ratio then angry me, and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit into the house, which he then rebuilt step for step to the pension with 54 beds.
He has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in only seven years.
The most comfortable of them was recently the "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé that we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the Franchise of the Pytloun Hotels have already reported themselves," says the entrepreneur's number One of the last year.
"Great share in this license sale for the operation of hotels had just the victory in the competition "Onders of the year", adds Mr Pytloun admittingly.
The victory has brought him greater knowledge, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really good," he recalls.
I really recommend those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't even have to win, every visual design is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and knowledges that it wouldn't have come to.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relationships until today."
The commendation associated with the success is to say that his view is also a little lower on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and proudness that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I do not really think this is just personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just put in the foreground," Lukáš Pytloun said modestly.
I wish my followers a more quiet year than we had in farm
The victory was rapidly triggered by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, farm has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year received Karel ↓árský, the farmer's owner.
The jury at that time appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this assessment has encouraged not only myself but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year winner.
At the beginning of farm's business history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the State offered his father Karel Ž Îárský as a compensation for the property confused by the Communists a small workshop for the pacht, he did not hesitate for long, his career in the company where he was employed until now, sausing and founding with a few of his father's companions a own company for the production of plastics.
Shortly later, they began focusing on plant oil presses.
In 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only by the success of the competition and the medialization mentioned, it has also become aware of non-professional publicity.
"Not only that our customers now consider the farm brand more intensely, our foreign partners also began to cooperate with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to measure greater value," says Karel Ž ́árský.
The last year, however, was not only in the sign of the victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for sale of tool products.
The crisis that then shocked the citizens, but above all companies, just reached their peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we could not escape this situation."
"The turnovers fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take into account releases," explains Karel Ž
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded to handle the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, even with less profits, than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to draw off - investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired principal prices at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover grows again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," lets Karel Ž
A question of opinion that is cleared by unfair rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some unfair rules have already been able to get out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year of the opinion survey "absurdity of the year" the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
So more than one third of unprecedented four thousand voiced entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Insurance Administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have obtained it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this changes now.
"The Czech Social Insurance Management will no longer require extraction from the trade register in the future in the control of social security payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Bura\'ová.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion question "absurdity of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupe of the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the indignant.
This is part of an entrepreneur's competition this year, organized by the Tsch. Economic Zeitung (HN) and enjoyed in the public growing popularity.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, they were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to prevent business activities.
"As regards, for example, the number of forms of income taxes, we take ahead in the world," says Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years is the proclaimed objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic takes the 74th Rank in relation to the business conditions, compared to the previous year, at eight places worse.
The competition of the year's absurdity was called out for the first time in the year and plays each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic discomfort from April to the end of the competition.
For the registration, the website is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contractor chooses seven candidates for the "Antiprise" and will vote the public on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most voices.
This year's opinion survey has already been notified more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless rules and arrangements.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay for wall or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of competition.
The calling of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November each is part of a happening, which regularly also involves individuals of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Sobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the highlight of competition with the party.
"Where the State throws the businesses a knob between the legs, there can be no real economic rise, therefore it is my goal to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year that are still unnecessary to the entrepreneurs," Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and Trade, informed.
The efforts to create unfair arrangements from the world show effectiveness.
In 2007, people disrupted most of the entrepreneurs' duty to report to the trader at the place of their permanent location three days in advance, with an exhibition stand to a exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was suspended by a novelle of the trade law.
The duty to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the worker's service travels for up to 30 days - was eliminated by the law on them so as to "green map".
And all good things are three:
For the desurity of 2009, the regulation, which imposed it on physiologists, was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two individuals in the speaking room.
This regulation was somewhat painted by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category values socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A news in this year's fiveth year of competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "responsive company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support those companies that are aware of the impact of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, the caller and guarantee of this competition, is as well as the competition "Rebell of the year".
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition of Vodafon Company, companies noted for which the success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and bails enough material for an independent article.
Although they distinguish diametrally with regard to the subject of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here, for example, is about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which encourages the development of non-formal sport teams among their employees, which then participate in many tournaments in various sports types.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also an example of the care of her health-disabled employees, representing 70 percent of their employees, for which it was honored with the title "Administrative Company of the Region of Central Bohren", and in the competition of Vodafone Company of the year, she has the third rank in this region.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced a floating and also reduced working time to average 35 hours a week and without proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment," explains her manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT business Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem is reversed to the health of his employees, and therefore it has bought them to all notebooks ergonomic seats and keyboards, and also encourages them in their employees homework and uses cartering services, which are offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "Men in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the current Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
The activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region is also worthwhile, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We donate our employees contributions to the meal, for the way of work, for increasing their qualification and for vacation," says Joseph Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Schlesische region.
As regards the category of responsible company of the year, all district finances of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer at the latest until 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the lawyer companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "responsive company of the year", but in the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, since it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organised agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public procurement
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in the last days.
The current media business and real estate dealer Luboš G. was deducted from the detectives in handcuffs.
This claimed that he had tried to manipulate a precise public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the grounds offered in the competition were covered by a specific stakeholder.
This is supposed to have paid a half million Luboš G. for it.
"On this time I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the infringement of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the Chief of Pilsner State Advocate of the newspaper "Právo", could not give further details as regards the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In the way he was able to manipulate public competition, you can only imagine it in view of the exceptional official information.
The speaker of the soil fund Lubomír Černá pointed out the question of Právo, the police actually held arrests in the Pilsner side of the soil fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and was not talking about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct name "Announcement for the offer of claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the offered property.
"These persons offer in the context of the call for a higher value of their refund claims to be levied by the transfer than the purchased land value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined, the ground fund then transfers the ground to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was evidently available for information who had registered on the call and since he was self-authorised person, as he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat finding.
This would also be an adequate explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Earth Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota, which was criminally persecuted because he gave out in replacement refunds grounds for which location decisions had already been adopted in construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired, for example, lands intended for the construction of public streets, at the place where the construction of the access magistrale was planned to the Borské pole business area.
Later, he showed this very cheap with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the landscapes far.
The council had to give a heavy heart in order not to threaten the construction project by blocking the grounds.
The housing costs of households increase by a few hundred months
Households must not only be charged with higher costs for all energy types from January to January, but also with higher water and waste fees and for remote heat and some places also grow the rents.
Since January, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner monthly more from the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes more expensive than 4.6 per cent, gas by 2 per cent and more, in some cities you will need to pay up to a tenth more for water supply and some places also deprive the remote heat supplies.
The households cost some hundred more annually in electricity alone.
The strong flow prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so the debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, mainly from photovoltaic systems.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely then when people have to heat most and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with a few hundred kroner more per year.
While electricity and gas become expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for remote heat are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January have to pay more for remote heats for up to 50 kroner monthly, more than 1000 kroner more per year paid families in Liberec.
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Prague threaten 9 percent to higher water and waste water fees and this if the city increases the infrastructure rentals.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still the lowest compared to the entire Czech Republic.
In the northern trees, where prices are now among the highest, water and waste water fees are to increase by 7.4 per cent.
A huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140.000 rental apartments where the rental regulation falls away from January.
For example, the CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rents by 100 percent from January.
If you do not agree with this increase of rent, it wants to be legally interested in the company.
The regulated rentals that are still paid in nearly 300 000 apartments are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and room beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, room and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky that you stole the father from the housebar.
These are the drinks which have to be treated most frequently after the enjoyment of the Czech teenagers under fifteen.
No exception is children who have to sleep out again and again in the hospital.
This is based on the experience of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of the children’s departments of clinics.
"Bies or wine are completely out of fashion because it takes just too long until you are drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the children's department in the Mediterranean Clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it manages to escape a bottle from the housebar, and if not, then at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"The most frequently about Fernet or Room."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at basic schools."
"Only it was also about Slibowitz that was taken from home," said Mrs Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán says that thirteen or fourteen years of drinks in the hospital recording are no exceptional appearance for long.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he worked since this year, he was working in the Pediatrie department of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars were drowned students from Nah and Fern.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"It was in the exhibition area in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home 48 hours," the chief wonders.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in attacks with their own sprays is considered one of the main causes of growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependency in the true sense of the word in children.
"During alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependency is to be understood by alcohol as well as all the phenomena associated with it, and that is not the case with these children."
In those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is characteristic," says Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the Motol Hospital, Mrs Jurinová, said that until mid-November, about forty drunk children were invoked to this department for children and youth medicine.
However, only cases with severe alcoholic poisoning, which required a hospital stay, enter the statistics.
Drinked children who are brought home after ambulance treatment by parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of scraps in the school bank, there are three years of amplitudes of age, which are 100% of their leave: Walpurgisnacht, silvester and the end of the school year.
"That was the last thing for two reasons - either because of the bad witness or of the joy of the holidays."
"I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the night of the Walpurgis," emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who only has to fight with a unpleasant cater next day.
The headaches in the morning after the dehydration and glucose deficiency can be displaced in the hospital with a fluid-sensitive infusion with glucose and nutrients that lack the organism.
"They are obviously better on it, because after the "lorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good loud without that anything hurts."
"You're only a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, which sometimes disturbs the patient with a good loudness by counting them the costs it's going to cost.
For transportation with the rescue car and the night in a battery bed comes well and likes to a few twenty thousand crowns.
"I have used this as educational means once I have calculated directly to the children at the Visite, what has cost their drinking and that it can happen that they have to work over all the holidays to earn the money for one such feet," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, he believes that the hospitals are not taking into account regression procedures in order to call for the costs necessary for the healing of the drowned children from parents.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighting planes L-159 of a total of five who exchanged the Czech Defence Ministry against the Casa C-295M transport plane, fled on Tuesday into the Spanish city of Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
In abroad, they were only seen in manovers or flight shows.
This is about the flightable two-sitzer version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are lonely L-159.
These are currently unconservated in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken it last week.
When she expedes the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defence Ministry, is not yet known.
On the other hand, the sole battle planes L-159 were excluded from long-term enclosed aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-seating L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-site fighting planes, since the Defence Ministry in May 2009 signed a 200-million-million contract on the conversion of four overflows of L-159 to two-site versions.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second will take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to carry the battle planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, it is clear and clear that the company EADS is the receiver of the aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to serve for the training of pilots in the NATO countries.
"It is therefore the case of the receiver in the way he realises the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion kroner had still been approved by Mirek Topolánek's government last year.
The Defence Ministry had not written a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Assembly argued that this exchange will support future L-159 exports to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which she only used 24, the rest wanted to sell it.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is expected to have a judicial reputation.
The European Commission complained about the Czech Defence Ministry at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, which is last to land on the airport of Kbely within fourteen days.
Longer graphic finger than ring finger means a lower risk of being sick of cancer
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are evidently exposed to a lower risk of being sick of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to be associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this can be done in particular in men to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should carry out a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, added Mrs Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with their colleagues in Britain, while 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the finger of the right was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostate cancer was considered as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and show fingers were equal.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men to sixty even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was exposed to in the breast mother.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer show finger.
Earlier research showed that just the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech genetics and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was promptly known to him, yet he does not think the relationship between the fingerlength and the cancer risk has proved to be "full".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking roads, mostly fastened snow, the winter servants were many places all night on axle.
The motorway D5 between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is locked by cars and cars for some accidents and the D1 at Brno is "toward Prague".
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
At miles 91, a truck was unsuccessful, at kilometres 93 two trucks collapsed, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at 185 km of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also been collapsed here.
The drivers should travel right behind Brno at 190 kilometres or travel over Brno and travel 182 at the town of Kyvalka.
There's a mileage of vacuum.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened and this is the same as when you go to Prague.
In Prague itself, a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form themselves in the city part of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is, at least, the Metro.
The roadways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace.
At 8:00 a.m. the Prague crisis stabs together.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Train had to cancel seven high-speed connections because of snow deformations.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Berun.
The travellers should necessarily inform themselves about the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Most roads in southern marrows are only accommodated with increased caution.
At Vyškov, three sideways are totally inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno, and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snowseeds on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still fully locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here you will also have to use snowseeds for the cleaning of snow.
When they get rid of again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is given in the area of white carpates.
On the roads that may be distributed for natural protection only with inert sprays, one up to five centimeters thick snow deck led ČTK.
In Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, mostly in northern trees - standing up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährish-Slesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
But in Czech Republic it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and move the force relationship to their favor.
The new gun is like a super-good canone.
Their projectiles are led to the goal by laser with a meeting security of only a few metres.
The special fires of caliber 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and contain high explosive explosives, function practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed so that they can explode at any point of their ballistic train, not only when it comes to the target.
That means, you can use it against an enemy who is hiding behind a obstacle - a wall or in the protective grave.
From above, it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splitting rain from above can easily put it out of war.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new fight gun is the first infant weapon that makes itself use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is actually doing so: he shows the target and sends out a laser radiation that determines the distance, then he wins a precise point of view after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to print.
"Well, let's say, you've measured 543 m."
"When you press, the gun is loaded up and shoots the fire to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu Group transfers his establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be moved from the previous office building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves his establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry's specialized in computers and their maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed on their work in July next year from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyon's street in the Frankfurter District of Niederrad.
One speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should be still 100 jobs of the group, which have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park would be better at the work of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been renter.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent transfer of an important company in the region yesterday gave joy to winners and disappointment among losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezern Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" had been won.
This is a "great location knowledge".
Fujitsu fits to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for the Lower wheel.
The Bad Homburger Oberbürgermeister Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendship contacts could have changed nothing to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the hire of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the outcome.
Now it's about to prevent a long empty position in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and hire of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the cottage and the nearby "Kleine vertical" were among the most controversial buildings of the Kurstadt, with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between the station and the Councilhaus, a new city centre was created, both due to the massive construction of the previously used areas as parking and the height of the buildings of criticism.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, the start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group in 2006 together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold on to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu Consumers in Tokyo call themselves the third largest IT provider of the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are in Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location should be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, Astro Park's office building was hired 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-formed base ris, among other things the Central Association of Electrotechnics and Electronics industry has its seat.
Amazon locks server - threats to Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in distress.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has banned the disclosure platform by its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after publishing hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
The WikiLeaks Discovery Platform is increasingly in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American servers and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Yet, the prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileyaks.
And Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, who is on the list of flags of Interpol, is supposed to stay after a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks disappeared by Amazon server."
"Free Speaking in the country of the Free", the discovery activists communicated by brief news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Soon before, the Internet company had banned Amazon the Wikilateaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic depths in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to say, "Prima - our dollars are now spent to occupy people in Europe."
If Amazon had such problems with the freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his servers by Wikileyaks after the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had undertaken research, the television broadcaster CNN reported at the office of Lieberman.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection threatened Amazon with a boycot, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," the Senator said.
Lieberman therefore called on to discourage the use of the platform for servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unhearted and unreasonable approach puts our national security into line and threatens around the world's lives," said a communication from the parteilos Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikilateaks to spread stealed material in his efforts."
The Wikileaks founder of Assange, which is sought by the authorities in Sweden because of a suspicion of violence, is on the flags list of Interpol.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks-speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange feared his security, said hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former republikan governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikitleaks explorations be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of Head of Government Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said in television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drohne".
Between the White House and Assange, a stroke was burned.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "incredible and absurd", that Assange had requested the withdrawal of foreign minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spionage calls for diplomas.
"I'm not sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American Government now puts the protection of its databases fully on the test stand.
As a special representative, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, shared the White House.
Travers should be responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms", which were needed after the disclosure of the message reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to check the way the government exchanges and protects information.
The American Government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and actors, they should be threatened by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said External Officer Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice sculptors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German something old-from the ice-sconditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spectacle, strikes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he won't pass by the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-university has set up the manufacturer of ice-machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several days' special courses around chocolatesis and practices in the home-owned ice pets.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare on the smooth ice of their vain petitions.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to put something on his own after years in a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewoman Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatine Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisively, not only is good taste, but also the silent taste and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the narrowing of the national and at all southern overbuilding: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romantics there."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano chills the basic ingredients of milk, granules, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns a hill on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice species.
Immediately, the docent will be stumbled with questions: Can Ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimental desire run free?
Luciano warns that it will not lead from time spirit to misleading.
Whoever speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used Stabilisators - mostly a natural product, such as guarfer flour from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sacks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
Spanning will be with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit department or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to touch you with dozens of aromatised additions."
"But you should just experiment."
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass that becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cocoa powder for all possible chocolate transfers.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanille, chocolate, mokka and haselnuss ice each with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanille aromas or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to the fruit species.
More flavouring substances, more fruit-pure - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not necessarily taste more nut if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis produces the work group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilising.
Only a balanced mixture raises the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eishmaking is a calculus task: If Pfirsich-pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A extraportion of sugar is required for lemoneneis.
Luciano extracts a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit species (winners measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Happyly, tables facilitate the computers.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device where the finished ice mixture is hit at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation to the despite, small pounds do not remain out.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues are decorated from the top to the bottom with fruit purée when the superdimensional Stabmixer excludes him from control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a question of time until something like that happens."
Controlors in the wheel
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the genetically experimented industry.
This pronunciation now forms the expert group Testbiotech, which is understood as an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotech.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years.
It is paid by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa tests for genetically planting and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The Efsa regulations are proportionate to Ilsi position documents and thus deceive the industrial manuscript, which is intended to be controlled by the Italian Parma authority.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech fails a collision of interest.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager was recently free of charges or transitional time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Mediterranean Rundfunk (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Environmental Association as well as EU parliamentaries clear.
The Efsa can not recognize any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry as long as they are of high professional quality, is stated in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not require them to have any contacts with the industry.
But they'd have to open up these.
Kuiper awards his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby order.
In the case, independent experts such as Dan criticise that geneticly modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding test in animals and the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences are not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing on the field," says Dan.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not all genetic plants, which do not provide reliable results.
"If you are not looking for the risks, how do you find it?" then asks accusing.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees like this.
The scientist has been researching in genetic technology since 1994 and is currently working at the Zürich Technical University.
Industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as well as in the United States, more and more in Europe.
Therefore, there are little researchers who are not flooded with groups.
Critical studies would not normally be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also has any concern, a total of about 400 kg.
On the Monday night, he was forming Stuttgarter Railway Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It cuts.
The story is known: In September, the Baggers were pitched and began to break a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgarter world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of heavy depth of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in rims.
Break in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he sailed, he smoked to cigarette quality.
What he'll do with the brocks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgarter stones leads into a forest at Tübingen to a former Munition depot of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone-rich.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would paint to Schotter or disappear in the deposit," he said in his office, a wooden farm that once was a watchhouse.
He was deceived and threatened, he told him when in September the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern flour from the interruption operator.
But he talked to the S-21 winners for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the Abriss.
And if it happens now, it is the most reasonable thing if the stones would continue to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 winners then took one of the 80 kg heavy quader in the average, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large trucks.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housekeepers.
They had come from everywhere and had dragged away what bag rooms and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have been transformed into "Mauerle" for a long time or in limitations of herbs.
"This stone is really nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He climbs into his terrain car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura he studied and cancelled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stone stored is.
From all Germany, he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest dealer in the Republic.
It's braking.
In the snow there are artificially cultivated sandstones.
"You once belonged to Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He points to a hip: Red Sandstein, former part of the Karlsruher railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once, the quader belonged to the Tribunal of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, Red Granite from the Dom St. Blasien, Tuff from the Healthbronn Hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were previously hedged by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and oxencars, he becomes very honest.
"It would be a scandal if you screw something like that."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't already been rich in stone.
But 14 people are occupied by the stone dealers today, and also have settled themselves above in the forest stone mets, a sculptor, a slide, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the remainder.
Next time he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save there.
Speaking for High Potentials
There's reign Andrang on the buffet.
16 Students are pressing for lax broths, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobuilder Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In some kind of idea competition, they are supposed to be familiar with VW developers about the car of the future - and all alongside people's cars.
In the competition around the smartest heads, many companies are now going to the nearby struggle and, like VW, to cooperate with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and are reaped by others.
And since the universities do not publish statements about the services of their students, they are trying to find out the exceptional languages in practice projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group casts around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes bullets, rubber bearings and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of practitioners and student jobs and shows them ways in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig, the project is managed with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and collect experience."
"VW can at the same time meet students, look closer to interesting candidates and think who would be the employee in question."
Such collaborations, such as cells, are not unusual.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
"Once the focus was rather on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they have to be prized and especially balcing for high-qualified employees.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineer VDI, over 40.000 engineering stations remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunting.
He organizes outstanding recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern cutting hunting, where the participants need to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA in the next year.
Besides, participants can view KPMG films and meet the company.
Whoever is allowed, decides in two selection rounds in front of the field.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants fly to the United States.
In the hooks and hooks around the high potentials at the universities, the shots, according to Dykta, are increasingly growing.
"We want to remove the race from the mass."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent champion Dykta seems to be invoked.
"We have contacts with all the participants of a similar action last year."
"Some people are shortly in front of their conclusion and will soon apply to us," he says.
In addition to the direct bulb at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classic at professional measurements at the pirch.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"On the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, staff director of Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stöving knows about the emerging problem.
At present, 35 jobs are printed on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacation positions."
"That takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the Uni-Professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the university in Freiberg.
"The professors suggest that we can do practices or write his diploma."
Possible advertising measures are not indicated in solar specialists.
For this, the company is trying to advertise for himself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't offer a large group," says Staff Director Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good rise opportunities are further crucial factors.
Solarworld in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute sets up an annual best list of German employers.
To this end, employees ask how satisfactory they are with their work and job environment and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Personnel leader-in-service hopes that the positioning will also be a plus point with the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are particularly looking at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Warler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as a employer is to lead through your own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer Branding is called employer branding, i.e. employer brand training within its own staff.
"Confried employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat his people well and identify them with the company, they would advocate for their employers alone.
"This is like a game with bande," says warriors.
Obama stops new oil drills
There will be no new oil drills in the coming years before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A similar ban has been adopted by the government in Washington and thus finally revoke its previous plans.
Also before the Atlantic coast, new drills are banned first.
This was noted by Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosor for the strict ban, which is to be applied at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drill platform in April.
Before the accident that eleven workers cost life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to reduce the United States' dependency on alienation from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil pollution in the Gulf have not been declared until today.
In the centre of criticism, the British energy group BP is faced with billions of demands.
In December, an investigation commission of Obama's order should present its results.
In October, Inner Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stopper after the explosion.
Following this, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drill projects.
With tighter controls and more stringent safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been ratified by numerous corruption claims in prosecution, will be fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax flowers for the oil and gas companies.
Industry now warns publicly that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current sector survey by the BDO consultant - even before the rainfall ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will be correctly changed by regulation."
Investment in new funding projects would be suspended up to further - to the burden of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank station: billions of litres of raw oil has destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from stealing, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Apobari's saying it's good.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist calms the journalists, "You'll get enough oil slam in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to light up a kid to the breast in the water with its surrounding sleeves: In the rainbow-coloured water glance, the scene almost works beautiful.
That under the surface weaving brown oil sweats is not seen.
In the past, she suddenly collected yarns here, Esther Badom says on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipe poured out a lot of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to run six hours to get into fishing waters: The Ogoniland located in the heart of the Nigerdelta is one of the worst destroyed regions of the world.
On the ride through the mangrove soups carried through rivers, the entire extent of destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat cultivates brown breeches, who shows his hand into the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rag like black lacrete stalks from the ground, sadly let single-compassing palms hang their weeds.
Bird heats, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, are forgiving: as soon as the outsider sweats, in the like a tank station smelling earlier paradise spreads spensical peace.
"What happens here is environmental war management," says Celestine Akpobari window, "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The occupational area of Ogoni is a decade of battlefield: over 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe were organized here in the 80s, with the later accustomed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group in 1993 had to set up its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today, the company is defeated to return to Ogoniland: While the whole delta region broke from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometers pipelines daily pumped more than two million phases of black gold, the oil fields are in Ogoniland, the position is too instable to the group.
All a few hundred meters are stealing places such as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded up to the mark.
Once again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant electricity runs raw oil into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year for year, the amount of oil, as they had in the havarian of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" in the sea before Alaska 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU will be argued about it.
During the Shell Group Sabotage and the organized oil deep steel are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria lays much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner presented the 2008 group: only the rates of defects on the lines are "for a variety of higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like a leaved, oil-smeded workshop under free sky, appears from the mangrove shapes: they are divided and dispersed until the neck.
One of the many vessels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly spread on the ground, flakes a fire: an illegal small raffinery.
In the fashion the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
First, petrol pushes through the pipes into the cap, later drops at the end of the leadership of Kerosin and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four vessels diesel à 300 litres every day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira in" - about $22.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel deficit in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with nearly 40 euro cents per litre can still prohibit the illegal cooker: because their raw material gets them otherwise.
It comes from "bunkers" who take the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, at least 16 million litres of raw oil per day loses the country.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally destroyed: the proportion of lions fills organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tank ships and insists on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is rather debted to the circulations of the population or the salmon production mode, considers the activist Akpobari as a pure academic.
"If the oil companies wouldn't be seen as invasions and they wouldn't have destroyed the fishermen's life base so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor stealing or illegal raffinadery."
In the meantime, the Ogoni relationship was particularly to shell, but so destroyed that only a distraction of the group would be questioned: "Canbe other nationalities such as the Chinese are better than that."
Michael gets nervous.
"The maximum time you're disappearing," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil dealers are captured from the special unit of forces, they are not threatened to arrest, but probably a painful penalty.
Also, the soldiers who are mainly coming from the country order want to benefit from the raw material, as all Nigerians.
"This damn thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Explorer detects dangerous construction failures in A380 engineering
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Explorers have discovered a possible construction error in the examination of a disabled machine, which could lead to a "cassive tribulation".
The Qantas airline now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Qantas-Airbus had seemed to have known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major security problem in its investigations in the operations of some A380 machines - and now warns about a possible failure to build.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil sludge connection, it could produce fatigue and leaks, it stated in an opinion published on this Thursday by the ATSC Authority.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic tribulation".
Rolls-Royce's drivers are affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British Turbine Manufacturer.
It submitted a complaint at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which enables it to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would require compensation for the intermediary at the beginning of November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had solved and damaged the traction surfaces.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
Now, after the incident, up to 40 drivers worldwide must be exchanged.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the drivers concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSC speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
At a A380, the airhansa switched the engine as a precautionary measure.

National snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany all in White: Overnight almost all the country has fallen snow.
Chaos, trains and flights fall out on many streets.
In case of car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter frosts Germany: At iron temperatures, almost the whole Republic is cut to Thursday - which leads to transport chaos in many places.
In the north and east, some 15 centimeters of thick snow covers.
On several motorways and many roads, transport is strongly restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent operation, but was not finished with the ever-reflecting snow.
In addition, violent blows feathered over the East Sea Coast.
The Bundesamt für Seefahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) expects at the Baltic Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm flows with water levels of 1.2 metres above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow deflections on the motorways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the weather centre meteomedia, the alarm level was violet in Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Sometimes there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds.
There remained several trucks and cars in the night.
In Sachsen-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stocking traffic and vacuum.
In Thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to German Railway, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and in the north of Bayern.
Snow on the glasses, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed pipes and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, Fernverkehr from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be suspended.
A ICE to Munich had to stop his ride in the Thüringische Saalfeld.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemans and rescue helpers with clouds, foods and drinks in the train.
Snowwinds threw over the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight accidents.
In Munich, some cancellations have already been reported, according to a speaker of the air navigation centre.
According to a fraport speaker, 40 flights were already deleted in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in permanent operation.
Although only a few strange passengers at the airport are still available for them, almost 400 field beds are still available.
On many streets, accidents occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck rider died at the collapse with a train on a train passage in Eastholstein.
The Lokführer was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: also here a truck was covered on a railroad because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked up until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overwhelmed her car at Askapburg on a smooth road.
However, a good news has the meteorologists: Although the snow will still be lighter and powdery and therefore already turn up in light blows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - location up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for her twin storms
The German Bank wants to separate from its mark: According to a newspaper report, the money house seeks buyers for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to EUR 500 million could spend the property.
The German Bank has just made its group seat beautiful: the twin storms in the Frankfurt Bank district have been modernised; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the cost of renovation - and look for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a speaker.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check if it is more useful to own or sell property itself and then turn back," he said.
This makes Germany’s largest credit institution return its company’s seat after a short period of time.
The Bank had taken the double towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund and then refined upwards.
The energy transformation went down to approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Branch experts estimate the value of the "Greentowers" towers of the newspaper, according to about EUR 500 million.
Whether the buildings are once again sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, are still open, the speaker said.
Thousands sad about dead friend
More than 10 000 people in New Zealand have thought of the wasted mountain people who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the safety situation is still precarious in the cabinet.
Nearly two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there had been a huge explosion.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were discarded under days.
A sin had been left down in the cabinet, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could decline.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the friends.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now family and friends reminded of the dead with a Memorial.
Ten thousand people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island at the sunlight in Greymouth.
They're leaving for two minutes.
For the honour of the sheltered men of the mountain were 29 tables on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were seen.
Images and personal items, including clothing pieces and surf boards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags swept on half-mist.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he did not see his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shaken in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomas took part in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19, mountainmen had also been discarded from British and South African origins.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal yard on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were explosive, it was started to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit for the art kino?
Regisseur Nicolas Winding Refn relocates old genre borders with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner of Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) liberates from his pearls and carries around his opponents with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabiater killing methods and his enemies already rippe the intimids from the living body when he has bad lone.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says all the film about no word, and the other figures can be taken up to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouts.
Otherwise, it is swollen and swallowed in the huge hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikinger world has offered to the culisse from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Beautiful, if a movie has several target groups, only harm if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been considered as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version, but it refuses steadyly to make his works available to the arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most artistic kino friends are likely to get rid of the vibrant brain mass and the cereals.
The Action-Fans die in the last time before Langweile, when audience, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries through a ship to Jerusalem and puts a eternity in flaute and fool before the team appears to arrive in America and sweat there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a movie lease and now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a shame because of the beautiful pictures, but also because behind the beautiful to bloody fassade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this movie it's not about dialogues or a stringent action, it's all the atmosphere, a film-armed fiber space.
And there is no escape from it for the viewer.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and sniffs him with his ice pictures and the dark trance-style sound track very slowly to the throat, but especially with the incredible hatred that struggles against him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blonde boy who is faithful to the side of an eye, keeps something like innocent, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-august hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary bonds at any time become a warrior from hell, possibly to the messenger of the Devil itself.
He means corruption, but maybe only for those who are corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, for angry, exciting and exciting.
A experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country rejects to take its position - nor it allows controls.
By midnight of the 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I battle planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the ephrat's beach; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria claimed to have built with the help of North Korea in the quader, hides in a valley that departs from the electricity.
According to a letter from the end of April 2008 by the US Secret Service of Abroad CIA, the normal reactor el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifty is little.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unsharmed satellite images.
By computer animation, she blinded in where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Atom Center Yongbyon.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from the vicinity or even the inside room.
The reactor had been standing shortly before the in-service, said it, but was not yet covered with burning stamps.
Today, more than three years after the Bombardement, is hardly known more than then, even the puzzles became more larger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was quite sure that Syria built a reactor in el-kibar, but hardly saw points of point that there was an active nuclear weapon program in the country.
Some secretists in Europe prefer to be more careful and only speak of a "reactor" even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only lapidar, which IAEA has "good material to ask questions".
The shot of the claimed "unused military building" quickly created the Syrians at the side and planned the area thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found among the former Chief Specter Olli Heinonen in el-kibar tracks of uranium, which had been produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received commercial suppliers from a Member State directly after the attack that would be more prominent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always cared for never running a secret nuclear program or building a reactor.
The Uran comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
But this was unlikely for the IAEA after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as the satellite pictures.
In addition, it rejects the controlurs a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the drums of the bombed building.
But Israel also swears iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 has resulted without result, and "is increasingly developing to a serious religious problem for the Authority", as a high western diploma at the IAEA seat in Vienna - finally there is a serious violation of the nuclear locking contract in the area over which the IAEA is guarding.
As a key to progress in information, the IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the mutate reactor - and, different from that, still exist.
The inspectors have not yet disclosed the installations, their functions or their suspicion.
According to the South German newspaper, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah internally from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base point - exactly with this reasoning, Syria of the IAEA defenders access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a hint from the U.S. home services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader at the Euphrates material was transported and transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
There is, however, "no evidence of sensible activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reconstruction; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not rich.
However, where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium should be separated for the bomb later, there are at all plausible suspects about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether traps that could store valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truck charges were disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shot remained.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined on its suitability as a warehouse for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
Recording from the orbit, however, shows that Syria took on the three suspicious places of earthwork and removed large containers after IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomat circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - the effort alone shows the importance of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had western diplomas in Vienna still provoked a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not been high urgency, brings about U.S. Messenger Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections into the game, one of the most sharp means that the Vienna Atom Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who should suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "one option I am open for in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: first of all, it needs a majority in the IAEA Governor Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than inclined to eskalation.
Secondly, how a diploma is to think, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed governance in summer, there are troubles.
The turnbook wrote herself, a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it, but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is in love during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and there were some short-term turning days planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned off in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is self ambassador of the UN refugee aid.
Diplomatic isn't it - she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary for weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been given, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the turning book.
According to the UN refugee aid, her organization recommended to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received her turnbook, has, after some, granted a turning permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself cares that she does not pursue political intents with her movie, has worked with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, it remains vacuum when it comes to content.
This is how a second synopsis curses the film in the network, which then sounds quite different: the loved ones were able to get into it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is moved into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant "Accession sacrifices are crushed in torture servants".
That Jolies film actually starts before war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, says Jolie, is "unfair and based on error information".
Now you can only bring the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the turning book, as many as before, illegally on the network.
Nothing like the way out here.
That evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No trace of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans joy for joy in crowning loud music, they stamp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in the southern Cork is inclined because the players throw tischtennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer becher - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls the bizarre spectacular, to win there are 500 Euros victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the bierpong world champions in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this sharp drinking game and the backholding computer, that really doesn't match.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to entertain to distract from the boring question what will bring the future.
On his plan is not a game pace in Las Vegas, he will conduct an application conversation in New Zealand in January.
"I have a foolish feeling with it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I have no work there."
Anyway: His girlfriend in Auckland has already waited for him - " she had gone back, kicking her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiling.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have already searched for happiness in abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin has now a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will probably leave the country in the next time, as experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
Until 2015, they even expect 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
The predictions are, there is a wave of immigration similar to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the swing that brought great prosperity to the Irish, it is now again a tristses.
The economic crisis is particularly unassured by the young, well-educated Irish, for which only mountains have been raised.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, money was in overflow.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are readers of young immigrants who complain: "All things are going down in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one then please turn out the light."
Jura Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future growing because the government only carries out eyewitching and the young people no longer offered prospects for the future.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her commitments hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, it's to have to migrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round service on abroad work.
"For professional beginners, the work in abroad is a great chance to make the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website, show photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for a half year.
Since there was nothing to do with the 29-year engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues at the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they're just pulling up a fashion house.
In January it continues to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, his home O'Donovan sees only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, when he goes over the threshold of his house for a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as well as never again."
He's laughing a little ridiculous and walking through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a nice housing area with careful gardens, parking in the entrances large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 euros - 100 percent of credit funded.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan considers a while, pours hot tea after and says, "I have no children I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The engineer doesn't like the wound complaint he often hears at this time.
"No one has to hunger - however, our situation is far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel like ire."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he's already behind, and why should it not go well for him and his friend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still there that concerns him in these days: the celebration at his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could be in a life-welcome party.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a big shock of his beer.
"Beloved, that sounds terrible."
"We prefer to call it a walking party, very easy, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Route
Democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Criminality is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist, came to these results.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts fall particularly into the eye in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries at the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased considerably (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic supporters has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong invasion last year, such a trend is to be seen.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most popular countries of the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trusts the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermine efforts to increase democracy.
The fact that this continued during the world economy crisis may be that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(As reported by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year again.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the divorce president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more sensitive and has increased violence crime, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America in crime in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have decreased and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance reflects the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the respondents reported that the private economy is essential for development, it was 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, has confessed many private companies.
Brazil, according to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most impressive country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
An electoral flap
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28th.
But the facts were far from the fears of the electoral helpers who hurried the land to help.
Overfilled electoral tours, multiple abandoned votes, electoral certificates in the rinstone, destroyed choosing places and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Choice rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless through the earthquake in January, struggled around looking for a choice.
Finally, some gave up.
A dozen presidency candidate, including some contemptful peak riders, demanded the suspension of the election results due to a claimed fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN Mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the American States and the Caribbean Community, "this irregularities, as they may be seriously, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, who is obliged to the unfavourable divorce president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will proclaim the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected selection is made for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial inadmissibility complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only little or no consent to the voters, explains to the victory of the electoral election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and to the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a small participation was feared.
On the day of election, many Haitians were obstructed by the lack of organization to vote.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250.000 exams needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot in the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government to be an important step in reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy, which raised its popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if you help this again next year, it depends on whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more compromiseful than your dead husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led the economic policy after his wife's choice, often set up budgets which did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president's couple to issue extra revenue on its own.
On the paper the Fernández government last year lost the majority of the congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further destruction.
Some regim critics from the series of reigning peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary struck a different one and others insisted on the government of coupling) the Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I won't discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, which makes the President more able to spend money on his own.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of the trade unions - are at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fighting to its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused cooperation with the IMF, shined the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which thereafter enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now?
She called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, salary increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, wish to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government met an agreement with investment holders who had rejected the former redebt of the country in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which they owe about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected an audit by the IMF, as used elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of its term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which mostly has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinaners return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of the sympathy that was brought her will be depressed.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she suspends many political decisions of her husband quietly.
weak applause for China
Taiwan's voter is slowly approaching a closer connection to the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother outside the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all electives to choose in the five city districts of Mayor and City Councils. This is considered to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of railway-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for the relationships with the continent. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Mother had the test, but only slightly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) puts three of the five civil champions, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports the greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
At a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the vote share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the usual incidents in Taiwan, such as truck convoy with crwall makers, flag-swing mass trails and only punctuated dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the Chairman of the KMT, held a talk on a KMT candidate in the evening of the election,
When a man shot out of the crowd into his face, the line was hurt and a surrounded viewer killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the protector wanted to kill line or put a dispute with the candidate.
Indeed, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has impaired the choice and the DPP has put in a bad light, which the KMT has cut more voices.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationships with the mainland were not thematized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations to the government in Peking.
But this time the DPP also avoided the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese supports his China policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent a subcontractor to Taipeh to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has been newly invented.
Two years ago she was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he engaged in vehement for absolute independence.
However, under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of common politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of professionals and youths.
Tsai found great consent as a presidency candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Peking.
Tsai plans an idea sharing as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that their party offered a "trusted alternative" to Mas faster approach to China.
Chen seems very angry over this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to stand on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the practitioner Su to avoid the presidency candidateature.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to carry out its own self-analysis.
Mass values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to lead their electoral struggle without him.
The main reasons for his unpleasantness seem to be unemployment and the more and more gap between arm and empire.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports a renewable approach only.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic cooperation with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there's already no return."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear on a president's request, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to arrive at the ceremony at the nobel price award 2009. Now, the 26-year-old Jazz-Bassistin and Sängerin were finally nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since its album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the Jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules that an artist may have published before the release of the album with which he was known in the wide public, not more than three albums.
Your ambiguous album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its ambiguous voice and a good feeling for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a Jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings comes next.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics thus experienced a huge success.
One of the competitors of Iyers includes "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category contemporary Jazz, where otherwise more albums are found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-established attention in the category Big Group. Thus he admits against the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventure-lucky Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band Leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey run in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a bunte mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominated with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonists and led up in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of Avner Dorman, established in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Under the nominated classic albums, Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" are played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, mountains "Lulu from the Orchester of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchester and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composer, the "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was launched and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonians under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The about 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnets Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. indicated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specially for the Mandoline artist Avital, who conducted the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms," explained Dorman in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra offering for recording the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his leadership.
As instrumental solists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the Geigerin Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal solists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, the sopranistin Jessie Norman was nominated for their recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moskee in Temecula gains agreement from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula, after a five-hour public hearing, found the unanimous consent of the local planning committee.
Criticists proposed the project to promote terrorism and transport.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in line with local provisions and will become an aesthetic vision.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"As an American, this makes me proud."
"It shows justice."
"There are only few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre took almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to the Press Enterprise, were quite equally distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It is another planet of the monkeys, and the freedom statue is dead in the sand."
"American is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violencelessness.
His municipality with about 135 families lives peacefully for years in Riverside County, but they wanted a larger and better places than the camp they had rented together with a manufacturer for water filtering facilities.
The new, approximately 2.300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minorettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be found on the approximately 17.500 m2 large property on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen resistant microbes could allow new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria species, including arsen, opens new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view that life is possible without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to wax either phosphor or arsen."
"That makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'fremde' lifestyle," Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements were considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake also grows further when it replaces phosphor with arsen.
"There is a question of what else is possible," said the co-author of Ariel D. Anbar report from the Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in searching for outer earthly life, since scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were published on discovery, caused too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of discovery could take place outside earth's lives.
This is not the case.
The discovery "describes that in other planetary systems organisms can be started with other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' which are absolutely vital to us are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiological Institute of the NASA, which led the study, elected the Mono Lake due to the high arsenal content.
As arsen and phosphor are similar chemically, she assumed that microbes, both exposed, may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the chemical behavior of arsenic as phosphor."
"That makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so big that arsen works different from phosphor. It comes into our biochemical system, where it swells everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers put the bacterium GFAJ-1 out of an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphor, it can also survive in arsen, it shows that a arsen-based life form can occur, of course, either on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsen occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Doctor for Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphor can be replaced by arsen, is not new. But yet there was no working example.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life used it.
"There is a reason to assume that life could have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simons' research team.
Research was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Thursday of Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as an unknown one stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Fan, where the animals were put before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, the authorities say.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well on," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the hund’s foundation yet about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say this anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're pursuing some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district city house in Downey.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old Rood, and Didi, a 10-month-old Hündin, were uninjured, according to the authorities' statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Salvation, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show in other competitions.
South California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the pair from dog view to dog view.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer whip, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with in her motel room.
The thickly Akitas and Corgis stayed in the cart because it was cooler there.
They made the window open widely, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised everyone who could give a reference to the Corgis, a finder wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder's wage was paid.
The lion rebrews after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulencies and uncertainties, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Yorker bankruptcy judge blessed the "prepared" credit plan to decline the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year entertainment company the way for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will be present to the awesome studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which owns $75 million, leads the company. The funding is to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the contract to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial care and pay out more than 140 creditors of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few tenderers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the believers.
In spring this year everything started from the front when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the believers after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially overcome the bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co. that has already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which has been paid for the management of the company monthly $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one movie and created a year plan with seven or eight films to come into the cinema at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are to be created under the government of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget balanced
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can rippe a considerable hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring sails or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toys dealers - a whale mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own website appear, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, finds a broader offer.
There are increasingly more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable battery.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are pulp figures, as large as sea pigs, who sing a note when pressing on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song through multiple presses.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started pressing once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sand and dance, the dance Star Mickey (Fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic pope offers interchange games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the new scarnier feet with wheel blocking it controls the Moon Wall.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the missing volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Play school, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires, with which a car trip can become a lesson, with a better understander with autocorrection function as teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child’s smartphone, three independent alternatives are here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained therein are not as instructive as those on the leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, after Leapfrogs' first large revision of the Leapster series is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to compile the blocks in words before the time goes. It is great for an improvised bookstabier competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be a roller shoe or a puffle studio.
The latest head cell-operated microbots, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your dental brush.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrant silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a wrong garden of clothes.
And he keeps out of a few things.
Our man fell from the kitchen table and even passed some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police interventions in China become milder
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city place, checked his nervous submissions and gave commands with military authority and damned voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city's order, feared and despised for their arbitrary races and their hang to violence - to impress the viewers.
"Stop right!"
"Blick straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are like that!"
Four girls, hardly grow up the teenage age, stood stray with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight row.
Four ordinary hats sat perfectly on the blue-white slabs held on the hair.
"For me they look average," says Mr Tang insanely.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to pollute the picture of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a graduate.
Instead of the green, the Province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced violence by downstream stars: in 2009, 50 officials reported a unjustly established imbibic car and stared to the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 68,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the urban police strips. They have been selected specially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the grim police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may pursue urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the Province of Hubei broke a viewer to death when they filmed her with his mobile phone, how they swallowed a protest against a waste housing.
Last year, a training handbook of the Peking officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be crushed without blood forthcoming.
This year a Shanghaier had watermelone dealer after a handful of five officials suffered brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows in China trained officials at an attack on road dealers.
"Chengguan fears the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversies about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing".
Skeptics are insufficient to the current approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruitments in October by advertisement, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both of them.
According to job advertising, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for good figures and "harmonic facets".
You should be above average size - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment relationship ends with the achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too difficult.
"The most important thing is her image," an unnamed district officer admitted to the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, face traits, etc."
Then the temperament and "inside qualitys".
"Hibly Chengguan is like flower vases," he said, "but they have other duties beyond."
Zheng Lihua, vice-president of the city management of the district, does not want to attach this description,
However, in China, size requirements in job advertising are not inappropriate for both sexes.
The same applies to even face traits.
Whether this is similar to good appearance, it is in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"We can unfortunately not use lambs or buckles here," says Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang site near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel sexist that it was so much valued on her appearance.
"Do you know, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic view.
Her colleague commented with the graves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, since they had more ambiguous career plans than simply to suck dealers through the gases in order to prevent them from making business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve road dealers who try to sell at foot or on the bicycle as many breads and tofu courts as possible before they are hunted.
"Lord Wang, please get out of here."
"We've said this so often," says Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled to foot, leaving his nudel cooker fixed on a bicycle cart temporarily.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotony than enthusiasm.
"It is almost every day the same," explains Huang Jing, 20 who studys sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male officers.
This is intended to protect it from public oppositions which officials in China are frequently exposed to.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, who cursed the rumour, Chengguan officers had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were hurt at night, 14 government vehicles were cast or put in fire.
Xindu remained rescued from such violations.
But disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang site, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired in place of a workshop against the rules on the citizen's ceiling.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of patience, the officials walked to their vehicles with a cruel face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes, we'll go out of the mouth."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li refugees.
"The most of the time people start with the fight."
State lawyer will not accuse Senator Ensign
State lawyers of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were raised against him after his affaire with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobby activity, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe prosecution against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the country-wide coverlines and his career shifted a steamer, he considered the possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was very happy about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
The Senate's Ethics Committee could, however, impose another disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was surprising for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. You think there were sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were opened for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral helpers, took a lucrative order to buy his silence over a affaire with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was acting as a treasure champagne during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations he accepted for them after Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton had recently been in Ensign's electoral team, he had no lobby work for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely friends before the Affaire, disfellowshipped the so-called prohibition of the lobby lobby lobby.
According to the published Indians, "all things seem to be dealing with an agreement and the infringement of the turn door statutes," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialized in the defense of clients in the government's shower.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr Brand and other ethican practitioners said that the Ministry seems very careful in the taking up of political charges by a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to leave the accusation against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of the disadvantage of the prosecutor.
State lawyers "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US Parliament and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr Ensign before court.
"This essentially means that high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief defendant of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a lawyer on Monday and another on the next day when he was told that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defendant had cooperated with the lawyers in order to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the lawyers.
"I'm not sure to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Bundeswahlkommission decided to initiate the investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensigns parents to the Hamptons infringed against the Bundeswahlgesetz.
The electoral Commission said that there had not been enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton has passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Staffchef, John Lopez, had a speech with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was in the interior department because of a matter of "clope".
Mr. Ensign was also admitted to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allgiant Air, and asked the transport minister to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up for lobby work.
Last year, when information about this affair was first to public, Mr. Ensign excused himself with his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the fourth place in the order of the Republicans.
After he had no longer noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he wanted a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set out his investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign is happy to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls make attention to Twitter
A half a dozen of them tipped away into the crane walls in the courtroom.
In the minutes they sent their reports on grievous witness statements via Twitter.
At the end, so the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and chained children in a house that went into flames.
On Thursday, the carefully persecuted process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's pronunciation of the death judgment that the jury has spoken.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already submitted requests to the court, explaining the reasons for a procurement and which the courts will work for years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that through the intensive reporting of the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circulous atmosphere" and so widely widely widespread, promptly incremental details, so that the jury had been insufficiently influenced by public degradation.
This objection could lead the appellation courts to deal with the question whether new technologies will need new rules in the court hall.
"As I experienced during this process, I think it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the court hall influences the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Main Defense.
The chief judge, Jon C. Blue, from the Supreme Court of Chambers, briefly rejected the requests by decision last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that the report on famous-reproduced cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an eastern eopathian from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that for the new media there was a "carneval atmosphere in the court hall".
Some believe that the television series and the game movie "on the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that judicial infringements, which Mr. Hayes condemns a half centuries later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications routes from the court hall that were still unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor of the Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it will be admissible.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts could be fascinated of the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the court hall could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter matter is only one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss to years and therefore to delay a condemnation.
For example, the defendants claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel cartoons during the juror selection.
Some of the jurymen have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they would have met with awe.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutional constitutionality of the death penalty, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the lawyer, and that he would have unauthorized pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be the most interesting.
In a condemnation they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously refolded the flames of emotions over the case.
"Such a day-to-day Andrang of the media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyers wrote, "had not been experienced in New Haven before and perhaps even across the country."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news are more vibrant than reports that are being sent slower, is a technically fiendful view that impedes the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was suspended due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on shimping words and negativeness, this week has been little courtesy in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party collaboration or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not bring any breakthrough into the major issues with which the meeting was addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are taken.
After all the things you hear, it was not a courtesy discussion between two different sides, nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months causes mutual respect to dissuasive the ideological climb that continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperative and compromise willingness is demanded, while one itself tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-party war management.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are kilometers away.
Finally, the November election Washington voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the tone fall has changed," said Pete Wehner, a official representative of the Bush government, who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"It is indispensable after elections.
Choices raise partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a different choice than a solution to find."
Bush's tax reductions end the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether temporarily or permanent.
Similarly, there is a compromise on the increase in unemployment money, even though only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich are incurred, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Instituut warns that successful cooperation in urgent matters of the lame duck session must not lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112 congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps indispensable.
"After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this Skepsis is divided by many - that leads to true cooperation.
"I see much of what happens from now on to 2012 as a prefight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teaparty winners who were responsible for their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may also be that they are too high poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and to overcome the reform of health.
These parties are already made clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the increase in some taxes, the increase of the pension age and the reduction of state expenditure.
The Vice-President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own estimate, so urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan official recommendation and they fight very much to get close to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, as in financial matters, at least today, is little space or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and health system, then followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of the Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully pay attention to the public reaction.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek a compromise.
This may indeed be a optimistic vision.
Partiality and polarisation are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological climb between Obama and the Congress republicers than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure predecessor for a far far-reaching choice in 2012.
In this way, many Americans may welcome the honesty that is being taken to view this week.
But there will be much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the matters that still divorce the two.
Transmitted US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "cleptokration" and it gives a part of the coupling money and the protection fee that it collects to the Kreml. In February, the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police as well as state security services are pressing high protection money so that they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal bands.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader is walking up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a mayor of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has gained numerous offensive charges against such charges.
In September, he declared a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation suggesting that he was corrupt, "It's crazy, it's terrible, it's dirty."
> An incredible large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the ambassador report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this happens by a diploma of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to mention them as "disturbed" and to conclude that the government is rather like a cleptokrate than a government," says the Memorandum.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "cryshna" (a term from the world of the criminals / the mafia, which literally means "Dach" or protection), which extends to the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and the office of the lawyer as well as through the entire Moscow Government Office.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is on top."
"FSB, MVD and the military are at the second stage."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB is cashing from the largest companies and arresting small businessmen by the police.
One source, says, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it's best to get the protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime) because they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as asked as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed before - due to one or another predecessor.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Creml with bags that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucracy," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is indispensable.
Countrywide, so estimates Indem, the corruption Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranging to place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "most corrupted".
The disclosure of the memo of the American message, which happened after Moscow's time late evening, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the fault of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Creml to claim that the problems can be solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the detection that American diplomates called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction that is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront with the past
In a weakly illuminated, highlighted classroom with dirty and blurring walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughterer", the commander remains popular in this former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge toward the government, long-year followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it condemned the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs grew, their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For she was life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It's splitting families themselves."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were exerted or died of diseases, reworking or hunger.
When the Vietnames fell in and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military fled to Thailand at the border of Cambodia.
Here they spread up to December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, disturbance.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Vng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to go over to the government, which led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his process.
When their guards no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the crushing poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgical memory.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they put their weapons down, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the centre of justice and reconciliation, which holds all over Cambodia, even in Anlong Vang, public forums
"They are anchored in the Utopian Agricultural Ideology of the regime."
"You grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old who joined in 1974 as a teenager of Rhmer Rouge, struggled around Anlang Vang in the jungle before he left in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we need to care for ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
In the beginning of the next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before court.
The duty of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are principally responsible for the grievous acts, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to facilitate the fears of Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on The Chaem, 64 years old, who had been the district head of the Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she had told the officers of the Cambodia Documentation Center that she was conducting the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of compulsory workers probably died.
On a hot evening, Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun long shadowed on the distorted grass, the Chaem rejected to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court asked her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodja lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who flew from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would be more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodja has to dig a hole and dig the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Aconciliation with the Khmer times means merger of the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken parts together so that as everything can understand."
The Centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an annex to the history book for the High School of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Vng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are unfaithful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are getting after and after influence," he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a trailer leads overwhelmed and with plastic waste depleted way to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a roasty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a cap.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller at the border of the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go here to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last place of rest where she'll put a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to collect no further weaponable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus at Wednesday announced that the uranium that is a critical element of nuclear weapons will no longer be gathered.
The Deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years, the U.S. Government had tried to convince Belarus to collect no more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hit last spring.
However, officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements with Belarus were reached to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Natural Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April that Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit of 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear security summit (from 2012)."
"It proves that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. Government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep high-rich uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukhenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make any dirty bombs of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to remove the Uran Belarus in October was particularly complex because the material was lightly radiated, says officials.
It was loaded into a special suit, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory for, says officials.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by the official by a plane.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, while most of the money flows into Belarusian research with weak-riched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and voted in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry, working on global hazard reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-Extensive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of waffled uranium in this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its stock until 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were excited for years, mainly because of Lukashenkos' hard respect for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Belarus that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key topic in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over the Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents provided by WikiLeaks and the day newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former Vice-President of the Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish Government to be informed, "to prove that foreign aircraft overlapping Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights neglected practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was accused, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Vice-President of the Government confessed that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero on the side" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"The la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the secret service flights across the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed", not to be "unprepared surprised," reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out that the Spanish government "does not want to give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the state lawyer Vicente González gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to apply for the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Yet, the United States was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish lawyer and the German lawyers" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Defence Ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," complains Aguirre.
At an lunch in March 2007, at which the American Ambassador and Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "because the Spanish judges were wrathfully interested in their independence and did what they consider appropriate," he gave his employees an instruction to avoid "reflected rhetorical comments to eliminate the tension."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the procedure of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government Zapateros' actions could be interpreted, tolerated or deliberately ignored as possible human rights infringements, will be put into place capital, even if these detections could have a negative effect on the government of the United States," he stressed.
The child murderer says she has complained on the Internet about the "mouse" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog, "Terror in Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from young, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, you need to know their love life, which reconstructs the day newspaper ABC on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
She kept a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was of him, but his husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Shortly after that, she entered another relationship.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they divorced.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him this, he did well, but now he realizes, of course, what it means to be alone with the kid all day and not to be free, to do and to let what he want."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you the kid."
She complains, "If I don't like him to leave the kid with my mother, I'll get him off when I'm back."
In May she talks about the return to her village, "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine a work on the 20th day, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one in which he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him with someone except with my mother," a doubtful intent when considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was supposed to be murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place likes him a little bit, but on the other hand he must go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, I have less costs for the child girl."
On 17.: Reminders and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. If you see, if he wants, he finds me, such a shit."
On 30 a.m., "The boy's doing well, he's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He's putting me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had a own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner".
"Terror a la gallega (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a defended hunter, explains to have conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred from the centre of judicial prisoners to Menorca to the province prison of Palma yesterday.
The mandatory defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the course of the case, "and she did not have the intention of adding damage to the little one."
However, before she had said that César was drowned in the bath and his body was stumbled in a bag.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric advice.
Partido Popular won 4 seats at the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant growth of votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP already focuses on Parliament's elections - preferably or not, their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves at these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 Parliament elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's vote and the binding of the PP's votership - should stop, the PP's analysts predict that in Parliament's elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress members, while also CiU four (this now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the Volkspartei, the ERC would lose a member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold or win its members.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. The Volkspartei (PP) can also be the tongue on the scale to end the socialist premiereship, in four province capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the largest governments with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and the nationalists agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists do not achieve a majority or their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, where it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its share of voice in the four province capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turning. There they had ruled before the current Mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, ängel Ros, maintains good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election struggle they met several times.
In other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the people's party had a significant increase.
At present, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaida thousands of travel paces
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers of the Police Office of Barcelona's Police Office and the Nigerians were the jihadist cells controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement to Liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - last was author of the Attentate in Bombay, which demanded 106 deads in 2008.
The Spanish Minister for Interior declares these studies a major importance that goes so far that he assures that the "operation Kampai" has become the falsification device Al Qaidas worldwide "degraded" and "as well as their ability to act".
The researchers assume that during the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of roads were sent to Thailand, where they falshed and subsequently sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries unlawfully.
The discovered cell is not the only of the jihadistic network that was active in Europe, so other than the Thai investigative bodies have also contributed other European police units to research. It is not excluded that in the next days, in the area of the EU, there will be similar attacks as those carried out in Barcelona on the last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another in Thailand where the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai countries were arrested Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - has been stolen, in particular, tourist passengers in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In research circles, it is stressed that until now no connections between the arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay could be demonstrated, although the author of this Attentat was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups stolen in Spain and then false travel passports in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be reminded that a few days before the attack of Catalonia from a money transfer company had been sent several thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which ended the life of 106 people.
The police took an extensive documentation.
PP calls for a meeting of the tax agreement by Mas
The PPC Chairman, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally submit to Artur Mas their conditions for supporting his office as Prime Minister of Generalitat. These do not distinguish from those already held during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priorities of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balancing agreement which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the top of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party, with the security of Artur Mas, who granted her the 18 members who she won on the last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the civil-regional Party CiU is required that at least one of the opposition parties will be able to vote at its office.
The future allies that the regionalists want to join at the next parliamentary elections at the Congress depend on a possible entrance with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas leads at the time with the other party chiefs are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC's party chairman, it calls for the support of the entry to the office "all discourses that concern the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between State and Autonomen Region - similar to the Basque country - and which the Head of CiU even wants to undergo a referendum.
Both political leaders are meant to make the upbuilding political equipment of the regional administration slimmer and to eliminate the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the entry of Mas are addressed by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Carehouse confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Oldenheim in Olot do not rule out that their career killed over 11 older people
The officers of the old career house La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they declared the harm of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the career who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible - to the establishment.
The leader of the Old Carehouse, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for deaths), but "the right and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must take not only a social loss of sight because it has not established the career's criminal actions in time but now also pays a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime is going back on August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exaggeration of eight bodies - former patients in the old care house - as he suspected that no doctor personally studied the dead, but the formalities of their age and disease were developed by telephone.
The leader of La Caritat rejected this point round and explained that "resident measures could have been no longer the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the judicial dispute there are no individuals for irregular actions of a person other than the accused."
The one who already had been baptized as "Death Angel" before yesterday, declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different calorific agents.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the calorific cocktail used the nurse at six out of nine crimes to liberate patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will determine whether Vila lies and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he had burned it out from inside by administering blows to them as he had, according to consciousness, done with three women who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the prosecutor's statements, not even in terms of the number of resurrected murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it doesn't make sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to explain the scope of these cases of justice.
Drugs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply to the threat of the President of the ECB Trichet yesterday, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risks of Euro-Peripherial countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can fake itself and has hardly put the euro into points that cause anxiety.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market, which is recovering to the extent in which it breaks together, but due to the closing of shorter and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to undo our liquidity summits, which the ECB must take back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the termination of the plan for the purchase of government debts, as they were ineffective, and the suspension of all exceptional time-limited liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least to March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue the purchase of bonds and give a stronger signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday will be revoked, and when the neck is persistent to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Similarly, as at the ECB session in May, when the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of debt securities and to merge the markets thereafter, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she already bought a lot to provoke a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's capital administration amounted only to 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points in the entire curve and thus reflected a market perception change according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated to approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital, or these banks will be relocated.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive the parliamentary consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made its discourse with regard to the summit of Heads of State and Government moderate on December 14, where political unity is asked to show that we play the same lot together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish presidency presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Rental reform, transparency in autonomy regions such as financial institutions, degradation of state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment acquisition measures, measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons of year.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish exchange has added 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant increase in a three-year government loan that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are applying to a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our reliability.
For Spain, the application for an aid plan would be a self-offering.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The tax office has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March, the interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Yet our strategy should match the Motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the His but also the Shining."
Just courage, we can do that!
On request of his children, the Chairman of Eulen celebrates the Society meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owners of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fool.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's army, will foster the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, since he thinks it is "absolutely none". His children will try to receive a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Weinguts Bodegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not appear to be willing to submit the control of El Enebro's institutions in his judicial dispute.
He was driven from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children and appointed members of the Administrative Board at the Assembly of 18 January of this year, which was already registered in the Trade Register.
The company meeting of El Enebro, called by the judge of the Commercial Court of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new Thursday in the shot of the family Álvarez.
The call of the judge for the appointment of the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the calling of the Society meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "terrorist means of the applicants - his five children - to accept by means of legal incentives, fraudulent abuses and abuses of the unjustly declared assembly of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the contemptation of the afternoon assembly to explain it as "absolutely none".
In June, the same protagonists who were filled in discreet silence tried in no way to call in a congregation on a judicial basis.
In El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets, David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of capital.
However, the founder of the service group demands, according to family protocols, the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter which the judge has to decide on in the hearing of the contested case, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret gun of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of formula 1, its history has been characterized in this reading universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one took note of the newling and, despite his steady rise, during the last season, all at the end of the track last November, put on the victory of Ferraris by Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the ability of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "Privacy weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands and thus created a victory team became a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that brought the German company to the market in 2007 for purposes that do not deal with autorun.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid such errors and overwhelming costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on races and tests.
Russian worm suggests that in 1992, averagely ten technicians worked in the Rennstations, which could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team, 180 high-qualified young people are busy today. With powerful EDV facilities they carry out analysis and any possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred into reality by the simulator’s virtual reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that may spend a formula 1 team for its race in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a place 50 kilometers away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The employee includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources that the Energy Drink Manufacturer puts in the services of its participation on the races, further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, the Chief of Technology of the Work, emphasizes that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in the R & D sector contributed to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the shares have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that vettel and weber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty private shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) won his first exclusive store in cooperation with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty businesses with 80 to 100 square meters each, which intends to open the multi in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees with the 16 already existing sales areas in multimarket operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrro, named the reconstructed store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, which has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American company group intends to establish 200 sales sites in Europe by 2010, of which 20 establishments in Spain.
The first were invited last week in Bucharest, Romania, and Belgrade, Serbia. Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-president, who is also leader of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for loading is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry skills.
The North American company group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrro said that it is not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network is intended to "the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized companies at shopping and afterwards, even to optimize the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre of Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers, because large companies have already their service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rival in three years a million customers 'klauen'
The executive director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first, a new liquidity crisis and prophesying the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he predicts a breakdown of the interest rates that the banks are trying to compensate with increases in the fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - one still to exist.
Sabadell has found the way to survive the next three years and thus to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000, when you take off the customers that will lose the bank -. This is the great challenge this bank faces, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speech of exteriority, cost reduction. The challenges the Bank faces with this will be presented together with the annual accounting report.
Only a few banks are daring to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has interrupted all the plans of the banks worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its four years ago guide plan Optima, which was initially based on three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended for a financial year.
The customers who will leave the spare banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola, 2011 would be a "severe" year "with a large range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "creating work" - essentially for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on passives, which are punished by the interest margins, will the risks that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, be deducted to the price of loans as a compensation for diminent profit margins.
"The topics liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned off the hill, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola confessed.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase interest differences (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks were currently pursuing the Stategie "to increase fees", but "within a framework of competition."
Sabadell's guide plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
He does not at all assure that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will break in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in capita run-ups.
After assuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closing of the markets, he confirms the argument of some bankers who already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that there is nothing to turn around, but in contrast to the events in June, you can achieve short-term funding through repo businesses and thus capture the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of spare banks
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility yesterday that it could come to a merger wave of the spare banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish spare banks began, several spare banks did not participate in the first phase. They kept the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The involvement of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have twenty-seven or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organized by the Association of the Managers and Managers of Aragonien (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "exempted as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit, which was not now defined in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 spare banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 per 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the basic agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "the slowness of the process that revealed Ourism and Insaneness" was a number of unreasonable opinions, because "Banco de España urges us to finish in time before the end of the year."
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous funding systems in Europe and "possibly" in the world and added that those who doubted do this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we need not worry about the situation of financial institutions and spare banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out" as quickly as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well maintained the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have resulted in a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adjustments, starting in the case of tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of time-working companies or the lifting of the 426 Euros support for unemployment benefits, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, as well as 30% of government lottery.
On the other hand, the vice-president of the government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President of the Government Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Kanzler Angela Merkel as a responsible person who harassed the current crisis.
How can these operations be understood?
It should be assumed that the position of Merkels is not a fault of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of re-defining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of his partners.
In view of the oppositions in Europe, Germany begins to speculate over three possible results from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - even though this is currently rather according to Science Fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The thirds: a conversion of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the setting up of payments in some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position has been clear and has been declined for some time, so there are no explanations now.
First of all, 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government took a constitutional reform out of the arch to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what Germany considered necessary (streatment of tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign sets the Central European country as Merkel pushed out the decision to save Greece painfully.
At that time it was strongly criticised, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public and published opinions were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes to the new position with a clear position and calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to oblige private loan providers to carry part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, as it drives the Irish crisis and all of the following.
However, its proposal has been adopted, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that is not going to exceed it.
It says all that, even if unloved measures are to be taken now, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
In 2013, the birth year will be a new currency area in which the counterparties can be severely punished, forced to explain themselves incapable and, in this case, to take part of the costs of the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive foreign sales.
The other alternative based on debt and construction with huge holes in the payment balance, as it was indicated by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad about not understanding it.
It is not just about reducing the state deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulencies will go over in more peace.
And that we will use the possibilities that will be offered until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, to create the hypothesis, order in its own house, has prepared their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change.
Under the possibilities considered, we should not exclude the euro area fully stopped with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regular circulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to deal with a sanction.
The exclusion held by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink about whether it was an unsportable action or not and whether both players might be sancted by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (your team had already clearly won) and played several fools to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the required sanction at the next League against the Auxerre and thus go into the next game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (which in his Hymne Edelmut and Honor, and at other occasions had punished his players for similar events) played the main role in it, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, which has added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether this practice, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts are a regular turnover, which is actually consistent with the statutes of sport, but seems to handle its sense.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical insecurity of counterplayers, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the infringing players from taking an unjustified benefit from the counter team. Even that did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regular conversion, because the conversion of the rule was not executed secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as opposed as possible so that it is punished by the criminal.
The players waited down and welcomed the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the counterparties took from the deliberate fools.
Here it should be highlighted that the rivale was not brought into a more unfavourable situation or the benefits of the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, since the team could sometime also separate. In addition, the players receive a sanction with this approach and go into the second card cycle where they are excreting a card with less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear whether it is really a benefit.
Finally, such practices are not against the sports spirit, including strategic decisions to benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of regular circulation), they would rather choose when they are subject to this.
They made a strategic decision without exempting a penalty or refugeing it.
Although the limit between invention and regular environment is distorted, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics were caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provoked rules.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offensive for customer catching for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictature of the calendar will drop a lawn of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are widespread. They do not want to spend more than EUR 20 to 30.
Like the Turrón and Christmas lottery, there are also group evenings again in the pre-weight time that lead to Barcelona's oxygen of guest and leisure business. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they release a price-offensive in order to also capture the customer segment, which represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations in question.
In order to make the booking a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of 13 December with the result of a lawine of reservations from dinners at two peetakers (the 16th and 17.) and almost no orders in the previous week.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group evenings for budget reasons.
In order not to avoid this tradition, many employees pay them out of their own bag.
As the economic situation is, lowest prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona guesthouse board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Dach Association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think about it twenty times before they book."
"They like to go out, but they pay strong attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will be good for those who offer "quality at good prices with a good service", adds it, and calls us to remember that customers are saving in crisis times, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17 leads the suppliers to the collaps.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would browse. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who holds 16 hostels in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to preferred reservations even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
AN Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQuu, and a total of 23 locals, does not lose optimism since the second quarter the revenue has been bloomed and good, even if there are few days of focused views of the Christmas business.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18. will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price heat was added to the six group menus. It has the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and wish more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, green sprinkles are also seen spraying, and therefore the employees will be invited again. This means the impression that the group foods are again in the swing.
On the sides of the Fecasarm Dach Association (with associations such as the Barcelona kneep, restaurant and leisure association), the vice-president Enric Gomà trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are totally fairly "viable", although the customers "expose a maximum".
However, the fun at celebration had not gone back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons " faster than any other country".
Discoverments of Wikileyaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan Atom Program Washington.
At the edge of the clearing and soft details that the documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of the accredite North American diplomas in Islamabad reveal that the cooperation between two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but in the opposite part, and that the instable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistanic Atom Program - that the weapons are not composed, but their individual parts are stored in order to facilitate their destruction when possible - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, "The closeness of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely distribution of nuclear material and the arbitrary transport of nuclear material".
The large number of persons involved in the nuclear arsenals and the rocket programs is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia as an inherent and reason to allow caution to be governed.
"Pakistan has to set up a strong believer staff to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and cultural organisations, extremist organisations have more opportunities to relocate persons working with nuclear or rocket programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assanges' Internet portal is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan relies on nuclear dissemination and the increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frugting", declares: "There is no transparency, we will not receive any answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "as a result of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit from the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify the responsible," that "Pakistan's army has to set up its silent oversight of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol delivers a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything that is linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where the facts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "invention and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
In addition, she is not new, she comes from 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the last exploration of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
At the request of Sweden, the International Police Authority issued the order already on 20 May, but it was not notified by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after the receipt of the power.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are commanded to identify Assange and find out, "to fix and deliver it in advance."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation's statements, consider the red warning for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers, who went to publish a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
You also recall that Assange applied for the exits from Sweden and was compared with the lawyer who received the appropriate approval to the lawyer Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Head of Security of Stalin.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution," is accused of the letter.
While the world looks for him - and his mother from Australia despises the innocentness of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave the leader of the magazine Time per Skype from an unspecified place from an interview. He requested the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spionate the UN and thus have violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation as "fair and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The attempt of the Talker of the President Barack Obama to give assange less attention is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming in these days.
The Congress Chairman Peter King, who will be chaired in the National Security Committee of the House of Members from January onwards, called on the State Department to examine the possibility of setting Wikileyaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to capture their money and to pursue anyone who supports or contributes to it."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still ongoing, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "moorded".
"Obama would have to transform him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
He who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that let the government send information, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eyewitching to the Carod Nearby
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the full meeting principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe in order for the fifth time of an internal settlement in the series of the electoral ERCs after the loss of 11 members and half of the voters.
The chairman of the Party is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the neighbours of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is weakened today as its mentor itself and not will bear him the same head crushed as other former streams.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics, which would secure his position to the next local elections.
At the beginning of yesterday, the over 200 regional Council members of the ERC could express their remaining office secretly.
With electoral records, not with lifted hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a criminal sentence to the presidency, they could do this without having to fear repressalia.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod Nearby calls for more by the President than to provide his office only for the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawal, they will agree with the board with a approach plan from now to May.
They expect to contribute to the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership will present to the Council for voting on 18 April.
Their intention is to bear for Puigcercós. In contrast, it is to promise to present the congress in the autumn of 2011, what the peak of the party thinks already is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and seeks to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors for every time.
In this sense, the article that the official Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different objectives".
He counted up five of them, two of which are in the front.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to include new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should end up giving the full meeting principle as a functioning way.
In this way, he condemns a reform of the statutes which will allow the congresses to be held with selected delegates.
From the end of the full meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already struggled for it at the last two congresses, is as busy.
Indeed, at the 2008 Both Assembly, the party leadership was responsible for the review of the full meeting principle at a congress that should deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still out, since the internal rest of the past years was not ratified.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time may have arrived to resume and end this matter forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
The Chinese representative stated at the COP16 that his country has made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain his offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, insures Su Wei, the representative of this country at the COP16.
At its first public appearance on the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16) Su Wei, his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and to convert its industry.
He stated that over the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives, but would work on this matter together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that the authorities of the state in China had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving objectives, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also concluded that some multiannual plans have been adopted or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he refers to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced in the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), government and from private hands.
There is also a project at province level on climate change, another for the exchange of traditional glow bears through energy savings and another for weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than it would be assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a total of nine percent for environmental pollution.
Similarly, the energy efficiency has been increased by twenty per cent in the last five years, and another is to be done by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party chairman has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to ask for what the right confesses to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos had the right and that the former party president of the PAN has the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to ask for what the right confesses to him.
In an interview that took place before complaining Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espinos was an exclusion that had been made at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to refer to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, when his successor is elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a subject that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "does not scare us the internal competition; otherwise "we enjoy them and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best Chairman to need Acción Nacional for the next three years, and therefore he would overtake the Stafates "to those that the Council would decide."
"I'm quite free and open there. I would be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the Chairman of the Party."
He anticipated that the party's last elections of 4 July will reflect in the next elections, although "this is not the time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting the governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments produced from Allians between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flags and be watched throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his disc course in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to consider over the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the lock," he confirmed.
He believes that the holder of the federal government would express expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in that country there was no mouth ban and less a censur.
Obama is in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twisted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the countrywide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on the Legalisation of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the Social Network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," said Obama.
Its brief communication contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls for the public to come into contact with its senators, since the vote of the law is direct.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was distributed after the 42 republikan senators and moved to block all the voices for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republikan senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the dissemination of nuclear weapons.
About the blockade of the Republicans of the Law of Dream Act and other projects, the presidential speaker Robert Gibbs said that if the tax theme was resolved, he would be able to set up a schedule for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be addressed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
On Tuesday, the Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students can be voted in the Senate from the coming Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act Act or the American dream law would legalise about 800 000 young people who emigrated into the United States when they were not sixteen years old during the last five years in this country and have been legalized at a higher educational institution or at the army.
However, the presidencies of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, so they are dependent on the voices of a handful of Republicaners. At present, the organisations of the prosecutors of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the Defenders of the Dream Act have to get several Republicans on their side if other democrats should decide to return to the initiative.
Among the most dominant Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snow and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of the Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it at another opportunity.
Another Republican who spoke for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has a different version, the Analytics agree with it that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lngua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish language literature and used the subtitles of her question at this time (on another event the round was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "does bring us into trouble," the Argentine scripture sweetened the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who gathered together at the International Book Meeting in Guadalajara (FIL), to attend this Marisol Shultz-made round table, which took part in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela presented a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz afterwards marked as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is to learn what is a "worn" and goes from a doctor to a doctor from whom she receives no answer, but suggestions for the guide of her story.
Infectologists convinced her, "It's not my strength to be patient, perhaps it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who robbed her at the middle of the walk, but who explains her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytist reveals the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the nail."
The main figure of the story sucks and concludes that "the wound only learned that it was really open and not exist." But it is convinced that the desire for the language and their falls is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story that he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
He tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far traveling men or restored the dying lost by a girl. The story made a turning and reported of America, the great Roman, who from the beginning did not lack his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillao, who criticizes the overflow of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spooked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise, the history of America would never have been told - with impressions that even came away with the shame."
However, he emphasizes that "the crazy and liars are the best to imagine the things" and there is approaching reality and lie to each other, where one no longer knows to which side the story belongs, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls that the "Tradition Cervantes".
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of the interpretations to which the FIl's invitation had contributed to the round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and the Puerto Riconians devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence, which affects their country, like Latin America, as a result of the fights on drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained, after having highlighted that literature is communication and binding that builds between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-life world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out of dogmatism, and he will forget, "that behind every confirmation is a little no, and behind every denial is a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nowancate: And nuancations often mean to put the finger in the wound and to disturb those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the mighty ones who prefer to split the world into black and white he noticed and invited to rediscover a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back to three defeat in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
The duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game also represents two different styles of their respective trainers, and their contradictory meetings reflect in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back to three defeat in final games, he has experienced ups and abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been well held, why this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinian has played up with the Medaille to the second champion, he has left a step behind the winners, and it is surprisingly he has carried out final games with the same team.
The Sanist Stratege reached the first end game as trainer at the 'Turneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the wings in hand with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', when they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a backtrace again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went unequivocally after 210 games, but at the 11 meters he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but at last three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore he would not again want to be persecuted from the accident and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give me, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the taxer commented when asked him about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strong in the memory of him, he assures him to have learned a lot of it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the judge does not peep the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a doctrine until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by 11 metres shooting, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at 11 metres shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or intense efforts to keep the title in the hands that left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not come to it."
It is in Romanso power not to be just a second champion and for the first time to cost the praise that the titles bring.
The United States changes the rules for the receipt of a visa
Persons must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulat at the Services Offices for Visum Application; costs will be reduced in this way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are changed in the United States' message and in the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulat at the Visum Application Services (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC records the biometric data of the applicant, which is reviewed by the Consulat before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the settlement of the visa are lower, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa request and the transport service with which the document is handed.
The applicant provides only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa with request (including visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulat, they only have to imagine at the next ASC, where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the 26 dollar service.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
The NASA announces the fund of life outside the earth
The North American Space Agency called on a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for life in all.
The U.S. National Air and Space Authority (NASA) gives a astrobiological discovery known tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of exterior life.
The foundation will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When calling the press conference, the NASA assured that it would present "a prudent foundation for looking for outerland life", which resulted in speculation for experts from other countries.
Discovery could prove the theory that in enemy environments that have been considered unavailable so far, humanlike creatures can exist. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent lives - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems that it is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered to be too toxic for all of the thoughtful forms of life, since the lake is strongly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsenal as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are increased that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
If these organisms change the arsenal, according to the astrobiologists, it has been demonstrated that "a real life form, a second life form, which is different from the known ones."
At the press conference, the Space Agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, the real scope of its fund.
At the conference, the Geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who explore the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study the titanium (the largest moon of Saturn) in question whether his chemical composition of the earth is similar.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the Organ Law on the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th period of law had just started, and already an opposition block was installed, chaired by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as an independent one. The four raised the following: the entry of the 'twee-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the opening session in the 60th period of law, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo vagued against the reform of the Organ Law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, they would introduce a 'two-party system', because now there were two people, the same number as parties that control the congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, which was chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had introduced their political interference institutionally with these reforms.
He stated that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the schedule, and they went out of the political will and if they weren't, they would return unfairly from both parties, which would end the opposition coalition.
"I come here (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, who do not even consider taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia explained that there was a match with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would therefore be a pluralist group.
It cannot be approved, he continued that the congress, after being monopolist, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that the Congress is to rule an eternal two-party system."
"From the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they talk to other colleagues in order to become more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT showed to PAN and PRI that the congress has now turned into a 'output' for two.
"From the time it was only one party, now they divide this to twot."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their seat to the negotiations.
"The five who are probably nine Members must not be left outside because of the top decisions of five which are likely to be nine. The five who are currently seen as divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because he has been reformed by the others, we have stayed outside and we are not in agreement with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The city management of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over some 200 000 peso for the benefit of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year is 1,200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city management, this check issued to a amount of 200.144,56 Peso was issued with 9258447 on last 16 November with the purpose of the "recovery of open invoices".
The treasure champion Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at above prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that is still guilty of her and consequently the number of cheques that are still exposed to the benefit of Camacho Palazuelos.
"There was nothing bought with her, it's just paid the debts, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "dust" in the last quarter of the year "more on": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as this is legally required when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid requesting other administrations for their services, the treasure champion assured that its services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the review of the checks issued by the city manager to his suppliers, it was known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year official of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they added checks to the value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad state of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the crash of a foreign tourist in the invasion of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada trade association, reminded that for different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and walking routes would have been negative, since the tourists would be able to climb and see the disorder, and then they would turn back to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the storm of the tourist would have made attention to the lack of prevention and remaining maintenance work on the sides of the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid that happens again. How to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afterhand," he explained.
"We are waiting for a clean city, because not only because it is a tourism area, it must be maintained, also we inhabitants have a right to a clean living room. The city management must change their strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that look unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleanses their beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions keep constantly shot," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents just make what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgent."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to front man together with the city. It should be priority to make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places that should first be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and add them to the inventory with which we are advertising for this destination.
IP requests results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements, between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is inclined and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was invited. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. This is a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, feel obliged to the society and to the various social groups that are dependent on parliamentary work and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partiality and patronism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs, suggested that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act free from agreements between the parties, because it is usual that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, to transform themselves into Karnevalscomparses of the Governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care of that they carry out a trustworthy work and put themselves in front of all things for society and their groups, because it were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them at the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complex.
"The most important thing is that they encourage economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked by the new Members to allocate the value necessary in the public budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-fivest funds, which is inconsistent with an important economic activity that brings exchanges and investment into the country and is in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
Tourist projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law which has not been revised during previous legislative periods must be updated.
Holy King Is Searched
Pups, cars, bicycles and other toys want the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family desirable.
For parents, it will be difficult for the next three-canning day to meet these wishes, because the household is no more and not less than 12 people and a goat bock.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes that they so deserve.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes it's hard times because my husband has no job. But we're selling mandarins and potatoes... I'm going to go with the makers to sell the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes a barbie pope.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time, and for whose eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothing in the size of one year.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I replied to him, 'Let us wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaias has the size 10, during the eight-year-old Miguel Size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realise the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Healish King will be searched' by spending a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 Drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house reviews in the Estrie administrative region were carried out.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will be charged with different charges.
House searches were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, which were intended to serve mostly by drug production.
"At around 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the Quebec Security Police.
Overall, 11 men and three women were arrested, of which two of the men, who are considered the main tractor of the drug ring, came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest before the judicial building.
They could be accused, among other things, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, whose property for sale purposes, the complot and the service of crime.
These house examinations had been carried out as a result of a long-term research activity that went for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Police Authority Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships charged with domestic immigrants, will be inclined in all the prospects after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I reject this Charter with emphasis."
"I hold with a party who put you to the feet," explained Michael Ignativf, Head of Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session was ended before the assembled members.
The liberals argued that the draft law, which allows to hold any person identified for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to one year, is injured, as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Legal and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law, since he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government does," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has declined the critics from the hand that demands that their party did not act steadyly enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to carry out this through the mediation of another draft law, C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the conservatives because he seeks the debt of the refugees and keeps children caught for at least one year," said Chow.
Minister for Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with politics and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are promptly informing the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal operations that affect Canada and treat the country as a footbreaker."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," says the reaction of Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservator said to the Agency QMI that the government would call up a voting authority so that each opposing member will immediately explain to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion from Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister for Public Safety, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Inquisition on this subject last January.
The metropole has been a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than just one surprise.
It is necessary to say that, despite Robert Dutils' presence, this measure was not at the least discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Party Québécois, qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "shoulded of the hat" as as well as "on a twin-adjusted solution".
Minister Dutil had again turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionnaire, future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he pleased to confirm.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists to prevent the education of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, Doctor for Ethics and Political Systems at ENA (the State University for Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he suggests that Quebec grants a special mandate for financial auditing so that such investigations can be carried out on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the verification," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to the statement.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.
The Quebec will also require by Ottawa to change the criminal law in order to be better addressed to this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the state lawyer of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that judicial proceedings in this kind of criminal persecution are not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister for Public Safety, confirmed his colleague of justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently seized with certain novellations related to this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which took the groups of the motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelled.
Thus, Ottawa has implemented the law against gangsterism.
Flowers under strict monitoring
Several rivers continue to be under strict monitoring due to the high precipitations that have been expensive since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in Maurice's administrative region, it came to a Erdrutsch on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another Erdrutsch was in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudier administration region.
A street has been swallowed together.
From Tuesday on Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres have been defeated to several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected to be in line with the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain showers.
Since it is still to add to these rainfall the snow melt that has already been collected in certain parts of the region, the arrival of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service called warnings about the high water alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the object of the overwater monitoring and will continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the violent precipitation of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-compartments as well as in Rawdon has led.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was discontinued due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the Mansfield-et-Pontefract municipality.
The security service continues to be alert and monitors the situation, according to the Security Council, Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially by Machineongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont declared partly
The Quebec Rundfunk Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial backslag before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as on its outstanding speech on radio.
The CCNR represents the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to their own opinions, but certain statements would have "inappropriate information on the social care and injustice of negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unsuccessful speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasting."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments issued during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first provision was made due to a complaint from the "Front commun of the person assistées socials du Québec".
The Activity Organisation had complained that the amounts referred to in the consignment were inappropriate.
The Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont held that suicide was an expression of humility.
The majority of the members of the Board of Supervisors had concluded that the communicated message was that suicide could not be regarded as a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board take into account that the implications of the "Dupont le midi" mission would have been sensitive in a family-righted and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not provoked with any tadel against his person.
The last issue concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this respect that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator had declared not to have donated for the benefit of Haiti's help, as you were not sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not misuseful, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already broken my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My act has been virgin for one and a half years," explained the moderator.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors prangizes the dissemination of an unhealthy expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "onside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which had to communicate its decisions once during the main end period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddin Zemmal, Montreal's algeric origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete that brills in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, now grows in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and to the box rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmel, who has been in the metropole since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I am personally looking for the battle in many places, since those who present the soil struggle, like the mixed fight arts, are not liked, competitions in North America are rar."
Recently, his character as a security officer, as well as the UPS company, had made bad news to his rival, in which he received two gold medals from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) between the 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, the world championship of the Amateurs.
"I have achieved the victory in the categories of full contact with Kickboxen and the Thai Box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the world pole in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters invited from each category who had been placed among the first four at the last world championship."
"I babe in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I got back in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I became a third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines that come from China, in which feasts and footsteps are allowed as well as soil throws.
The two fights usually play on a platform, more rarely in a box ring.
The most renowned box struggler, which has come from this kind of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, who is probably known in the world of battle arts.
If Nacer once kept a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," explained the sympathic poundmaker.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the stadium of Lumpinee (the largest stage of Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Sometimes in the half-final of his category (80kg) he had won his first battle before then he lost in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four struggles per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the head to crown a single champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved 450 million dollars in contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Rupert in mutual agreement.
In the middle of this law of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the main share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was trained in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to overcome its responsibility to overcome this important hydroelectric project at a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" completed the lucrative contract without a public procurement.
For the party Québécois, the withdrawal of business consortia represents a serious ethical problem that disturbs the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a carded game and detects competition."
"That means that you are now conducting in open form instead of carded games rather than in secret ways," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, MEP, at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be used in this way.
Minister for Resources Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this afternoon by giving her invokation to the fact that it would have been a carded game in this contract.
"I remain faithful to my line," she whirled by strengthening that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and it "feel her hard."
She said it "be the minimum," that the PQ excuses himself.
The model of the consortium is globally common practice.
It is usually a temporary covenant that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in relation to a command on a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity regarding its workout.
The construction procedure is in progress and is to be established by 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even in relatively simple projects.
As the "Le Devoir" newspaper said last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of engineering and consultancy is subject to government investigations.
A short survival of the Quebec Company Register allows the name of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, the company Dezeu works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozens of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely theseu.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special dynamic workforce and that hydro-Québec has taken this fact in particular since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has made the nose about the fact that the contract on project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only few applicants, your prices will speed up."
"You have two ways: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the persons," confirmed Laporte.
This contract approved to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts received over 50,000 from the party Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the "Le Devoir" newspaper included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were granted between 2002 and March 2010 by companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totally amount to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had called that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "financing" before she precised that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but conceived skeptical.
The Quebec Consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but as little as the marked brands or eco labels to control his choice.
Injury, although it baths in a media-effective universe, where it is so violent from information for the benefit of a more responsible consumption: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called socially-compliant products in 2010, the Quebecers seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that in fact, to give little faith to the environmental commitment of the companies as well as to the green business advertising, the measuring instrument evident by the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official, supposedly fair products attached, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, is the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously from only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently living by only a third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful nature of the information stumbled the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer according to the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebec's claimed performance of the green products and services which they are endeavored to use is mistrusted.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases in dealers of their city district and favored the purchase of foods cultivated in their region.
Green and responsible conscious - the index of environmental conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who is trying to reduce its trails left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to hold before his car, such as the barometer: just once 28% of the Quebecers have stated that they have used public transport in 2010 or have preferential to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The supply and bicycles were also supported by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioural survey, which eats the clinical performances.
State loans for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of the Kinocomplex of Daniel Langlois, eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to overcome this back to his actual Chinese function, seems not to receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted the involvement of this matter, but under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan in less than the initially expected amount, which could cause a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least according to the sources of public rumours.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the bite search has been corrected down again since the sum.
A proposal, together with an action plan, was already sent by the President of the Société de développement of the entreprise culturallles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, which is directing the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he had sent her a last report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the state donation seem to have been really pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership of the cinema and cinema complex had rejected against a direct government investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not also have to be able to access other cinema.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained, in contrast, of substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author kino in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exemption from the State Bank for over ten years after the self-financing construction of the cinema.
The lack of cinema, which shows independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, run a privately financed campaign from which they hope a sum of $700.000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not cancel the "Le Devoir" newspaper and was ignored what he and his group hold from the corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of the complexly shaken Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat lines spread by WikiLeaks revealed the secret of what the United Nations consider under the Canadian minority complex, but with the same stroke they open the superiority feeling to Canada.
As a result, the American diplomas are surprised that the Canadian voters do not have the Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Conservative Government to carry out their 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pikant details than the only material content to which you have to knack.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full, reports the United Nations no longer participate in the actions discussed by their political bosses.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"The Canadians may have a closely inhabited minority complex that may lead the Canadian political leaders much more to talk about the internal issues of everyday life than to the United States to the black Peter in this election (such as 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, are, therefore, "the spokesworthy Goliat of this election: unprecedented, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "aur-depressing silence" less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party manager to conduct such essential relationship that the elector has as a key factor in the pursuit."
The other expression of this sensation of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, which President Barack Obama has to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government remains in the confidence voting about the Federal Budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than one decade, which has resulted from a lifetime programme of $30 to $40 billion," says Breese.
He had never mentioned that the government had had to lose Parliament's session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being interrupted by the coalition and the so-called continued existence of opposition parties to affect the quality of the proposed life programme.
Another communication, dated in January 2008, and by the Ambassador Wilkin's communication, Washington is aware of the increasingly negative image that the CBC-rays spread dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about shipments such as borders, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle plays to Maher Arar, which "No-Fly List" or also abductions for the purpose of abductions carried out by the CIA muscle process.
Another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten, with her French colleague Bernard Kouchner, asked for the first bilateral meeting, has asked if Europe is ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of a individual case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he sent to the State Secretary a paper in Puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the act again."
Finally, let us note that the spectators are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "ommed".
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which is nearly a third of the additional reduction, which needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that hope to implement the UN in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of forced reduction obligations in industrial countries.
After the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered to the earth, if the white-glowed bears, which are still a monopol of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, with light diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fluorescent park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the major emissions centres such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, 5 Gt should be deducted to stabilise the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from excessive control.
In the white glowing bears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bears, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bears you will once again reduce this energy demand by two times.
The compact fluorescent bears hold the average between 6000 and 100,000 hours.
The new LED bears, such as those that the manufacturer Philips placed on the market this week - this society has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-glowing bear, which means a breathing of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan, which is intended to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that these completely new glow bears only give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bears have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore must be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except that producers provide an acceptance point.
The main source of quacksilver emissions on the planet, however, is not the compact fluorescent bears, but the coal power plants that expel much more mer kvicksilver to produce the electricity wasted by the white glowing bears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants eliminate 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report explains detailed the profits that each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 carbon power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory coast expects exciting the announcement of the results of the elections
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "inappropriate" publication of the results of the presidential election of the ivory coast directly after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral Commission to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UNO-Chef.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the ivory coast to prove their responsibility and to hold each initiative until the proclamation of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the electoral Commission had released the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, but CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alasane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo-Lager calculates with the cancellation of "fraudful" voting duties in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the forces nuvelles (FN) during the failure in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Championship of the Ivory Coast, confirmed that the UN's practiced manöver to intimidate the electorates in the north of the country had absurd the President's attendants to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who dismisses any connection to the ex-rebells, has assessed the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to call on the victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows that he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission has been prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the ivory politicians of the ivory coast that they could be held responsible in the event of any excursion.
Laurent Gbagbo had enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes compared to the 32% for Alasane Ouattara, who had benefited from the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rates in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropole on stable 9.3% (with the involvement of overseas departments of 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Ministry of the Federal Sea.
The unemployment rate in the metropole is 2.631 million.
The data from the second quarter were 9.3% of the employable population in the metropole and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, unemployment rates reported an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million employees were not busy, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to use every two weeks or not or not or whether they were job seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropole (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the youths aged between 15 and 24 years were unemployed according to the IAA.
The seniors, on their own, have a slight increase in unemployment rates of 6.4% in the metropole (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% in the overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insea has no longer published the monthly unemployment numbers since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
On behalf of Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was submitted to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged for the destruction of social resources, the distortion of general goods, healing, interference in corruption, unauthorized coupling and arms possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is ready to fight and is planning to express himself on all questions that will ask him the lawyer instead of spreading brain pens."
"It is easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove it," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialist) in the departement, had put the value to give the judge a memorial to his justification before he was consulted by his lawyers.
A family of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than his deposit he had to run.
With regard to the business competence area or the target of the associated fund, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this Affaire, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday because of detention and complication, but then under the obligation to retain, under judicial supervision, from the protagonists of these acts, on a free foot.
"My Mandant was able to deliver explanations about the facts that were proposed to him."
"The executive lawyer has taken into account not to rob him his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons were charged and released from prison in the evening of Tuesday on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, says the vice-president of the state lawyer Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, vice-president of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is legally persecuted due to "unauthorized influence and passive coupling".
Two officials of the Aubagne Ballation Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "The intertraction and distortion of general goods by a public service officer", the other on the basis of "contamination of public funds".
The companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and destruction of society".
One of the persons represented by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar affaire of fraudulent forms of publicity that had affected Corsica.
The flags suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for countervailing fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, is carried out in April 2009 due to anonymous writings in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
Nearly research sources show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as to certain cities of the Marseille city intake.
Affaire Clotilde Reis: the Elysée Palast exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "Spionage", the French public in breath, put the diploma into alarm willingness and accustomed to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attentionful views of the United States diplomas.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and the "Le Monde" newspaper offer some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, which went to the extent to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officers tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and the American justice due to trade in material for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reis, in a grey light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this respect.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée Consultant in Strategy issues, interviewed Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle Orient with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They advised the Americans to put everything in place to return their own nationals who would be violent in Iran.
"May noise," they said, "articulated loudly and clearly and without submission" the words "Grundmen's Rights", "Unschuld", "sofort release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into embarrassment, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "Silver silence doesn't solve anything", beyond the discussion attempts on inconceivable ways, the Iranians are "Mistress in Departure Manöver".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "familiar, Iranian tactics" "gissing for political expression".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reis from prison (which should come to the prison on August 16, on the day when it flies into the French message) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit).
And he makes it acceptable that the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that will "suppress."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reis has been released from prison twelve days ago, but it continues to be held in Iran.
An information was brought into circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery demands the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
As many other observers, the American message is questioning about this alarming coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow deal?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
In the event of a reconciliation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fullly surprised by the judge's decision", but also attempted to reject it.
"There has been a regenerative exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judgment decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "strenger" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, resigns, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "belongs at the moment to the buildings that the Iranian message is directed in Paris".
During the conservation of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée does not make his efforts to make a "refugee attempt" by admissions and by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruits, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from 25 August 2009 contempts the "medium flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thankfulness" to Mr Assad, the Paris message is questioned.
"Despite their explanations of praise, the French authorities confess that they have only a vain idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée has brought to abolish this fiction.
Intensive communication efforts "is aimed at confirming Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which then "was considered premature and unpaid by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian Role Constructing" in Paris, "Syria seeks to look at what rewards can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also aimed at "saing between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier had confided her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians had done anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least stipulate confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "the ashbrödel", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by locking them access, so indicated government managers.
A draft law that will call on online games operators to dismiss young people under 16 years of midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, depicted representatives of Cultural and Family Ministry.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning at school and also with leading a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and right to sleep," explained Jo Rin, with this draft law, responsible for Ministerial Agent of the French Press Agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturers had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he precised.
The government is also concerned to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit given for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it added the responsible.
He will also provide free programs for those who want to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers report regularly on various, intensive Internet use-related events.
The country is also unconfronted champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had acquired four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the land of autumn
In excitement due to corruption suspicion, the FIFA Executive Committee appointed the World Championship Countries 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA Kingsdiscipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to continue to pursue new territories (Katar, Australia) for himself, after the Premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities associated with the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Sokrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the makeups behind the cults threatened to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was held at the beginning of the exploration of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, weighing of the football, which could only take out the world championship once, namely 1966.
The BBC had given it again on Monday by putting out a documentary report, which took three impressive members of the Committee: Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to angry the FIFA and to embarrass the English officers, who had first and foremost performed an intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government is hoping for a new edition of the chess train successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 achieved the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less secure, since the Duo Spain Portugal does not lack tramps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shade sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The potential repressalies against the English countries and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal make Russia’s opportunities growing, despite its gaps in the file (Stadies, Hotels, Transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to call on the unwounded spirit of the objections of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" from the members of the Committee.
"You're assassinating them with a fool, you're trying to compromise them," poeted Putin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorites, strengthened by the experience of 1994.
The first economic world power, the headsponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to show a long list of advantages toward Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries who had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the confession of the WM 2026 for China, which is deprived of the Asian Chances at 2022.
With Australia and Catherine, which had taken all registers with the observance of Futurist Stadiums, the FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia may, as well as Japan and South Korea, suffer the sensitive nerve of the FIFA, under the weaknesses of television rights (through time shift).
Second mandate: publicity
The Gaulle had really studied.
Mitterand would have believed that he was stumbled.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the lowest patience.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well faced with the side of the mystery that arrests the presidential function.
So you've got to do that as if the doubt is going on.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the adherers Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believe in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in a serious tone insured to take his decision "in the autumn of 2011".
Thus, the fact that he would give the view of "two mandates" in the Elysée on the Tuesday night before the UMP parliamentaries had a little feverity.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President just reminded that the 2008 Constitutional Change limits the number of five-year officials to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he mentioned the presidential election at the time of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have mostly seven and a half years with me, or best with me," he explained them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010, "Don't believe I don't think about the stage afterwards."
His words from yesterday do not make him a candidate more than in the past, but not less.
If they should make comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal, who moves Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, who urge many members of the PS earlyer than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," reacted immediately and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin notifies.
"He will always believe in the victory," corrects Alain Juppé, who has discovered himself with publicity.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government documents
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should offer an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures in the monetary policy that will come to their conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt requires the central bank in Frankfurt no doubt to confuse the current more than stressed situation on the European borrowing markets in order not to eliminate their deterioration.
The political costs of this would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in the resolution of European government budget debt yesterday at a press conference.
She did not dare to say whether she believes that the central bank could do more, for example by encouraging its programme of purchase of State bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trade partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the previous day, when he was consulted by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, was not very speaking about its projects, but reassured to note that the programme of purchases of public documents on the secondary market would "extended" and that we will see "as the decisions will take place" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will be left unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s treasure Board’s bond purchases were doubled to around EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to some traders' discretions, she should have made new purchases in Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Totally, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The anticipation of a follow-up of the purchasing course is no doubt among the dealers (see page 29).
The people are already expecting no remarkable change in courses.
If the loan transactions of more than three months are already disappeared from the ECB's Arsenal, the latter will still create the unlimited funding reserves in a free manner, over a period of one week to three months.
The peoples are already concerned today that this measure will continue to extend for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme substantially."
"In other words, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in a short way," says Michael Schubert, the peopleswirt of the Commerce Bank.
"A progressive outturn for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipated on his side Norbert Board, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the market of government debt, "the ECB would maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that lives on the carrying market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the European banks’ exposed position on the markets of government debt in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must be put on the market at any price to the employees of the lacking investors and act like this in order to prevent the rapid enthusiasm of the earnings paid to the weakest countries," said yesterday, an important obligation holder.
Because if interest rates were applied to a high-level flight, the countries would be more obliged to reduce or just stabilise their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi Government is in Italy
After an alarming start of the week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decline of the angle interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the President-in-Office of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "unpredictable" and heard it with an "unpredictable" weekend, which the subject immediately denoted.
In any case on Tuesday, the volume of the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk were increased to 263 points, which resulted in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates is 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as a "tough concern" of the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In the Klarxt, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, swindy tax revenue that threaten the State to no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Recently, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although this budget is estimated to be 1.3% or 2% in the Senate.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the restoration for a new budget collective that could be used to a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"When necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says economic auditor Olli Rehn.
In the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are okay and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time," insurs Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustors of the International Monetary Fund, which is responsible for Italy at the IWF.
"In the moment, there are no problems, neither on short-term nor on long-term perspective, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) there is a demand for lower stabilisation progress than from other countries," Pier Carlo Padoan, the head of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a mistrust request from the Chamber of Members, which would allow the electoral elections to be organised at the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think of the expansion of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had stressed it in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon as well as on the evening: Europeans are clearly together, ready and engaged to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although perfectly relatively - yesterday's decline in the interest feet of European government bonds was water on the walls of governments and the ECB.
However, from a normalisation start, it cannot be spoken yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target disc of speculants today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly loaded on banking systems," says the opinion of the Exane GDP Paribas peoples.
In particular, "the political time goes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this climb and the danger that is in it, intensify the discussions on strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected financial ministers and in further sense with their congresses of the G20 go well forward.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin in the beginning of the next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan, the loss of unconventional measures to reinforce the euro area countries in the cross-border of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares it for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first recruitment expenditure is intended for the next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Agency Reuters had trusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional direct involvement of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the first countries, are asking themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of the labour market organisation.
Reforms, which will be added to the savings measures, but should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid do another way than Greece and Ireland did.
Both the one, and the other, to avoid at any price the need to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms which will bring them back to their confidence.
In turn, European investors are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of State bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the door trip in Paris on 24 November, had first produced the idea that if the 750 euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back on his own bag.
The nationals of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market in European government debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "predominantly" in the form of a direct liquidity prize.
This fund exists: the European mechanism of numbered financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
A advisory board that has all the chances to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are at stake.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departements in Alarm Level Orange
Snow episodes still impede transport difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Four and twenty departements are now in alarm level orange due to the threatening snow and glazing risk.
The regions of yours, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in the alarm level of Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow viewers tangulate the north of the Gironde and the charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departements concerned, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to impair certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are locked for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who refuse to use their own vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER-road buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers for maximum caution on the roads and for the appropriate adaptation of their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged the airlines to strike 25% of their flights from the Paris airport Roissy on Thursday and 10% of the flights from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: First Financial Skizzes
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France is in full, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular the 23 billion of the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the paths, the State has called for a capital deposit of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical form, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant a part of the financial sum to its twofold on the markets.
Today it has finally come to the first settlement.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning, under review by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures planned to bring up the first part of these funds.
This is two measures: the creation of a special tax on the settlement and higher taxation of the offices at Ile-de France.
First of all, Article 15 of the draft law is taken from the Société du Grand Paris public law agency.
This is decisive: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Secondly, a new order of existing company taxation is: "to modernize them to increase the product of its performance and to overcome this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not quoted in the text.
From the 4 billion one is far away.
"It is said that the tax resources are calculated to be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation, which the State is charged and the Société du Grand Paris is regularly provided for the project," the explanatory statement is to be taken.
The SGP does not find this system violent at all.
"At the moment of booking revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then create out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will begin to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions will be able to look for for a long time, is at risk of bringing up a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsick hacker and emsige spiones
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On the one hand, she has disappeared as a obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of shine health that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go on the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any act (an x-any nation) created by a secret service consists exclusively of newspapers.
The "extraordinary", American explorations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what was read over months as well as in any X-any journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the terrible caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists for a long time for their sketch.
The rule that the secret dossiers can only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherian publications, you will be aware that every work (over the Gral, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rose Crosslers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occultural texts does not want to publish research (now he did not know where to find news about the non-existing) but because those who devote to occultism in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or restricted mind) is also the chief of the secret service (or otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American message in Rome to the State Desert, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a revocation made about the detection of these dossiers?
On the one hand, these say what every trained person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, turned into spionage centres.
Everybody who looks at inventory films knows this very precisely, and it does not happen from punishment that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly hurts the task of shine health and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-like hacker can handle the secrets of the most powerful country of the world is a major struggle against the presidency of the State Desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less of the victims than the "sharefriends" in distress.
But we dedicate the deep nature of what happened.
At Orwell's times, you could bundle all the powers like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been able to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, every transaction performed, the visited hotel, the selected motorway, and so on; the citizens would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if you see what happens today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process stops to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen's vengeance - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels in essence is a secret free of Secretis, since it awards the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been added to such a powerful power?
It is evident that in the future, the states will not put any pre-reserved information on-line - that would be similar to an outhang attached to the road corners.
But it is also obvious that it is forgiven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State has moved on in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only certain ears be held in the future?
I know very well that my prediction is currently sounding after science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to imagine the governmentsagents, in a secret manner moving emigrating on uncontrollable march routes, their communications nowhere different than in the only memory, and in addition to the few written information they have received, in the shoe set of shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: in principle, the spionage attempt of Watergate had to note less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogue) video tapes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by rearwarding and raising all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today do not allow anything but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, you travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it requires three and a half hours by a plane including the turning.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policies and communications technology come back to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand the secrets of the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: like France its financial promises beautifully spoken
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved funding promises (also called "Fast Start" or early funding) that have been implemented by the developing countries.
And the grey French beauty are already discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to deliver 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the time of opening the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitments to the fast-start funding: the detailed approach report of its Member States, press conference, large additional events, the distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and estimated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society are pleased to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which it brings on the right way to respecting its commitments of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" according to the Copenhagen Treaty in order to ensure that additional use has been made without sufficiently disadvantaged by public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the direction value he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has set itself as a guide for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be allocated for over three years in the context of the financing of fast-start.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In contrast, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total total of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decline) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are € 1 borrowed as equivalent with € 1 donated.
Obviously, this is only difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments ( often related to emission reductions based on most efficient technology), it is fraudible to present the euro that is used as equivalent to a euro paid... In addition, only the costs of the loan should be considered as a commitment to the capital donor (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
However, France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million) and spend 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the EU's only country that is largely investing loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) meet their commitments to 100% with donations.
Otherwise, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understands a similar use among them.
Beautiful Hokuspocus!
Everything in all, France operates in its fast-start funding with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time, and the other part with the reality of financial use.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with his promise, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrages) could lead to a double negative effect; once the EU-intern (what are the other Member States going on with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not have to be completely fake...
The chapter of early funding is only a small question on a relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machine of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and comparative justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the object of long-term funding (a different, decisive and currently discussed issue): the question of the "reliability" or the type of booking of his loans is not addressed.
France could change his position in order to be as progressive as to the issues of disputes as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of the "reliability" and the use of loans would of nature raise from the international trust basis, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes on the day 81 different chemicals, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (early movement to protect the rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that their results "as a result of the small number of analysed samples do not represent a statistically significant value, but Illustration characteristics of the treated problematic," between July and September, had bought food consumed within four, approximately ten years of age at the meals, and an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as nasery of laboratories in the search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or likely cancer-sensitive and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine distortion factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"If in the nearer overall of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very good, however, that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer stimulants or substances with endocrinine distortion is exciting," the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancer-resistant residues and three safely demonstrated as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim meal time for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a ban on fungicide in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tune fish from the bulbs, even the baguette and the chew rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were spucked.
In the management water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At dinner, the lax steak was 34 chemical residues determined at the "richest" and even the plastics used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "injury cocktail" for consumers is "likely underestimated", says the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed, in view of the urgency of the situation, to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the increase in civilisation diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
