Politicians in Wales fear "like fools"
Some members of the Walisian National Assembly were afraid of a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Walisian Parliament).
AM's from the whole political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could cause ridiculties.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was worried because "the rim on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: On walisian means twp fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A whale-conservative said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context the walisian letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is expressed in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently composed of a legislative proposal on the introduction of the change in names, said: "The final decision on appointments that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Walisian National Assembly power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which were widely supported by calling the Assembly a Wallic Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission prefers Welsh Parliament members (Walish Parliament Members) or WMPs, but the MWP option was the greatest support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve agreement can prove difficult for the Chairman of the Assembly, Elin Jones, which is expected to compile a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms contains other changes in the way the assembly is working, including rules on discwalification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is debated.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The voters vote Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote will be held in an attempt to solve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has their own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour is a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will undertake the vote.
Followers of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The Clocks of St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches in Harlem are fighting
"The older people I've spoken with said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's no part."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways now in days," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the everyday rooms of the quarter where people go in on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money collected to sell assets does not last long, and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are filled with the kind of people who do not help the quarter's returning places.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownerial apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the top of a boycot of shops at 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when father Johnson’s family children planned to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, called the pride bell game "the poor bells".
The expert who played on the watch game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a incomprehensible historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been done in St. Martin's over the last few months, has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them collected by the leaders of the church, others of the Bishop.
In July, the Council of Ministers — the leadership of the congregation, composed of leading physicians — wrote to the bishop's judgment of concerns that the bishops would "will try to push the expenses on" to the Council of the congregation, even though the Council of Congregation had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs sent to the Bishops.
Some of the congregation members complained about lack of transparency from the side of the Bishop.
Haj hurts 13-year-old on diving tour after lobsters in California
A hail attacked and hurt Saturday a 13-year-old boy when he diving after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy shout on help and then with a group of paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just exciting to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was bited!
I was bited!"
"Heal his leg was revoked," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, "There is a hail in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was fled to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in a critical state.
It's unwise what kind of hay attacked.
The life saver Larry Giles said by a media letter that a hail had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic damage on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and for the purpose of carrying out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 hajars in the area, but that most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with rows with beauty products with special assistants in style of stormagasins.
As part of a great effort to take the beauty market in Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while mode and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and are launched in several shops next year, if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is done as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelters previously used for television, microwave and housing products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing varieties from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with fired areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relancers the range of Boutique-makeup, so most of the products are suitable for veganians – something that is increasingly required by younger shopers.
In addition, the parfume shop Fragrance shop is testing in two Sainsbury shops. The first one opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and development against purchase of small amounts of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets must do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops are going to look like stormagasins, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introduceing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sale of daily products and have made purchases more profitable.
The former attempts of the supermarket to update beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute about how the earnings of the pharmaceuticals in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical chain with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and the device of our rows with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our selection of brands is designed to meet all needs and the encouraging environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "racing", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP
Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones left "rassing", after the TV host Holly Willoughby subtracts from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle fire to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left the project.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones rageful after she has withdrawn from their lucrative lifestyle fire in the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "awesome", when the popular TV woman at a enthusiastic meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire meant that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she no longer had enough time for their housing product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to advertise that she left Truly, while Jones fled out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should have been dealing with the next few decades.
Her decision to draw was surprised to all involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday.
There is a stock full of goods in the mainquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the release from This Morning host, which is among the highest earnings stars in the UK, can cost the company several millions due to large investments in products – all from puders to stearinlyses to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and the husband Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Governing President in March.
The two couples take vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin who was on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, "and then we got in love."
He laughed with the criticism he would receive from the news media to give a comment that "not is a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parodie on a news host.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting, after Trump exclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear armoring of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear armament have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho on Saturday, the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly said that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action to disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic viewpoint in the speech at its electoral meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a tranquility for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had created positive results – the end of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of earthly residues from American militarymen.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 100,000 people outside trying to get into this close-packed arena, we would have about 200 people stand there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes crush the island and kill hundreds
In the afterplay after the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombox population stood out of home, no national disaster state was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling international emergency aid.
"In many cases it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children composes a team to travel to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster preparation, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency action.
Because of the earthquakes for which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refugees are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but it seems that a tsunamisir is missing, and it has probably influenced the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of disaster.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in his electoral struggle, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Jokos' administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the course of the next year's electoral struggle.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying secular tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christians and Muslim bands struggled on the streets with makeths, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compares in the last moment to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was back with 1-0.
He stitched to the ball with the left foot before he made a high shot to the remotest bar.
The ball fled high above the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch, I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 by half-care, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea arriver delivered with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a fast one-two on the midway.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and ended against the remotest bar with a shot with the left foot beyond Liverpools Alisson Becker.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorandum of discussion on the "rewrite of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatic, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "galship" and a "experience to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was unavoidable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The picturestorm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his father Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic image of Cromwell is a evidence of attitudes in the 19th century and part of historiography for a figure that many still think it is worth healing.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defendant of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is a precise image is subject to a continuous historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognisable figure representing the one side of the fight.
His performances like Lord Protector are also worth healing and remembering."
Drebergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, which is only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overwhelmed pulse year and smurred into blood near a pig pad on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pig injections with vaccines for a pig use on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai Province of China.
He said he had travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigstone next to was open.
He said there was a big ornaments with blood in his mouth.
A judicial investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bided the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the place of action.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare, but there is previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg had a whale farmer against his tractor, to his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "trigger".
"They're just a physician.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not gonna hurt you.
You just need to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the orchestra Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, the orchestra Rosa becomes weaker, as it moves over the cooler waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will give strong rain of floods in northern Mexico and southwestern USA over the coming days.
Rosa had winning 38 m/s, a category 1 orchestra, at 10 a.m. (danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure runner across the Pacific, moving east towards the United States' west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture to the north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure runner that comes closer and create strong rain in the south-western United States in the coming days.
Locally 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous stormflows, liquid decay and possibly earthquake in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain of up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great probability for storm flows with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert to foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform clowns into bulging rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust blossoms.
The low pressure runner approaching will give strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can give smaller amounts of liquid downfall and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their raintime.
Spread tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there can be great temperature fluctuation throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but it remains fairly hot in the tropes.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the Central USA Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast regions.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate view indicates that there is a great probability for temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million so the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's arbitrary statements of witness from the nominated to the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that reportedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the general programs to tell about Friday’s late development: an agreement composed by Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to carry out a week long investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate's ruling committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunk state was pouring on her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school festival.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional Witness explanation that he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company sumd average seer figures on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no viewers from other stations immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a match under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose sensible hosts have strongly boasted up on the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted the whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC was on the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interests remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican sent a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators cried to him when he tried to take a elevator for the hearing of the judge committee.
He was standing with a downward look for a few minutes while he was scared out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All television stations covered live a few hours later when the judged committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote for under the conviction that the FBI would examine the accusations against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are in submission in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake took his decision.
Flake's choice had influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
Great Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "legal politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "legal politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shot kill on Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected to stand behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect of the shot killing at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligible killing, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officers released video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the brills at the workshop and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the WAFB CBS-datter company.
After the hearing of Simpson, the police said he had confessed the shot murder on Wayde.
His deposit is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The judicial doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where it was said that the death cause was a wound from a gun shot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the region have assisted with the research that led to arrest.
The Chairman of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "omhu and hunting for righteousness".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per battle last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer at LSU, Will Wade said that the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Waydes' death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spies ash over Mexico City
Ash, spies from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disasters Prevention warned Saturday Mexicans to get away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored the rump and shaking over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ashes on car routes in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 miles southeast of the capital, since a earthquake measured 7.1 on the judge scale, shake the central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police are in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who want independence, joined with unobedients as many thousands participated in rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of the Catalonian Polaris' vote on release.
A group of masked separatists kept unobedient, thrown with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also battle later on the day when the police used their spells to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups called "Not forgotting, nothing forgiven" and were met with Unionist demonstrators who cried "Long life Spain".
14 people were treated for smaller injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The vote remains high in the independent region one year after the vote of 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separateist catalans.
The elections voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral connection was low and those who were opposed to the release boykotted in great terms the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were damaged last year, after the police tried to stop the abstention of the vote during violent conflicts at voting places throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night for Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dare hope that Catalony can gain independence.
"The last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy to have the opportunity to vote, but now we sit firmly," he said.
Even though they received a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved themselves in exile or sitting in detention and are waiting for their role in the retention of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There are bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have waited for his case since last year, reported that he would make up the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The post as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to take away the reversal of the democratic values and the undercutting we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car

The event occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Police officer Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A bracket might also have been fired to the car at a time.
Shot from Menga gives Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The crowns Livingston overwhelmed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved on side with Hibernian on the second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the liga in this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before then, Ranger's visit to Rapid Vienna in Europe League will receive Thursday.
In return, Livingston builds their unquestioned strike for six struggles, and Chief Coach Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances for cash outholding
Holt's team should have been before long before, they scored, and their direct game style created great problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but surrendered across front of the target, after Alan Lithgow unavoidably hit outside the target, after he swallowed in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-border head before the target.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play before them because they knew they could give outstanding problems in death ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers went free park, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the edition for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time Rangers had dominated the property of balls, but struggled to get through the defense of the home team, and Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos had a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was defeated with the feet of the Rangers targeter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's death ball situations.
Continuous surrenders arrived in Livingston's field, but were rejected, and two demands for penalty parks – after Halkett's tackling the replacement Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played amazing and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their style and troop are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he came to.
There were many heroes.
Chief Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defence, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the tens throughout the battle.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked sharpness – only once they got the only home team – and it is a great wake for Rangers, which is in the middle of the point table.
Erdogan may receive mixed reception in Køln
There was smile and blue sky on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreements in areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approach to the European Union.
The Erdogan then went to Køln to open a new, great mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a human amount of 25,000 from gathering before the mosque, but lots of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, which is seen as a whole of some German Turks and the spot as an autocracy of others.
Accidents on the road in Deptford: Cyklist dies in collision with the car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were savers at the place, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the site, at Childers Street, about 1,6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said that police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road locks have been set, bus routes have been changed, and motorists are invited to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers damaged during distress
Six prison officers have been injured in a high-security prison, according to the Office.
There was disturbance in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the disturbances are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are picked up to deal with the rebellion that involves eight prisoners and takes place in one flee of prison.
The officers were treated for smaller facial damage on the site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison workers are engaged in dealing with the ongoing disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are declared that the responsible are notified to the police and can end with spending longer time behind the tremmers."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unobedients were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances, where employees were attacked with billard balls.
The Orca Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a stormflood (dryer areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure hits Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the orchestra Rosa moves over the desert landscape of the southwestern United States and creates the risk of stormflood.
National Weather Service has already sent warnings about the storm flood for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a twot that only "tier tropical cycles had maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For them outside the risk of the storm flow, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flood is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the next highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja island of California in Mexico.
Rosa still has orchestra strength Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north with 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and give a great risk of flooding.
"The rainfall is expected to be 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwest desert region of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and liquid decay in deserts and earthquakes in mountain terrain.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder trials
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of murder trials after a 16-year-old was found with a petty year in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset pronounced.
Officers have called on everyone who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was subject to the "vildness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the democratic party's uncertain and incredible tactics," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "vildness, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave witness explanation before the congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually conceived to her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also issued a Witness explanation at the hearing of his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skillful legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of meeting republicans at the votes at mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lifetime is.
You can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out of a mission to "fight against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place at Friday no later than one person placed high in the Republican Party, CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death growth
At least 384 were killed, and many of them swallowed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, proclaimed authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves hit the coast at a shumbing time, suctioned many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The Tsunami occurred after a earthquake that measured 7.5 on the judge scale.
"When the tsunamitrus emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They didn't run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of Indonesia's disaster preparation GDPB, under a briefing in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, the slept cars, tree tribes, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More managed to survive by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16.700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The catastrophic preparation tool has published air photographs that show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoons continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be marked in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Government for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy triggered during Friday's large earthquakes was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bug, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found fixed under the wall breaks from interconnected buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damages could be greater along the 300 km long coastal line north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely lame without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300 000 living here," said the Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts to notify that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was sent.
Amateur recordings that are shared in social media can be heard by a man at the top floor of a building who desperately calls warnings about tsuamia, which comes closer to people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and wears buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that dismissed the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with emergency help from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a hard need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for assistance, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami smokes more than 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions employees from Donggla have come safely to Palu city, where employees are looking for lie under presensions set in the farm at their account. They passed areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that they were so many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when auxiliary organisations started the hard work to put the assistance back, complaints were found that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and employees from abroad should only come in if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster, we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families kept the missing people firm in the hope that their nearest would become the miracles that lighten the thrill stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a cloak.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been caught under wall breaks for two days with her mother’s body next to herself.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were among his students.
"As the veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he had sent whatsApp messages to the participants of Palu, who were part of the festival on the beach, after the news about the interruption of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles.
However, his messages resulted only in one crying fluebe instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes 26.750 USD while filling the money machine in Newport on the Leveee
Twenty stolen on Friday morning 26,750 USD from a Brink's agent that was meeting a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car driver had cleared the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a pocket that should have been delivered.
According to the press release, the Witnesses saw a number of suspects who escaped from the site, but the police did not indicate how many involved in the incident.
All with information about the identity of the thieves, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the name Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurs before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande on the show, which cancelled for "feeling reasons", said the creator of the show.
The name is a abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year where he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed the name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborative partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between lower and uppercase letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico's AMLO does not promise to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th year for a bloody reconciliation action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on the place on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements hit root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal bands.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they use on research within the field, says investor and AI-user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. Government has given statements of artificial intelligence, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, however, introduced their plan last year and aimed at taking the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030 at the latest.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far back in relation to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in the AI," Lee said.
Doubleing the budget could double the chances of the next major performance in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest rated American Othello player, and later he became leader of Microsoft Research and director of the department of Google in China.
Lee recognised former technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition arrives, so that the next visionary can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to achieve legates from the government, says Lee.
"It isn't China that hits the academic leaders, it's the big businesses," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered employees.
China's State Council sent their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money by other government organisations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the US Defence Ministry established a joint center for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion USD in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a national security committee for artificial intelligence, has been still for several months.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would solve a decade of old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement in the Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought to include in the NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycot campaign has raised doubts about whether the voters will represent the 50 % required to make the vote valid.
The question on the voting note was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Followers of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is worth paying for access to associations such as the European Union and the NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote today on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's paraply, because it means more secure life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and do it.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The state election Commission said that no irregularities were reported at 13 o'clock.
However, the electoral participation was only 16 per cent compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We hear in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko attended the vote in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country which would open up for membership of the NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled up before tents, which were set up by those who would boykotte the vote.
"We are for the NATO and the European Union, but we will gain membership with traveled pand, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strongly demanded investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote for, because more than 80% of our citizens join the European Union and the NATO," said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "safe of our future".
A opinion measurement published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the required decision-making.
Another opinion measurement made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the prosperous government since it entered in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights through the Brighton Defense and Scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran through three Brighton defenders before he was hung out on the open path.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trees.
He fought by one defender, and then he ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used its right boot to list the Brighton painter Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero struggles with some problems with the feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him to play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate advance in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deeply inside the territory of Brighton.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he brought Sterling to the remotest bar.
The Sky Blues-forward stitched the ball in the network just before it swallowed by target.

Scherzer wants to drille Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castuen Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a match more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least fast in a wild card space with a 5-2 victory over National Friday evening, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audiences here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level I'm going to stand for this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited about playing under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet notified the starting position for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the plet for 34th time, trained his castles Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inning in this season.
Trump holds a electoral meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around his elections to the High Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of republikan meetings at the positions of the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is in the game in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It is one of the big, big ones – you can't vote on me, but you're actually voting on me. That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see that it happens right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all the resources available. You can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt who they're going over to get power and control.
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "contradictions and blocks".
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "peace and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the supreme democratic senator in the Senate's ruling committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the sound bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you like the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, no, wait just – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their attitudes
When momentum's activists in my local party voted about censuring me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last of a number of Members from Labour who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have given our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she took a strong distance from antisemitism.
In my case, the censur attack was criticizing me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In view of the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local parliamentary member, meetings have just been such on Friday evening.
Today, the tone in many meetings is unfortunately not that way, and the promise of "friendlyr, slower" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that deviating views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighing for whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, as I previously thought I shared a political position, began to expect me to make an U-vending and adopt a position that I would otherwise never have agreed – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that is really no matter what I say – follows a long strip of gross messages on the social media that call for the elimination and contradiction of middle-seeking policy and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the fighting will of the colleagues who every day are exaggerated with sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
However, in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every mistrust voting or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years, that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so exciting, I'm going to "nothing."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left our classroom in a falling state, and I set myself to create better public services for those who need it – whether it has been as a city council member or minister of the government.
I have never hide my policy, nor under the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current management.
To those who submitted the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country approaches Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats of elimination or political suitability will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsealed Ayr becomes top team
Two seen scores may have made the final result to draw a not completely true image, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in the Tent's Premiership.
They are now on the top of the point table and are the only unwitting team of ten.
Finally, it was as much as their superior defence as their better utilisation of the chance of homeholding, and trainers Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been challenging until now, and we are still unquestioned, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Andersons score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish team player Rory Hughes, who was distributed for the fight by Warriors, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo built Ayr's leadership with a punishment park just before the half-care. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Andersons scoring, followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the track on the bear. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from the Climo.
The functioning Ayr manager Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the forwarding Ayr clown.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the bars and followed up with a more nearly straight after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe snapped David Armstrong's box kick and sent pilot Gregor Henry to the fifth score of the homeway.
Still Game stars looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still the Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it appeared that he has acquired the director of an authorised restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series that he writes and is the main person with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan plans a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The shoe player refused to comment on history, but a source suggested Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Have is ours": the country of India Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol around the headquarters of the fleet, filled in rigs, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Flower bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overwhelmed with the motto: "The have is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the entire country of Bolivia, a coastal area that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
The hopes may be at the highest for several decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a feeling of community and clarity, and of course waiting with a positive view of the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on Large Screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Haag will make Bolivia aware that, after several decades of discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereignty over a area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s carismatic indigenous president, who is faced with a controversial election fight next year, also has much to play at the judgement on Monday.
"We're close to return to Pacific," he promised last August.
However, analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the party of Bolivia – and that there would not be major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has seats in the Netherlands, does not have the power to overcome the Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice declines judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "not was complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given relapse.
"The case of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' warriorism has done it with the remaining Chilean welfare, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally fast.
On Monday Bolivia will be given "a extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance of "finishing an anniversary of 139 years with disagreements and gaining benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there is no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never settle their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with promises given at a summit in Singapore between the rivalising leaders.
His comments were given in addition to the fact that the U.S. foreign minister Mike Pompeo seems to face a restart of the fixed nuclear diplomat over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a "worn dream" to continue penalties and the US's opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war, will ever bring North Korea to knee.
Washington is retaining to declaration as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump will have another summit.
However, there is widespread skepsis in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to the removal of a arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk for a collection of superb head clothing in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractic hat has dominated on Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their inevitable creatures down the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was an overwhelmed with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelones with jewels and even an ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute coutures.
One creation looked like dives with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a melted vaffelis.
And if you continue the great fashion stations, you're lucky.
Stylespeakers predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The battle hats arrive in the slopes of "La Bomba", the strap hat with a 60 cm wide shadow that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the highest unpractical hatred that was spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down on the catwalk – a beach bag, which is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bastask with bastfruits and a white leather handle was the most adjunctive in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hat and beach bags in general shops next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in giant size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Scotland independent schools have many great akademic results behind themselves, and it is still in 2018 with a number of other unique exam results that are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best service level to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can compose and implement a tailored pensum, we experience that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits the head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we can not only stay in English when we want to build relations and trust among people from other countries.
We can see the latest exam results this year that languages are the highest in the statistics with most exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high character A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72% of the students received character A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of the students who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subject choices at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' pensa and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that, among the reasons why employers were unable to occupy vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career youths choose, they, if they have learned another language, have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skills like this.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a precedent to the competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement with more than 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When speaking more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ between the languages in which they are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, e.g. Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to achieve success, regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bee le faire.
John Edward is the leader of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost beyond fans that will see LeBron James play its first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday opening game before the season start against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet fixed how many minutes he's playing.
"It becomes more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twisted that James is most likely not going to play the whole game.
After the training earlier in the week James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I'm in my career, I don't have to fight before the season start to get ready," he said.
Trumps electoral meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a strip of electoral meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of the Judge appointed by Trump at the Supreme Court is put in place, Trump is trying to provide support for the next mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's selection meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is most likely to speak of this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, which has been nominated to the High Court. The hearings were excited because of accusations of sexually violating behaviour, and the expected vote in the Senate of Confirmation has been taken into account for a week while the FBI examines the accusations.
But the primary objective of this strike electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans faced with a hard choice in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when the Republicans try to protect and build the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Reuters," according to Reuters.
"Control over the congress is as important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter into the busy campaign time," said a speaker of the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump trailers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the opinion measurements.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to troop up to give him a boost in opinion measurements," said Simon Haeder, who is dealing with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Clearer Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle spirit and is trying to keep the hope alive before Sunday single-dueller
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man dolls might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The turning momentum pendul is a fully invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it a little like momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he kept the fourteen.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they are 4 points in front, and there are 12 more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are lots of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can praise with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and set a good example for his teammates.
The high jubilees were higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duals.
His put that secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar cry – the kind of cry that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's marvelous, but sympathetic couples have received four points in four matches, and they appear faultless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience, shows that it will be the most difficult to hit Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory was fastened by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
All of them synchronized on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man dolphs, when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes digged the Spanish and the Swedish guy down into a hole, they were never near to get out.
Sunday there's no one who can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has created a significant leadership before the last day, but the four-man doctrines have also shown that the team of the United States has the battle spirit, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates leadership at 10-6 prior to last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a leadership over the United States at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have hitherto got four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the pokal they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unprecistic American team in the morning's four balls and won series 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in foursomes, they won four matches, but they were still back.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have received the name "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup's history, who has won four points in their first four matches.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed into fourballs and then defeated elegantly a desolate Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two matches Saturday, had little genial glimpse, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's four-balls and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and received a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it, as they want, on a light blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They received a hard fighting 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has struggled back after being back with four points before the single matches. However, as Furyks currently has the pokal, they have to achieve only unequivocal to keep it.
However, after having been second-bed for two days, it seems that they cannot master an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not dispose of unilaterally if there is no trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said Saturday the United Nations that continued sanctions reinforce their mistrust to the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the global organization's General Assembly that North Korea had proved "a considerable willingness" in the last year, e.g. by stopping nuclear and missile tests, developing an area for nuclear tests and not promised to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We haven't seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
"No trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first step and restrain unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-separated" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech was important, as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as it had otherwise been the case of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim promised to work "Atoom Heritage on the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end of the Korean war, which came out in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to soften up international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States are insisting on 'atomic disarmament first' and expanding the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposing the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The consciousness that the penalties can bring us in the knee is a desired dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that they continued to reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. Chairman pointed out at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so firmly locked."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ris' speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the fire of North Korea's rockets against the American continent was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump, Kim called a "rocked man" on the suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for these measures, but said, "It's no matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side line during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea accused him just a few hours later to put "punishable demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile and an atomic complex if the United States took "like steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar steps", he demanded, were the security lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where studying the whole night kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
A scientist has shown that students at the best university of the world often do not know the first thing to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he thinks, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after keeping a record of the effects of sleep lack on learning.
"When the post was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get this first to know now when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains the students how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sports performance and your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director for University Health, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep shortage during the week.
The hourly course consists of different interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a collegie room where students must click on coffee cups, gardines, runshoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear how sleep shortage over a long time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are invited to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know that it won't change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know it - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students has led to an increasing problem of sleep.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and enough sleep, he said – it even opposes weight gain, because sleep lack makes the brain believe that you hungry why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to put an alarm so they know when to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can move at the day rhythm and make it more difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measures from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers led another defeat on the outside, when Dolly Mengas's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take thanks with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the outground since 4-1 triumph on St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard it only other defeat in 18 matches as trainers. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not reply to.
Rangers now smokes to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up at a third place after Hibernian with only the target to difference.
And there could be several bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judgments of Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a thrown item, which seemed to come from the outdoor section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by tons by Ayr.
Holt, however, said with the same 11 who barbered a point of Hearts' leadership last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents across the pathway.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the battle, when Mengas first delivery sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goals, but the midway player's attempt passed.
A free park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked over the back bar.
Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
At least, Alfredo Morales was not satisfied, when judge Steven Thomson undergone the columbian's appeals to the punishment park, when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a quarter's game.
Rangers had only two shots on targets in the first half of the year, but former Rangers targeter Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibalys headshots and Ovie Ejaria's tomb shots.
Even though Livis opened in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a dead ball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga that could easily kick it in target.
In the break Gerrard Coulibaly replaced with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pots when the pilot sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outstanding to play on their premises with many long balls up the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the leadership in the last part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goals.
Rangers' replacer Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late punishment park after being dried with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Annual book: Inventor of the winner
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": on 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TALLE... – was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Goats invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that would in the long term lead to the apparatus known as the goat counter.
The Geiger Counter has become a firm component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as bondage scientists:
Man, "What the hell is it?"
Rogers: "It's a giant counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans, "Keep up, now it's in it!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common for many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine can be promised in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, learning the immune defense to recognise cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from patients and change them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promised vaccine."
HER2 "become several forms of cancer to develop", including breast-, ovarian, lung and intestine cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells out of patients and "teacher" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a specific type of leukaemia.
Canye West held Trump-friendly speech on a MAGA hat after his SNL action.
It didn't work well.
After an inconsistent appearance in the Saturday Night Live Study, Kanye West was bowed off when he shouted the US President, Donald Trump, and said that he would set himself up as a president candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town on a Make America Great Again-cassette, he began to speak against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I'm so often talking to white people who say, "Why do you like Trump, he's racist?"
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have been moved from the United States forever," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star grined with Brett Kavanaugh's witness explanation in the Senate's Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charger.
Although the recordings were not shown, the comic Chris Rock Wests uploaded to the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to show West by putting up the recordings.
West also complained to the audience of poor treatment backstage because of his head clothing.
"They mobbed me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hate."
They mocked me!
And they said I was deeply sinking," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you see how deep I'm sinked?" and said that he would take his Superman cap on, because it means "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience blowings at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be painfully concerned, Variety reports with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose dawn boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It, while he was dressed out like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twisted: "For one of the most courageous people: DO NOT LAD YOU COURT OF THE PULL."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter twisted that West is just "as he is, and it's totally fine."
"But I don't choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") that embraces and excels an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we also have," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed the name, and therefore follow Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapkolleg Snoop Dogg has called Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musical prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

The claims are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out after toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is known to swing sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress longs out after the stereotypical macho whole and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that there's been something wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic maskulinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who was recently married to his Game of Thrones-Medstar Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very mind."
"For now, it's a lot about me – where are we going wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what do we have learned young men in their grown up?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic maskulinity due to the very maskulin characteristics.
He continued: "What is inborn, and what is allowed?
What are the young men learning from the television and on the streets that make them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of our great questions of time – how do we change that?
'Cause it's obvious that something's gone wrong for the young men.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make followers to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he's "finished with battle fields and horses".
Kit contributes from November to a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother, who is thieve.
The actress recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that it has given me my coming family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character, Jon Snow, is in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslies family landing in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 8200,000 people in the country are affected, says the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new cases were sexually transferred, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly into some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, Chinese health authorities report at a conference in the Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100.000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT persons is, accordingly, a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or later with women because of the country's conservative values.
Many infection cases are due to the lack of use of prevention in these situations.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff leaked data on republikan senators and torture against "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
Member of the Representatives' House Maxine Waters denied in the Saturday accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the claims came from websites and supported from "the extreme right wing".
"Looks, lies and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter lookup.
The published information contained reportedly home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate concerning sexual assaults against the High Court's Nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been submitted by Waters' people, then they published information about a member of the Waters staff, says The Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is totally insane and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraud and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this gap of information.
This unjustified accusation is absolutely insane and a direct lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's a angry denial," said Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congress member.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't become disaster.
You must not question the motives of the accusator.
You'll have to keep your brain."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, which was criticized for being too angry during Thursday consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aimed at taking Waters' seat in the mid-term election, also made its opinion on Twitter.
"Store, if it's true," he twisted.
In the official statement of Waters, she says that her staff have contacted the relevant authorities and the power of order on these fraud.
"We will ensure that the actors are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English turns on again – underwhelming spy comedie with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British ice leather, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series that started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the sarcastic self-satisfaction be the new potential of the country's export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been allowed to make broilers again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic discovery directed to places where the movie visitors do not speak English.
He, of course, is the stumped secret agent, who, despite his wish to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife punch Mr. Bean and properly climb of him who performanced a single tone for Chariots of Fire singer at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international lush bucks that left chaos in his refrigerator, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the tribe from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a middle- age armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite underwhelming and strangely overflowing, especially now where more "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be focused on children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as atkinson's stupid film fools in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point of the film is that United Kingdom is in serious clips.
A Internet hacker has infiltrated England's sophisticated spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field of terrifying the responsible agent – a unfortunately very little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and battle-clean Prime Minister, who already suffers a complete melting in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing its best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that each active spy has been revealed, she is required to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, it's the stupid Johnny English, who is now a school supervisor at a high school, but who in hide teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of rock training in spionage.
English hastes back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hardly tested previous right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthusiastic but well - well-mening outer cap – a role on which Vicki Pepperdine was wasted.
Thus, the royal information service's all the business of Batman and Robin is back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being emigrated by the carismatic and horrible technician Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their angry risky ecadades: Decreed as servants they put fire to an ancient French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Voltas luxuryacht; and English creates clean ragnarok, as he trys to use virtual reality glasses to make himself known to Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the final sequence of the movie, but how well-mening and energyy it is, there is a sense of children’s vision of it.
Right medium.
And as I could not avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to fight with plans for four-day working week with unchanged wages to the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that English can be accomplished with a four-day week of work, but a few pay for five.
The party would claim to have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra Friday.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' weekends without going down in wages.
Sources say that the idea would conform to the party's economic objective to draw the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a economy in change.
A experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It is not going to happen one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that suits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the overall strategy of the party for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the electoral campaign in 2017.
However, the objective is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered in the party."
Labour's Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says that he is determined to flee the power back from "anonymous Directors" and "Using" in supply companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister's plans also sow doubts about whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back as a government with Labour in the spits could "respect" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in business management and to establish including owner funds to distribute 10 per cent of private companies' share value to employees, which are to receive up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has exposed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's finding could cause the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview showed on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I joined the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Do you do it?"
He was steel set, determined and unique."
On the other hand, Graham's voice seems to be in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and otherwise would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it most powerful," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host town of the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive thousands of people on the great plenary of Central Park, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of making an end to extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an enlargement of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that struggles to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can create attention about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now when they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it only another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they do a difference by signing a subscription collection on the web or making a Twitter lookup?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding objectives and policy measures equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which are expected to have influenced more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a cooperation between investors and traders. They strive to "help children to achieve their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to deal with nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 twots from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with underernähring can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the England Government has now promised resources to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's often asked questions, saying, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It's gonna be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we're going to snub and make mistakes.
But as with the movement of citizens' rights and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the acting at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy sports, says the US Ministry of Industry
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East, reveals the US Minister for Industry, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria, especially where they operate on the invitation of the legal government, is a deficit to expand the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And he says that there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has the opportunity with our fleet to ensure that there are free passages on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that regards itself as the "Voice of the American Energy Consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and said that they are in the bottom and the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, while he referred to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the European export of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers of the Trump Administration, including Donald Trump itself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is only a economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of disadvantaged competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said the Russian energy minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the fact that a third party is mixing into our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Cancer, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to set up the presidential election in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to set up the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said Saturday.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering to stop.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front," she said, according to the Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a strong view of setting up the presidential election."
Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump during the City Council and said that he "does the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his High Court's Nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
In a second Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI is going to investigate the case before the vote."
However, a Thursday opinion measurement shows that the majority of Warren's own backland do not believe that she should set up in 2020.
According to an opinion measurement from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" choosers in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate time.
The measurement showed greater support to former governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible settlement.
Other highly profiled democratic candidates, discussed in the context of the presidential election in 2020, count among other former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Associated Press writes that he notifies his final decision in January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a selection meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of violence at home.
"What my own son is undergoing after he has come home, makes it possible for me to relate to other families that notice the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home," she told the audience to a Trump-chooser meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder and they are thinking if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence at home against a woman, to prevent the notification of violence in the home and to be in possession of a weapon in drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a speaker of the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support resistance to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law which refuses asylum to victims who escape from band violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a partial independent declaration in support of a asylum applicant contradicting the law, says the NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union lodged in August against the Federal Law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are bandages" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The government chargers, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum applicants originate, countries with widespread problems with bands and violence at home.
The new American asylum legislation rejected a decision made by the U.S. foreign event in 2014 which allowed undocumented immigrants who escaped from violence at home to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's State Advocate, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "is dismissed from the state, federal and international law of decades."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such obstacles are contrary to that principle," states the Partie independent declaration.
The advocates also argued in the declaration that the law on rejecting immigrants damages the American economy, as there is more likely that they become independent and "lever the necessary labour."
In June, justice minister Jeff Sessions dismissed immigration judges the right to give asylum to victims who escape from violence at home and volunteer violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear in the light of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in its announcement of the law on 11 June.
It has never been the point that asylum should address all the problems – or just all serious problems – that people throughout the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, the attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation only worsened.
"It's very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she comforted her little fever-ramed boy at a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Where minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed homes to sort in bloody possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the earthquake of 7.5, could not follow.
Some of the damaged ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong descendants.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth hall, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was mast up against a corrupt wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accused China of infinite methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-sided ad in an American newspaper that struck on throms for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, accused the U.S. ambassador in China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. President, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Daily's paid imprisonment in Des Moines Register – Iowas's best selling newspaper – after accusing China to interfere with the 6th November Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation for Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise for promovering trade, Beijing and Washington are now confined to an escalating trade war where they have several times imposed customs duties on each other's import products.
China's countervailing duty in the trade war would affect exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China, former governor for years in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "approaches the use of the unfine methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press by driving a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the kiosques here in Beijing, there will be only few disagreements. And you will not get a fair picture of the different positions of the Chinese people on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he didn't say which.
The Republicans promote women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the High Court's Nominated Brett Kavanaugh against complaints on sexual abuse, analytics warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the coming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in bow, and most Republicans have already published that they like to see the vote process continue.
"This can't be done about," said Grant Reher, professor of State Knowledge at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for an FBI study for 11 hours will mild anger choosers.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrations cried out: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement by Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic says that.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach a new height," said the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"The people say that it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women's swing choosers in the forests and younger electors – 18-29-year-old – who rarely vote, despite not like the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations on the sexual abuse of the High Court's denominated, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to nominate, it could lead to a disadvantage.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote of the committee or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is put to responsibility; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this, and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, chairman of the United States Priority – a group supporting Democrats to be elected – points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes to whom they should believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh Witness explanations, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new statement from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford’s Witness Declaration, while 35% said that they believed Kavanaugh certainly or probably.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either likely or definitely lying under his witness declaration, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After request from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations submitted by Ford and at least another one, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford said last week under ed to Senate's court committee that Kavanaugh was full of acting on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the High Courtnominator showed her his sex parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is Inruption and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee jokeed that the plan with Inruption is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique to the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inruption is, according to the company’s Executive Director, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers at project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the available tools on Inruption's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether to change it completely, so all their business models are suddenly overflowing."
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a lookup at the Media on Saturday that Inruption's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet that is built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrude is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Spiritual receiver of Victoria Cross from World War 1
The only priest of the English church, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I, is celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Wann won the order on 29 September, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a shield, and he was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vand, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredible symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning business.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Löjtnant Vand d. 29 September 1918 led his batalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under severe shield from machine gear and artillery."
Later he ran to the frontline and led his people with the "greatest courage" before he alone attacked an artillery and uninjured three canons.
Colonel Lieutenant Watn was killed by a German sniffskytt on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vand at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Watn also put a crane after the parade, which was listed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heritage."
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the star-pucked Bellator 206 and then will be refused to see the main event.
There were 13 struggles on the program from San Jose, including six struggles on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers of England became surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after keeping awake until early morning for just this struggle.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a child-owned movie as "a kind of sick joke."
"With the law, this content was not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, the senior president of Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in the future planning.
"When thinking of the re-send, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we do not find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when the change was changed, I got a lot of messengers, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're just having five matches instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "reverence" over sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than everyone else in his growing up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him until he came into the bigger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hop".
He also said that he was less up to win OL after being a parent.
The usual host on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken free a few months due to illness.
Daley was a guest of Lavers' first program and said he felt "minder worth" than all others in his growing up because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "Frem to today, the feelings of mind are worthy and feel different were the things that have given me strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The double olympic bronze winner has become a high-profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live open without negative consequences, and he would give others "hop".
The three-dobbling world champion said that he had been " surprised" when he loved a man – the U.S. film creatures Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, which is 20 years older than him, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told us that it is difficult to find someone at the same age that has experienced similar up and downturns when you go through so much in such a young age – he went to his first OL as 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would all do if I had to win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic Gold Medal.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as 40 years of diagnostic brain cancer.
Daley told that his father did not accept that he was to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I kept his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first came to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my whole life – to show in front of a home public at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song choice – the Proud of Heather Small – that had meant a lot during the recording to OL and still gave him gazehud.
Desert Island Discs is running on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Usharp Mickelson on the beach of Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th battle in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something with the shape if it shouldn't be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records by joining the competition every 2 years, was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's four balls and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five-dobled big wind had to be exaggerating and practicing his game in the hope of fixing the faces.
Even not at the peak of the career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the Le Golf National course, where the long raw often punishes wild shots.
And if the course wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson at the ninth battle on Sunday will meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has struggled with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans start the 12 single matches start strongly, Mickelson's struggle may be vital.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a clapp on my back, laid his arm about me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He's in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and this week too.
I probably didn't think he was going to play two matches.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldos records for most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely been able to measure with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven unfinished, even though Furyk said that his presence contributes with something undefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, mad, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid leadership before the last day of Ryder Cups single-uping can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a front of five points over the Americans, but was just getting picked up before the target line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice leadership in Valderrama, we had a nice leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team wins both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total leadership of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have to be full of scrap tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trofee, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enjoyed with the performance of his players on a difficult path, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performance that counts, and that's something completely different.
It's amazing to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters as golf player.
That's what the players need to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you're gonna leave your partner, because he's going to get the best in himself."
On the other hand, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced cokings on the last day. First at the winner team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made "Miraklet on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start that you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the intermediate fights.
We compose our team in relation to it and put the players on the path in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to guide the backwards and face Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it guarantees us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is again suspended
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war. However, the Germans must wait at least one year more due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The establishment of the largest ship in the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been exposed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a speaker from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but survival problems have suffered the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, shall replace the ageing fregates from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a strong canon, a large selection of anti-air shooting and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature for the latest fregates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the fregates away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which, accordingly, will cause Germany to appear as an overseas power factor – will already be deprecated when they are inserted, says Die Zeit.
The failed F125 fregat created headings last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not known much about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusual in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be governed by a crew of 120 seamen – that is only half of that crew from the older Bremen fregates.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and restricted the possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, including training of the crew, is also by being a problem.
It is said to have reached swamping €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of clear ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust sounds for the secret life of the flager museums
New research from a region in the Scottish highland is trying to reveal how flagermus uses the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that findings will throw light on the unique, flying mammals' behaviour and will help in the work of future preservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland National Trust and follows common flagermus, dwarf flagermus, long-drawn flager mice and water flager mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in closely selected places in the area to include the activities of the flager museums through the season.
Data are also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
Deep-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequency of the flager musculoskeletals and show the nature of what is doing.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of habitats is made.
Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal the most important areas of habitats and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat-conservative efforts such as the establishment of engles and how to best preserve forest areas for flager mice and similar species.
The number of flager mice in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen drastically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the reds and restrict their habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger.
Flag mice isn't actually blind.
But because they are mainly hunting at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use a advanced eco-location technique to find insects and fly out of obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares around the country, takes the flager mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect reds and sometimes make rescue actions.
The organization has even made Scotland the first and only dedicated flagermus reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight out of ten of Scotland flagermus species.
The operator of the area, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for the flager mouse," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
You have a lot that you don't know about the flager mice, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to trives."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flager mice before making maintenance tasks on property, since the destruction of a single new can kill up to 400 females and kids. This risks to eradicate a whole local population.
Flag mice is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, generate, or disturb them or their rescue.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand with.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flager mice, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects violent charges, while lawyers appeal to German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape chargers against him for "fax news" and says that people "will promover themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to appeal to the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raising an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fax news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-dobled winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promover themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called "a unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral destruction in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The event took place in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other on a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he should have raped her analyzed according to the submitted report in the City Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on the knee after the claimed event and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grabbed "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "paid of revaluation" and worried about being "officially disappointed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was faced with a change from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event should have taken place, and switched in summer to the Italian large club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will always regret" to lose car manufacturers
United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer at world level after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "angry", that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150.000 cars last year, where 90 % of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop our factory if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Executive Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is to deal with risks with the supply chain in the event of an outbreak without agreement.
Toyota's production is running on a tight timetable, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "composed to avoid precisely these inspections at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that does not just allow us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to take this option," he said BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we must be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustman at the factory, says that his members become more and more worried: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
A speaker of the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the preliminary justice minister Rod Rosenstein can "be exposed a week more", as the settlement of the High Court's Nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special accusation Robert Mueller on his shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the possible obstacles to the court.
Whether Trump will fire the preliminary Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence, has been a sladder subject in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered to bear microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to dispose of the president through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the reputation was that he would say up.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, which was then at the UN headquarters of New York.
Trump said that he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collapse with Senate's court committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, were to witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's choice.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that happens in the High Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the games of TV journalists for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open consultations or press meetings with high guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made a improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
Minister for Health contacts EU employees in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland NHS to express its gratitude and wish for them to be after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than a half years before Britain withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know that this must be a very uncertain period for you all.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the European Union have valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after head damage
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely surgered after having a little head damage in Saturday 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, it declares from Tennessees Mike Organ.
First trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the sidebar and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a bar and took him for further investigation.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "now details about the type or extent of the damage yet," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he claimed the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is starting with his first season in Tennessee State after a change from Illinois.
He had five thanks in Saturday before leaving the battle, which gives him 18 takings gathered this season.
Foreign buyers are charged with higher stamp fee when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged with higher stamp fee when buying a property in Britain. The extra money must help the homeless, according to the conservative party.
This move must depress Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide 120 million per year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged with a higher stamp fee when buying property in the UK for the benefit of homeless.
The drag will be considered as an attempt to match Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises about cheaper dwellings and to follow them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp fee will affect persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom. The profit from this is to be used for the government's battle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee added above the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and rental purchases can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 £ million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices rise and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the living market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp fee to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying grounds they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve the "injurious housing situation of the United Kingdom".
Corbyn has proposed a prominent number of housing reforms, including checks on rental prices and withdrawal of the hire's possibility to put people on the streets if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of setting up public housing buildings.
May said: "The last year I said that I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be sure that it is equally easy for foreign companies and persons living outside Britain to buy homes as for hard working British.
For all too many, the dream of possessing a home has become too far, and the indignity of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland trainer"
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at a time to become Scotland trainer.
The 42 shot enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to the Stadium of Light last summer after having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sport sound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on the Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it's always drawn in me.
But that option would only arise if I succeeded in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer of Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following the so established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success from if I can get this club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task, but I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period of assisting training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart’s Training Staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pulled down in the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the decline to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more fit now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divorce," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I really thought that the training work was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I managed, served reasonablely and had some success experiences.
But it may be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still such stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I always wanted to train, and now I do it. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17.30, shows the study
The heat wave this summer has increased the performance of England's puber, but has put restaurant chains under larger pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has decreased 4.8%, shows numbers.
Peter Martin, a company consultant at the CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continue the sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows the pattern of June, where pubs experienced more sale of 2.8%, except that the restaurants have been harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubbers and bars focused on the sale of beverages made it clearly best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of restaurants.
Pubbers with focus on food joints in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
In cross-border pub and barkets, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 % for the month, while the food fell by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outside home market, the weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still fighting, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will make real hurt above rising costs.
The long, warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hardly demanded breath."
The total increase in sales collected for pubers and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the decline in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubers, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than 9 £ billion, and they are leading in the area.
Each fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Each fifth child – all down to 11 years – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows study.
A study of 20.000 students in 4-9. class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content
20% of the students said they have a "main account" which they can show their parents
Each fifth child creates accounts on the social media they hide for the adults.
A study of 20.000 students from 4. class and forward reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" which they can show their parents while also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who called on others to "abandon me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It is terrible that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most winning athletics of Scotland, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those taking decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world in Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help to exhibit a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres runs at OL in Atlanta in 1996, which is now often a commentator for BBC, could not go after a transitory ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote, "A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would get up to it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm very quick, I've learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows receives mixed receiver online
A breast pump business has shared the sentences online with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are painted.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first soundless breast pump, the technological consumer magasin has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising that must show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a dinner full of hooks, for a song, in which it blows. says, "Yes, I'm painting myself, but you don't see any straw" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't yea, it's my chests."
The reconstituted says, "Pull it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I'm painting my barm."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has resulted in controversials online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it's laughing with the "terrors" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and food before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.
Elvie breast pump fits discretely in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another writes: "It is understandable that both mother and child are traumatic.
But yes, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What a insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertising directed to mothers pumping milk ( often on their workplace or on toilets) and feels like 'cows'.
It is not an advertising that roses or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they've danced with the discrete pumps in their bh's.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on that many women who breathe say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, which gives women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provoking launch.
By draging a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we showed the freedom that the new pump can give in an entertaining and recognisable way."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children in secret moved to tent camp at Texas' border
The number of retained migrant children has been exploded, even though the number of migrants has not changed. This is partly due to a harder retoric and the Trump administration's scratch laws that make it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their possibility of staying in the country by standing up and taking a child.
The risk of home transmission increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who were seeking to sponsor unledged minors.
The management later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had pure punishment certificates.
"Nearly 80 % of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue hunting those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal with the children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in the court within a month of their retirement.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and speaking their case for legal residence to a immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children are being caught, the higher the probability is that they get anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, it is said from assistant workers and in reports that have come from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more expressed on larger installations such as Tornillo, where the size makes it difficult to observe if a child suffers.
They added that movement to a town of tents without mental preparation or the possibility to say goodbye to friends can raise traumas that many already fight with.
Syria announces American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" that they should be drawn immediately
When Syria’s foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier Minister, said that the residence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and deprived of fighting terrorism, and they will "will be met with equivalent funds."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "neast is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have escaped from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleaned all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "ungal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syria-Arabic forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-heated country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the circumstances were good enough for them to return home, and then he accused "some western countries" to "spread unjusted fear", which made the refugees disappear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these return", he said.
"They police what should be a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebellious city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political conversations.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack was avoided from Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million lives.
Moualem, however, stressed the fact that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions will be followed by jihadists from the Nusrafront, a arrival group of Al-Qaeda, which will "be destroyed".
The United Nations Senior Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call on the first meetings of the new committee to clarify a postwar constitution for Syria and run the way for a choice.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the legislation of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another president's period
From the logic, Trump is likely to be reselected in 2020, unless the Kingdom law and the Scandals finish his presidential period in advance, which many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what undoubtedly becomes "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present, there is no sign of viewer tiredness.
Since 2014, the sighting figures in the best time have been almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost threefold to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time to compare with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacular that people are attracted by because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC Drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet which becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced competitor and author bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The caosset has an entertainment value.
However, in contrast to all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Switching channels are only the most privileged admired.
And yet, it is about more than being informed citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's strutselder jacket to $15,000 ("coated with hybrids," wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's living descriptions of Trumps anatomi.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (scanery with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, which was to be heard in the Senate's Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time, and people said, "It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Great sums find the road to the close mid-term selection of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a comparison of two "Congressional Districts" two congress members fight about the same seat.
This recently surrounded presidency district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative of Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another sitting congres member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17.
The cards were made about after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in January sentenced that the old district was legally set up in the favor of the Republicans.
The fight on the new 17th district has started a fight on financial resources between the Committees of the Great Partys, the Campaign of Democrats Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a smal victory in a high guard choice in March' special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for support to China, but reconstituted
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendship meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners dropped Trump's management team.
Officers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomates back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the foreign Ministry's spokesman in a statement earlier in the month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 to bla. drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cutting financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings went forward, North and Central American officials shot a top conference on security and economic development, which should continue to be a last year meeting which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in the middle of September, top officials made it clear that they would have the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference planned for the mid-October to send a signal on the importance of the Americans in the meeting, said diplomatics.
And the three American broadcasters in secret went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A speaker of Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomates who wanted to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could very well be the special accusator of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to research, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Accordingly, Mueller will also address its investigation to the question of whether Trump's campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia on the attack on the election.
If the Congress should come on new hands, Trump will probably be responsible, while he prepares to meet the voters again and with time, of course, a jury of his flocks.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not say that Trumps is inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put a state coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the checkcos law attackers in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the yearly blood bath afterwards.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the unreasonable march of democracy to- or decline.
In the United States, we are now faced with several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Vice-President Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the president and contempt his suitability for the official.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is unprecis.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false evidence?
And, what more important is, will we vote at the mid-term election for a congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once occupied the home country of my ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to turn the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be more than optimistic about it in the baggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic in front of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers will take on Thursday against SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive unconcluded results in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will, with a victory against the Austrians, have good opportunities to get forward from Group G of Europe League.
A knee damage prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from getting a seasonal debut before the 2-2- battle against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jump board to something even greater.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something with home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, another big European evening will be.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they have a good result in the last battle, but with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of all that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared, there were only few who talked to the family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the National World Study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told them to talk to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to care for them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National World Life Insurance Act.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t tell them in good time about your desires.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These options may be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your economic adviser: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the costs.
Long-term care can be financed, inter alia, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-surance with your own funds – as long as you have a economy for it.
Get the legal documents ordered: Take the legal matches in the race.
Get prepared a full power so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, if you are not able to communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power.
In that case, you will designate a trusted person who can make financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the opportunity.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs medical help and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put all of these details down, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a air rifle on the way home from a trip in the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and his hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place at 02.30 p.m., as "all random."
The victim didn't see the acting man.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to stand forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. It informs the authorities who expect the number of killers to rise.
Since the communications routes are out of play, emergency assistants have not been able to receive information from the Donggala regentship, a region north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake at 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a smal bucket on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggla is a regentship stretching over 300 km of the coastal line on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The rainfall, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggla.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is opposite the coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster centre, Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggla was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called arrival in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in the northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake measured 6.8, hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most closely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that brought to the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake, measured 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit Pidie Jaya the regent in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the deadly earthquakes and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the interconnecting buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily beached.
Sarah Palins oldest son aimed at violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested by suspicion of violence in the home, preventing the notification of violence in the home and against arrest, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman's familiar when she tried to report the claimed crime.
Palin is the prison in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was chaired for the court on Saturday, when he declared himself "very clearly not guilty", reports the network.
Palin is intended for three class A infringements that can lead to a prison judgment of up to one year and a fine of $250.000.
He has also been targeted for a class B infringement that can lead to a punishment on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin has been aimed at crimes.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to register the attack.
The case is currently under discussion at Alaskas Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was aimed at violence at home, to prevent the notification of a violent crime at home and to possess weapons in affected condition in the event.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a stroke in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behaviour with PTSD due to his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake on Friday the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit south of the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos circulating that are currently showing where the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami moved to the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to be sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where footsteps and cyclists who arrived in the road were hit down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the chargers must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the deliberation of death penalties in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both of these significances.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a charge of 22 points, under which eight charges were made for murder in the course of gangster activities, which are typically used by public accusators in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "decisive planning and preparations", said the accusators, and described Saipov's execution as "inheritable, evil and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the intentional declaration.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's a decade ago that New York's southern district last traveled in a case of death penalty.
The prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murder of two drug suppliers, but ended with lifelong prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was recently sentenced in a state case in New York in 1953. Then Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for spionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not show any signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he was good with his works.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag up in his hospital room, told the officers.
He has refused guilty of the 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "susually disappointed" about the decision of the accusers.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept an admission and life-long prison without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the chargers not to go after death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians were able to "mark the pressure" of the eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The general conservative parliamentary Member Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom would have "been out now", if Farage had been the Brexit dealer.
May's challenge in relation to the creation of a collection in the deep divided party is stressed by the participation of conservative remains in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep its compromise plan on the track under attack from both brexites, remains and the EU.
Her alliated insists that, despite the reversal, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thus force the eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "caos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihole, Bone announced that he would scratch the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had responsibility, we had been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I'll fight for Brexit, but we're going to scratch Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars for being subject to anyone.
We will decide our own laws in our own country."
Bone refused that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "The British people should have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected in.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a top note to May, she added: "Premier Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the tour that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we don't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must ensure that the political class, which is on the tip of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the people here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-controlled and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour arrival in the midst of the city.
Spreaded activists ventilated with Conservative Mot Brexit-banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis was laughing before the meeting with the security problems of the Conservative Party App.
"They are the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and the technology for Canada, the border controls, the free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's all to laugh.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to set up the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Elizabeth Warren, "is considering strongly to make up the presidential elections" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a city council meeting in Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, has to try to get a return to the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You have wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the council since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she planned to set up the presidential election.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
arrest in the case of shots on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that Friday was arrested a suspect of the shot murder at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooter on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in his head and died of the damage," said police officer Murphy J. Paul according to the media 247 sports.
Wayde attacked to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to be present, in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without trouble and is now in the police in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two meters high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played at an average 17,4 minutes and made 5,6 points and 2,9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment when Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the driver position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight with traffic at the end of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went to the pit one round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when the Ferrari runner, after some bike contact, by means of a double defense on the third turn, had to leave the inland course.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21-year birthday.
Then he led into a large part of the race when in an attempt to a quick end he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go on the 44th round, but could not increase the rate of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did it amazing all the weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me get through.
The team made an amazing piece of work to ensure us both the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump rejected Senator Dianne Feinstein at a voter meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the High Court's Nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sex attacks.
At a electoral meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the witness statement that Ford had given before the American Senate court committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "nothing and dishonest and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are wrath and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who licked it?
Remember her answer... was it you that leaked the document – "Oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I haven't seen anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
If we haven't licked, we haven't licked anything," he added in a simulation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent back the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comene according to the Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done that.
But her refusal was not well received by the president, who at Saturday's election meeting said, "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominated Judge of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of three women's sexual violation, Trump suggested that the Democrats used the accusations to benefit their own case.
"They don't shoot any means in their efforts to take the power back.
You can see the wickedness, the disobediences, they don't care who they're going to drum to get power and control," said the President according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League struggle against Belfast Giants by winning the return battle 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants came quickly in front with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compared at home before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League team for Adam Keefe's team, who came back to hit Dundee 2-1 in Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the pages where Giants went out as victories in the three previous matches.
Dwyer made out for the fourth minute of 3:35 from a assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assist, when Beauvilliers doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In a busy preceding period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownies compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants came in front at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard reconciled with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated in helping Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he guaranteed the victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Flying leaders died to ensure that hundreds of flight passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is sheltered as completely after he died in order to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely coming down on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a larger earthquake in Friday, the Sulawesi island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy descendants still defeat the area, and many are caught in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agungs colleagues escaped for life, he refused to leave his place in the sweating control tower in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He left in his place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was holding the startway, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control Tower because he thought it was gonna crash.
He died later in the hospital.
President of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said, according to the Australian ABC News, that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparations indicate that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to come to them," said the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial flights fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "When minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work every day around to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Fly controlled in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missed after the flight steering in the lagune
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Lagune of the Pacific of Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had been previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the falling plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini says that Saturday afternoon could not find a male passenger.
The airline announced cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not been returned to requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local both helped to save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officers said Friday that seven people were driving in the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers stayed in the hospital for Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the accuracy of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both say that the plane landed in the lagoon front of the landing path.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying by the landing path.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was landing on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits of the falling plane.
He said that the crew paniced and shouted, and he had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. Marine said that sailors who were working to renovate a cage nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ask people in land before the plane fell on about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines during the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his proof on Saturday during the prosecution of a man who was accused of burning a woman living in 2014.
Analytics at the US Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave witness statements for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described for the jury how he used telecommunications to compare the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was close to Chambers' mobile phone at the time he claimed that he and his friend Michael Sanford visited the police Sanford.
Sanford was sitting in the witness crank on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying 'cause my truck was in Nashville'.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at a time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected that the jury would vote later on the same day.
The High Breed: What's political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's girl in New York inquiries pairs for fire with "racist" SMS
A baby girl in New York appeals to a couple for discriminatory fire after being sent a message by a mistake from the mother who complained that she was "now a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the search with "precipitation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed her fear of finding out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEY, NOT ENDNU A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a SMS.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former granddaughter, as from Africa-American, had been bad to her work, and instead she expected a philipine, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice appeals to the parliament to receive compensation for the fire and compensation for 350 dollars a day for the six months in which she should have lived in the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do this," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the fire of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they couldn't trust her after being offended her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been obsessed with, even if it had happened by a mistake?
Your baby?
Honestly."
Plasco compared the search with "precipitation" and that his wife had born two months before and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really looking for someone like that?
This is not particularly kindly done," added the investment adviser.
Although the case is still in progress, the Court of Justice has already declined the parliament on social media and dissuasived their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to release, said about the letter: "It is difficult to imagine to be the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who was working as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired to write the child book about a small clothing bamse, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "bitterbread" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to praise," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it really is not your gain.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was driven to hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors forgively tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you again soon.
See you.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart started, slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the sad Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she went through.
"No one knew it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sucking women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost their relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set cards on a whalelic bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he got a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I endure every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promised cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile shined up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid of it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "telling people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis's many-year-old friend, Kelly Humphrey, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has revoked us from each other.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limited investigation – we might have a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the coma "falled from the hind" in the midst of the unlocked partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican not support the FBI doing their investigation?
Their retention is due to the timing.
The Middle East elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, are bad, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have chosen to the highest judgeship of the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to help them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice-President Mike Pence the decisive voice and choose him to the High Court.
Number of North Korean afhoppers 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean afhoppers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-Seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Cooperation and said there were 1.127 dishes last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park noted that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human sellers were contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given official comments.
In time, most afhoppers from North Korea can offer citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean Government states that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border up to North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the hopes as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is still technically in war – has been significantly improved during the last few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the beached negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic Korea at a general level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US penalties for the lack of progress.
"No trust in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will rest on our own," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to the High Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for High Court Judges, for "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the High Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, it would have been called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate's court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the emotional accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "great and coordinated charity" arranged by the left fleet, who was angered that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not be sitting in the High Court because it showed that he was pre-invited to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went outside when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a Kingdom law if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he doesn't speak true to the Congress or the FBI, he's not suitable for sitting in the High Court, but certainly also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Appeal Court of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions relating to Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the consultations, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he wanted to convert certain previous High Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, pre-inmate person has to fight a job as judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just nice'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, several months of and years of anger that she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss who said she was also crying when she became angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she would say to the one she talked to, "You maybe think I'm sorry because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstanded.
One of my most clear memories is from one of my first jobs in a office with a overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a member of the Congress of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and pulled himself as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could as well set up as a president candidate.
"It wasn't any specially thoughtful decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow-White and the seven dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised that she would not participate unless she collected 2 million dollars.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her support, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought.
When she kept a speech that she wouldn't stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – thankful to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to travel money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a clump in her neck.
"You could think I got a nervous interaction," says Schroeder, how the press responded to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember that I was thinking, what's going to be writing on my grave stone?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be a benefit for Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were high-quality, and even though the battle has passed far from, there can be a long-term benefit for Beijing between countries, says experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing customs duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest eskalation of this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of 200 billion dollars is in principle applicable to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has reimbursed each time, last by placing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's nest largest economy is probably not preliminary.
If it makes Washington withdraw their demands, it means that they give up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it'll be too painful to bow for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war may have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a crude for a economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, researcher with focus on Asia at the thought tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'clear' to receive refugees, believes Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and ask for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were corrected.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working on recreating a normal state.
All the circumstances are now present for the refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic penalties that struck their day and bread of life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have escaped from the country since 2011, where the war began.
Additional six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept contingent aid or aid from countries that contributed to supporting the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and hit the American team 16.5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trofee back when captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached up on the 14,5 points it required to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard at most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pair 3 of 16 holes, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest rated European player, Danish Thorbern Olesen.
No. 1 on the world order list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, which may have played its last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fake to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of having hit Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a fun statistics for one of the best golfers ever won 14 large titles, only surrounded by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had problems with finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing statement: "I'm proud of the boys, because they were fighting for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counterplay.
We lost.
The hatred of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players were really good.
We want to regroup and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will continue.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated."
