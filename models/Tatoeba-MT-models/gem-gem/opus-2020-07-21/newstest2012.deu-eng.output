No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs under a novel of the criminal law, on which the opposition leader of Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regime which could have rejected the way to liberate the arrested Minister for Extreme Affairs, rejected the Members at the second reading of the request for releasing the penalties for economic defects.
Timoshenko was condemned in October due to the conclusion of a claimed disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years' prison.
The judgment is not yet legal, in December the appeal of the condemnants is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko itself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the west, the process raised the suspicion of the court's preliminaryity.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Extreme Affairs was condemned to remove from the criminal law, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of the Libyan Rescue Fight or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is used in this region, it is in the elections of Islamists, the question is just which - the tormented or the radicals.
The National Transition Council confessed to the customs law of the Sharī
Libya would be the country without crime, because for stealing, the hand is shortly hacked off.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any religious deceptions should be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Coran from one another to another.
Shortly – in Libya, a order that would hardly be imaginable to this country and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only and objective one that would probably not be the best one and would hardly fit the alternate Libyans.
So it is rather promising that the Muslim fighters were able to help by the unbelieving dogs at all.
Their excuse may only be the fact that the air attacks of the NATO were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose power was praised after every successful meeting.
The victory in Libya?
We only took part in a change of shot, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians dismissed themselves in the person of the dictator of a political alliance without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a military occupation of Libya.
This causes the crowns to be anxious, namely the distraction of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies, without occupation, get the black gold at the spot price?
It is hardly possible for the West to end with the right of its unselfishness in matters of protection of human rights.
If this doesn't ruin the Sharīa representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focused on investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
Individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
Compared to the pre-quartal, Germany and France, the Czech economy has been suspended.
The obligation market, however, is broken down all records today.
The investors are not only in Greece, but also in the meantime, Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Europe zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany reported a higher growth than originally had been expected (a growth of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the pre-quartal, the gross domestic product, and according to Tsch, the Statistical Office, the trend in the slowing of economic performance was confirmed.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal overestimation, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the entire Eurozone and in the EU, between July and September, the economy reported a growth of 0.2 per cent, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The profits from their 10-year government loans amounted to 28.45%.
The profits of Italian and Spanish government loans increased to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries begin to feel problems...
The return on Czech State bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes will be said that the ECB should become a creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has lost the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-established tower Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great portion of happiness, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious procurement from home game and will once again not miss at the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rising game in a detailed report.
A little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also seized quite happy 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and thus redeemed their ticket for the football EM.
Even because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegriners more pressure until in the second half.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant birds.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be mixed with the European championships next year, and it is also happy that the domestic football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, a lot of fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long and so were played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the time, the pressure of the home crew remained, and the wide offsets from the criminal area were successfully defended by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iran at Isfahan were a living sign on Tuesday around the core technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed.
They wanted to make customers ready to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has not surrounded everything after its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel also speaks of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex on lunch before the entrance and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out in the intent to lay the Iranian nuclear programme largely lame, the Israeli press, from the centre of Isfahan, would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The food card of a fatty child: It doesn't breakfast and eats for the dinner bread Wurst
More than one third of the children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of children overweight.
Current surveys - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows again how important the healthy development of a human is the environment in which it grows up and the examples that surround it.
On the tables of adipous children, worst products are up to half more frequent on the table than in families where normal-weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had pommes to the evening bread on the previous day of the information action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence.
In families with pockers, sport is not just one of the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from basic schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not an accident" supported by the General Hospital Bank and the Unilever Society.
Until now, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes took part in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the terrible increase in the number of children with overweight or even fatigue.
"Only half of the interviewed children, for example, suggested five times a day to eat breakfast-three breakfast breakfast breakfast-fesper evening - one of the main requirements for healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst for dinner bread
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
However, in Czech Republic only 23 percent of the families of the students are breakfasts.
And in most families everyone breakfasts for himself.
The worst was the finding that is not frozen in every tenth family at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test led, among other things, to the day in the families of overweight children, much more frequently unhealthy pommes are consumed.
And almost everybody - without consideration for weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the interviewed children are in sport, only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent.
Collapse your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from offered possibilities in appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Under their favorite meals, many meal meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods were found.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main court, dew goods were victorious just before poultry.
Heavy fruits almost did not like the children, and the popularity of fish and vegetable juices as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are very willing to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"In the control group of respondents who were filled in the questionnaire after the completion of the explanatory lecture "Adipositas is no coincidence", in many cases, a significant shift in preferences to principles of healthy diet was indicated in the results of the project.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to usual water.
The children also crossed much more frequent poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less knees or sweet food.
Profis claims - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had a little painted that this was a little too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Presentations of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problems and a seminar about how the "in place" is running.
It's gonna be worse.
The closer the test comes to the more information and practical tasks we face.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (on course no single man takes part) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the others are one too young figure without ordinary curves and others are molly.
It's the matter of the stylist to cush wide shoulders optical, extend the neck or make the necessary curves.
We also got tips about how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with large buses, broad hips and narrow valley - beautifully and figuratively, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between the valley and the hips is so large that the rock or the pocket really does not fit, you should at least be able to cut a piece by measure.
You're sure you won't regret that, because well siting clothing is simply incurable.
In such a customized rock you feel much better than in one of the stairs, which always stands too high and screwed, in the valley, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow to wear clothes with folds, bouquets, applications, climbing or relief.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let me go thoroughly through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it is almost not to be created in view of the task of the house.
Indeed, each of the students received a promi for which she was supposed to think of suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to dress Miranda Kerr, which you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now well, this is a little overdriven), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothing pieces from magazines or search, print, and then process graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is mentioned, then our entire personal style and our relationship with graphical design will be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styleing.
The styleist attracts the models not only physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (in accordance with a specific standard, for example, trend-handbags, traders, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was drawn by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, by fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And a suitable stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the Jeans, so as a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also wear it on the naked body, dress out a piece of shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to raise the arches or the cranes, and the whole look looks quite different.
"Game with it," he stressed.
But most of them came to me the following advice: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you must hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I will realize why we need to pauke all these doctrines, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
To shut up from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all of this has to be calculated in the design of the outfits.
That image and style are sometimes half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
There you just need to see Madonna, a not just brilliant singer who made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often think this is outcast money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is second-ranging).
And if someone of us can style, we should expect that he or she is likely to force us up a very different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the Boulevard press writes, the promi has reapplied or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just focused on the fashion and then needed the outfit "building".
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he must be a certain psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering and standing to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to view her garments and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't wipe her out and tell her the whole cabinet - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few praiseful things you recommend to what you can wear to it," says Mario.
He also showed us concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must include.
So a pocket that is knocked up at the valley and wear all the necessary proprietors.
Besides such clear things, such as screws, rollers to remove hair or safety nails, it also contains such outensiles as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photographise products, such as pockets or pockets), special clips with which the clothes are drawn backwards if it is too large (climbs or other clamps are prohibited so that the substance is not destroyed) and naturally narrowers.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to get shoes right underclimbed.
Also when photographing in the atelier where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe soles, sweep the outside.
We sticked and we sticked...
You must not even touch the shoes with the shoe so that you can't hurt them.
So you really have to go well.
Mario rejoiced me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not just my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second week's continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate the styling at a professional level, is not a kid's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride is made through a series of completely avoidable dilettant errors for routine travel to the premature layer.
Although the ambitions were achieved largely, what is useful when no one apparently wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the shopboard, the new part woke up with the subtitle "The Run" high expectations.
He promised to move the older "Need for Speed" game series again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed not only to be one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the pastes, in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and walks.
But how you're used at NFS, in the end effect is much different than you've expected.
Safely - possibly, it's quite decent arcade races, but totally the game is smuggled by some overwhelming mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less for a few years.
So there are actually no errors anymore, but rather signs of an in principle inconscious faulity of the players.
The adventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced into history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems personally; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so at the west coast, you're going to run - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that game would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing about the world.
But the journey through the desert, through herbish landscape or high above through deep cut landscape seemed very pleasant.
Sometimes, untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that is strongly restricting the view.
In the mountains, we need to be careful to avoid being shaken by a lawn.
Besides, the individual races are very well built in each other.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you are trying to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (classic race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single contradictor.
And that's why the police are going to intervene, who wants to plumb the whole thing.
A news is passages where Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about some interactive animations in which Jack flees before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button in the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is rather the advantage of the matter, because this element at least has no chance to become boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game varying more.
The driving model runs into the footshots of the previous parts.
That means, from today’s point of view, it does not cut out trees, but it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Whoever is looking for realistic simulations, needs to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded ride will continue to be very good, even though the competition could be better.
Until then, everything's in best order.
Real problems appear only after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it is complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no excitement on any object knowing how the car is doing, then it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: When you pick up closely or prepare for matching cars, you can "strip" in some places the other cars only easily, in others, nearly identical situations, but you get to the sleuder and turn wild piroetes.
Or the car is going to scratch.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter anymore, it's all angry.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the distance.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted her, everything's going out.
So the restarts are rather like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even helps restart, there's nothing other than learning the critical section from the head.
Explicitly unpleasant is that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't pass through.
Otherwise, at the corresponding place of "civil" cars always meet in the same configuration, regardless of whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contradictor comes over before a game of two matching cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes to this situation close to your nose.
The contradictors have more advantages.
Over the whole game there are a few places where you are always overwhelmed by the same opponent in the same place and here again without considering the time.
The most crazy is this to finish the game on the long bridge that is happening in opposite.
It's obvious that the contradictor has to get one out of here on the devil.
And then when he's already before you, he'll take a look, of course, so you can start driving your own car a few times in clump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and more exciting, but this intention is so clear that they avoid you quickly the joy in the game.
And this is harmful, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertainable and in fact also so charged that you almost no longer know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is about it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of races in a way that no longing can come up, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change in cars during the race.
You must not overlook the tanks on the route, because right here you can switch the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient that you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for the urban areas, the strong American limousins for the straight motorways and exotic super-sport cars for technical travel, for example on the Serpentines in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (explanations) - i.e. the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for their own profile, which are common for the tasks (explanations) and the history.
To get to higher driver level, different items must be unlocked: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own results with other players and also provides for more collective functions.
One of other inconscious cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where the car comes into a U-Bahn tunnel (meinetway), where you're running on the rail in the dark (meinetways).
On the tacho seeing numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meinetways), but at one time from the back a U-Bahn and riding a compromiseless to scratch.
In our editorial we're probably going to argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think that we are so foolish.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite attractive in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more angry it is that at some exciting moments, the recurrence of images is slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, the accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where a continuous FPS does not necessitate anyway.
The sound output is as far as OK and the soundtrack is taste case.
In endeavoring to approach as wide as only possible to young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everybody" was created - but who buys such a game for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn't smuggled by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the breastton of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works somewhat unfinished.
For yourself a class pleasure, but you should be prepared to put this error into your eyes with the power of airport signals.

EU Messenger Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the individual institutions feelings out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are smoothed and all have been used to play their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, began quite sharply her speech at the legal faculty.
The seriousness of her taking the motto "conscious and open about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such an overlookable and understandable way that she could have deceived some lecturer of the legal faculty of Karls University.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairmen of the European Council of Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was called to be too obscure - a grey official who hadn't grown such a role, but I have to say it has all swallowed the breath of how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a man who will be ready to patiently listen to seven and twenty Member States, communicate with them and have clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as a response to the question: Who is this, in fact, the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step to agree and improve the readability of EU policies to countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oilmaster Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated himself to the agenda which the European Union lived, living and imagining living in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had undergone the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the Presidency referred to it as a great negative, which has seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of hands.
With the words of the ambassador, it was not only the chair, but also the subsequent crisis that has not been overcome until today.
And there is still a need to approve the Seven Year Budget of the EU, which makes the matter much more complex because of the present economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and spare budget, which sectors will receive priority, which countries are more and less encouraged - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Conscious about Europe."
"If I don't like anything, it's cruel accelerators, foreign words and specialist jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, I should like to know whether we are really crumbing or round grains and various large bananas or whether someone really wants to forbid us the quarel.
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Messengers, the Czech Republic is calling for Euroskeptics to be more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is much more angry.
This is a lot of factors, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is so called V4.
"If you believe me when a pole or a Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak near me, then the French next to me says, "Hey, what do you put your heads together - is this your V4 again?" and thereby makes a pretty sad mice.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects, in particular, hard rules for the budgetary policy of the Member States.
It considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as a "European Federation".
"We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of strengthened cooperation."
"The first time it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those who do not want it should be calm."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will eventually go beyond a strong "Europe of Various Speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters in the second century of his existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM is the most characteristic, this would probably be the word "long life".
For the broad public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, you know it as a modern company, although it has gone a century since it was founded.
The basis for this long-living was already laid on her first boss - the Visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the struggle, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a brand mark to play the life of the future gigantics (and at the same time as the title of the business intern magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the well-prepared business culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thus succeeded in a whole century because it remained faithful to his principles and did not fear of changing everything else.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Transmitted system
Watson has already operated social care in the thirty years of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur in the Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had a vacation paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as working clothing and a thought-to-peaked remuneration system for best newers and dealers.
Similarly, IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are also eliminated.
From the beginning, the company was genial in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised IBM any discrimination - and could thus choose.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is switched to the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been at IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of the driver, marketing and strategy manager.
In recent years, IBM is making so-called online brainstorms, from which many future strategies and innovations develop.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with good reputation
Your unshakable position in the business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning of IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist Professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos because of family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM has most patents and five of his employees have been awarded with the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include banking machines, credit cards, financial swaps, string codes or the floppy.
With about 220 billion dollars of exchange value (market capitalisation) IBM was this year the second largest technology company (even after Apple), which first overcame Microsoft since 1996.
The Look Forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of customers today - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not bind yourself emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, leaving them again.
Unlike the counterplayer Microsoft, who is in principle with its operating system Windows and falls.
Success-promising technologies
In the profits of IBM, services, software and hardware are largely involved in one fifth.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets in value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time fed like a storm over the world.
Here too, IBM remained faithful to his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the major world economy crisis.
Until now, the company IBM seems to overcome the current crisis without damage.
The value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's reintegration has grown constantly.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
That is why it is expected that this flexible Gigant will also master the next crisis.
IBM-History: From cheese cutter to World All-Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago had a pretty complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took her only in 1924 - it was originally a trademark name for a establishment in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later society of IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history has come back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous charts for registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who set the commander of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management of the company.
This Leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today the unquestionable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already declares, began with the manufacture and sale of all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutting up to cushions.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, he doubled their sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was sitting in the headquarters for forty years, only then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM of the NASA flights helped lead into all the flights – to the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of the man to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and went fully into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It represents the intent to use technologies wisely in areas that have not yet been planned, such as improving the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers conduct the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM founded a establishment in the Czechoslovakia, then, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top researcher team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful gentlemen:
Iveta - this donkey can you keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her wife Joseph Rychtář (53) had become a lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink red dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Bartošová had commanded refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have come into the dream of her husband.
When Iveta drove back to her drill after 30 days and went back to جíčany, Joseph went straight away.
Yes, he even knew publicly that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, and it seemed even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not hunt him out."
"Not as a loved, distorted old esel, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," said Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already separated herself emotionally and is alone on mutual prominence.
The fact that Darina has locked him the back door, Joseph has so far beared with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, it doesn't change."
"My wife wants a paper egg and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'm making the purchase."
"I am very normal with Darina, only the bed we just don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to stop it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm aware that this is my fault, I loved Iveta and therefore I take any responsibility.
The worst female distresses: What about you?
If men are invited to call some typical female distresses, they will shake some out of the arch without exception.
Love Women, do you recognise in the following lines, in which we let a few unsite Revue happen again, which let the men wall the blood into the veins?
Purchase
Does their gentle men want to be shopping-sensitive?
Should you buy at least one hater weekly?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a little more for actions?
In your case, then it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust half-way under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman does it already stand to look for a well siting upper clothes just like that by a clothes shop and not likewise try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Think of how often they said to her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Continuous dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I have to take at least five kilos - should I start to jogging or to make gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does that seem known to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are regularly possessed of how they look.
That doesn't mean you should leave, but many men react allergicly to it when their wife constantly mourns over her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequencies of the complaints, women are increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Bunting windows, wheating tiles and dust, shineing the wounds - and this at least twice a week.
Spark with her partner, because he's trampling with dirty shoes again on the clean tiles, you swallowed the kids because the just shot washing basket is awkward again and because the glass door at the living room's cabin has fingerprints again, where you're doing polering so much efforts?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you are not allowed to overdrive anything and the order and cleanness of family life are not the first place.
This measureless purity fume can eventually also harm mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Tiles
"Surfaced towers come into the wash basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a neck to the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't wonder that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, this isn't bad, they just want that everything has his order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not have needed so much to make.
Climbing and tracing
Some women like to climb and scratch, there is tossed behind the back, or even deceived, or one shys bonds.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to hesitate through such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every one of us women have a bit of harmless clam and tranch on camps.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with climbing the most grave calibrators, which are nothing and no sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which are particularly a major danger for women collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the NHL's Monday game with two assistants on the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added a assistant and was called for the best player of the match, was benefiting from the overview of the nine and thirty-year-old Eishockeystar.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists to have Giroux prophesyed a great evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that he's having a hattrick."
I felt that somehow."
"Hin and again overcome such a feeling," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux already reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček struggled behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented him between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second in front of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short hand, but the second third then belonged to the Flyer again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he reached his third meeting, then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the League, but he certainly belongs to the best three," appreciated Jágr his center.
"I wouldn't have imagined that I'm playing with such an Eishockey player as with him at the end of my career."
"That's great for me."
"I cut my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now turns around the spy," jealousy Jágr.
Carolina still made a game to drama - through the meetings of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was carrying out a penalty, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in over-tailing two against one.
"Extremely, Pronger was still acting in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to remote phospoons."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it has succeeded," Voráček described the last meeting of the party from his sight.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defendant of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and dismissed in the second third due to an injury on the upper body.
Besides their experience, the Candiens also bought their leadership a lost in Penalty shoots 2:3.
One of the criminals could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the home team probably pained the high disease-related outcome in the defensive - the game they only played with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we played only with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, we have to be done," said Jacques Martin.
"In each change, one attack wave after the other, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 victory about Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeat, five different guards had share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized public travel offices: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
In particular, the travel offices sold only travels to the socialist eastern block countries, in the west, only elected.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sothi on the Peninsula Krim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a prowestal course, and therefore the travels to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern Block (also the Czechoslovakia) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Even then the travel offices also offered travel to the west, but then they had to buy huge serpents or also overnight in the bed before the travel office, or at least have "good-known" at the travel office.
Even so, the matter had not been running for a long time.
The so-called devisation - the condition for a trip to the west - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to drive the necessary funds (western currency) for a journey to the west.
So most of the Czechs spent their holidays in the countryside, not a wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that persists until today.
The contemporary revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While a vacation in the DDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which you are no longer aware of today, is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the Yugoslavia that day.
As from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the devising obligation was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakes could simply not get enough from their journeys to the west for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus the Czech holidays slept to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation at the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature in foreign travel of Czechs was then a full-packed bag room with conservation, beer and permanent forest, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists could finally buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus the average wages increased, which came into another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, travel agencies began regularly to prepare travels by charter flights after 1997, making flights unfavourable thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, except the United States, had already devisible payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made it easier to travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-all" journey came in 2000, as thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was made to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying in far-earned sunny countries every year; this year you are flying directly from Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czech travels every year in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the Epoch, which marked our "postrevolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitely enrolled our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half their vacation in abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history for a single vacation stay, including the costs at the vacation site, spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head.
The main meeting is to find a new chairman - again threatens a patch.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been chaired and threatens that the follower of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the exceptional main meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is no agreement until today on the electoral system.
And without this, there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, and he had asked his colleagues to find themselves to agree and to find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek, the old crossings between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This showed itself stone and clear on September 16 when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Main Assembly had come to the people's house in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not just the choice itself.
Indeed, it was not even possible to agree on who actually is voting at the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries equipped with a full power.
At least partial agreement was reached in this only point, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Justice, whose opinion was not to take place on a full-member basis.
However, the disputes about the electoral system continue to persist.
The Executive Committee also did not clarify the matter in which meetings - regardless of whether ordinary or exceptional - are in principle no more on the agenda.
Although the opinions on the elections changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to go in the third round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The issue concerns whether to act in accordance with the Statute or whether a completely different model should be found," Dušan Soboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to a statutory model, in the third round of the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is candidate.
Marriage is claimed to be willing to take into account the compromise that the candidate is seen who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
On the other hand, the Czech side is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one third majority in this percentage of vote.
"Then the two front rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-room concept," soboda understands the objections of the maurian side, which best it might not add the election order, but according to a valid statute.
It is surprisingly agreeing to Tomáš Paclík, even if it concludes that the statutory election order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that mostly elected after the statute."
"In order not to be thought of any malicious replacement variants, as in the last main meeting," the owner (the football club) explained Victoria Plze's first candidate and in its opinions, especially with regard to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion is to be known in Nymburk by the new Chairman and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly contribute to the rest of the minds."
"If the football runs on the euphoric wave only, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," the functionary of Jablonec, which brings the biggest experience from all three adopters, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more backholding.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is tangible."
"This isn't a matter between the people from bohemians and mowers, but there are some efforts to "adjust the rules for their own purposes"."
"That is why a re-blocking of the main meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human understanding finally wins," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to play directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, including Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, could not start to Podgorice in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, so they were looking feverly for a replacement variant, such as to bring a part of the executive committee to the location of the Barrage Hinplay.
Lastly, the meeting at Minister level is certainly crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the divided parties within the largest sports union of the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state applications, the credibility of the Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the ČSTV, which will guide the Czech sports to the new direction of the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the position of the Chairman because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the boss of Pilsner footballers before the exceptional main assembly, could have been a strong candidate, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association (FAČR), he wouldn't have put himself in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good advocate, I would fight for him and fail to choose."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the claimed favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the case of his victory he intends to exercise the function of the chairman only one year, that is until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced top manager who was not too much cracked into the football events.
"With some people in question, I have spoken personally."
"Now to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football at present.
"These views would like to be changed," he pointed out.
Most of all, Paclík claims to disturb Pelta's connection with the president of the Pilsner County Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, which is considered to be a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main meetings.
For Paclik, it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had the position of the chairman.
"In his victory the state of today would conserve and in the Czech football it wouldn't go forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, got twice bad on the football," stressed Paclik.
He also argues that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with telephone hearings for detecting in a corruption affaire, but from which Pelta was punishment.
"I don't know what Prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the (e.g.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta president," but sees something more left.
However, if Paclík is seen in the Thursday election, he can present a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the main meeting in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great capabilities."
"I could imagine him, for example, as a head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclík, who had taken care of this in September, that he had replaced the Dagmar Damková after the appointment of the Vice-President Commission.
Paclík itself claims that he feels the role of the Chairman of the Association.
And calls for his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which celebrated the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and procedural commissions, which is indispensable in disadvantaged situations," said Paclík, who does not make a hole from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with the help of which he would lobby with the political top politicians that more money flows from lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new Chairman should devote to."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they also have to say rock and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not also regard Paclík as a handicap, although he itself emphasizes, the Chairman of the FAČR must be "overpartial".
Pelta is reversely connected to Mallarec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"It also does not make much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Club to a third party to return after another half years," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which release a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised he will make himself strong in the case of his choice that the FAČR will receive new statutes which will exclude disputes about the pre-selection order in the future.
The Jablonec functioner is convinced before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the electoral struggle will be safely eliminated in the possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to concentrate in the case of his choice on the national team and the acquisition of funds.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, and so he liked to help the two-month break to defend his ideas about the management of the football and to present in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is guided by someone, the man who is primarily connected with the Mallarec club, but also acted many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the elections are the euphoria, which was dominated at Ivan Hašek's time.
"Leders were approved at the main meeting in June statutes that were not as perfect as they had all accepted.
If they weren't allowed different interpretations, we had had a chairman since September," said Pelta.
Just the revision of the main document of the civil association he used as locking agent for the delegates.
"If I should be chairman, then I accept it personally and will be prepared to carry personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a principal thing that he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his contradictors.
He had already announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises for his legal education and he knows well that his contradictor was his first representative.
Tomáš Paclík has not been attacking for a long time, which in turn did not leave dry threads on Pelta.
In the football, he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"Their attacks were decreasing, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore many now doubt his real character," addressed Pelta his contradictor, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he has said in September.
His opinion is that his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this should be the covering sign of Czech footballs.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the afterhalls of the corruption scandal from the last year."
"I would like to start negotiating with the private and state sector in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the sixty-four-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I should only know the content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchie understandably has nervousness.
Despite the contemporary catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the present main meeting, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk by no means on Thursday.
"If we really should be the only violent point, as you choose in the third round, we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins by it when he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possible decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the previous vice-president Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as a new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association on Thursday, many people in the association claim that this would avoid the sound.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice you start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work started by the former Chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As Chairman, I want to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, the professional football, to the performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'll distribute hard tasks so that the football gets forward in every segment with miles."
Many would not just be pleased because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working hardly themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, we have considered that we should no longer know.
"From me I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw me unreasonable knee between the legs and question any step I do," he said as an explanation why he was being delayed.
"But many people told me that I couldn't give up because otherwise it would do others."
"It's trust that you can't play," he said.
It is apparent that he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great piece of work and I don't just want to throw that away."
"There have been started processes that may only come into force within a few years and I would only be disgraceful to see that they stop someone," he said, and thus expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach and that is something Mirek Pelta does not bring."
"It's not all that he's got people who would make the football so that he'd only be there for elected."
I guess you can imagine something, but not that I would be party."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone's good and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for mice."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the League into a Czech and an ancient part, whose winners then went up to the first League each."
"Then it could not happen that today only three maritime clubs play in the League, which is especially a problem for the young players in mieren," says Rajchl.
Since the chief of Pilsner Clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl is not trusting to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, who elected me to her vice-president and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl pointed out, who also considers the saving of twenty million crowns for improper contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty that the association does not draw on a single strike.
While he says of Pelta, "he has been disqualified from the front to help the Czech football to rely," he thinks the second rival - Paclík is a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in only one year."
"If he should be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He would surely not want to beat things to his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into blue
By Julia Stanek
Plant basin in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracles - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went to research trips over the last half of the years, one could not miss in her bag: her bathroom suit.
Backling on the water, she looked high in artificially designed couples, swimming against marble pockets waiting at the edge of the beach, and surprised them over acrybianly restored youth style swimming pools.
If she found a bath, she took it in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her just published book "Badefreuden": Volkszwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "road to the most outstanding baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathroom culture enthusiastic.
With sport, she doesn't have much hate, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Wrongly, swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while jogger can breathe the devastating fragrance of fiery forests or listen to a joyful bird twitter in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools really always have to be so horrible," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"I started to gather beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled Architecture
Platforms in the jumping basin and etheric sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, so Meder.
And if the builders have made effort, swimming halls can be a true eyeblow: "Site of a soil you have a water surface in baths."
"It is, on the one hand, transparent, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optical: high wools, bunted tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format video tape "Badefeeds" provides 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and culture history of historical wellness oases - but especially desires to jump into the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
Besides beautiful cure baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a dirty cart cave (holenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated free baths in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zuricher Dachbad has the entire city in the eye, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outer pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the drive on the ski park.
The most extraordinary swimming pool design expects bath guests in long-term field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upwards open shells it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal fall into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine rose to the nose.
Many thermal baths smell for sulphur, in the Anrpad-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly for heat oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing cure water that is almost black and its squeak sticks to the skin as soon as you can glide into the basket - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech bathroom Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bath, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, was now closed.
When the Meder threw a look through the wiped windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw as unclean between the tiles grew.
On the other hand, there was a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three building phases have already been behind this bath; not only neoromanic elements can be discovered from times of its construction in 1844, but also a maurical hall in the Alhambra style, which was added at 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of Iris Meder pool expert - not only because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge so different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the diving walk in the thermal pool seems only to be a bit more.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw materials businesses to be lighted through
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
After SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann has assigned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the Conzernchef then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the German bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it worsens the problems of the world's worst.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in the middle of October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global raw stocks increase prices - and therefore the banks have a co-debt in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
However, most experts agree that the sugars have disconnected from the supply and demand - and at the cost of making the worst profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to examine the claims and said that no business is worth "to put the good reputation of the German Bank on the game".
According to information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently checking the claims from the Foodwatch report.
The review will be completed by the end of the year and the results will be presented to the Governing Board of the German Bank, as well as to recommend how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's peak will then tell what consequences it takes.
At the end, a reduction of the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann bastards on his image
Foodwatch-Chef Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism in the financial sector: "The bets at rising prices of food are particularly drastic to show how inconvenienceless banks in general hurt today."
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as a top bank lobbyist.
"The German Bank has to eliminate all installations from its portfolio where money is spent on food prices," said Bode.
"If Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the call of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprisingly on the first view, but it is clear that the Conzernchef wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Governing Board will not change to the Board of Supervisors differently than planned.
With a return from the controversial agricultural population, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible infusions, he hardly needs to shake himself - that would eventually have to do his follower.
Each second would cancel raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore just 11 per cent that the Deutsche Bank is legitimate to offer plants in which prices for food are paid.
Many banking customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would cancel the survey all installations where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would decline from such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Wien
The Pavillon Trailed
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture story with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels in 1958 reached prices, was a museum in Vienna, stood empty and sold.
Now he's being reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern after-war architecture is heated, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, typical for the faith in technical progress, the Austrian pavillon of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a fine and famous example for the Bressler World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzer Pavillon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The building is currently considered as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so known that it was also built at the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
In 1973 he became internationally famous with his legendary BMW-Viercillinerhaus plus a shoe-larged subconstruction in Munich.
His pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition construction was set up, converted and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century, after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden. It was called the 20th House.
But the building was not suitable spatial and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, he is now called "21 house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a happiness in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who was new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has completed the restart.
Husslein-Arco, promovated art historian with a considerable career, including in the youth as an ice-art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made the reconstruction of politicians and monumental guardians, acquired public funds and private sponsor funds and established the use.
Apart from present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same named foundation, a café and a book store should be provided, and a office house had to be built.
Strengthened supervision, small ethics
For the implementation, then Crisianitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna was sensitively converted and expanded and won competition, but because he studied at the Swisser University of Vienna's Technical University and the Pavillon was a "unprecedential place" in which he had viewed the exhibitions "at least every weekend".
He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building that lost during his transfer to Vienna and his reuse to generosity and lightness.
There were far greater problems during the current conversion: the building was "a energy sludge," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fibers were exchanged, glass faservered isolation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled tyres have been cleaned.
Two subheadings brought space for the new use, a lowered light grave between house and street provides the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light swear pavilion.
The original outdoors have remained, the house has been deleted in the old red brown roast protection colour.
And the cinema is even quite the same as it was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with a little etat.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also enjoyed the monumental protection office," says Krischanitz and pointed to a rubbish soil in the underground.
Despite all forces, problems and reconstructions, the building is flexible and easy remained.
It would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "wear a real consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not at the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building happiness: around the Swiss garden is just the completely newly planned "Main Stationsquartier", with office and housing houses.
And another happiness may occur: The 21s house could get reinforcement from another Crischanitz-Bau, because the Sammler Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and, as you hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plant Winter-Krisen-Paket in million height
The train has a crisis plan to prevent train losses in winter.
The number of employees will be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train losses and delays, the German rails report reports more than 70 million euros this year.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance on a group-internal crisis plan, until 2015, investments of around EUR 300 million were planned.
This was intended to achieve a better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
It is planned, among other things, to double internal and external employees for snow removal on railways and railways to 16,000 persons.
The aim is to free rails from snow and ice until the start of the operation and 90 percent of the required softs within four to five hours.
Two months ago, rail-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned at a top meeting with government and industry against train accidents and delays in this winter.
Last winter, the rails in passenger traffic had considerable problems, as it lacks reserves, among other things under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the railway alliance for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to make ICE trains check a lot more frequently in the workshop after a ICE had a axis break in the Cologne main railway station.
German Bank pays millions of punishments in the United States
After the tumult around Chief Joseph Ackermann, a new injury comes from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems weren't already enough for the German Bank, the industry giant is now getting into the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to the issue of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of hypotheses.
The financial market regulator NCUA suggests a whole range of large banks that the cooperative banks with false promises on the purchase of financial products had declined the risks.
Such papers lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and the banks are in the depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the subject without having to move the parties before court," said a German-Bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not blame for the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to the payment of $2.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the reconciliation of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Association Banks and jumps in to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the resulting billions of harmful damages replaced.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their types.
The regulator had also punished other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The relevant hypothesis is so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on household credits.
When the U.S. Immobile blossom was placed in 2007, this became a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers killed.
Even though the events have been back for a few years, the banks are currently putting a sharp wind against the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have struggled with countless complaints in order to obtain repayment or infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complaint.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have overwhelmed the two state-wide US-mobile financer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in hypothesis transactions in the volume of around $200 billion.
The German Bank must also complain about the FHFA, here are several businesses in total of $14.2 billion from the years 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurter to stand straight for "substance losses", but without calling a precise sum.
The German Bank had rejected the claims as inconsistent and declared to want to reject.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in IT companies IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of companies is only badly forecasting.
Now, however, he read the business reports of IBM and changed his view of investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM was offering services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a rider in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM can now call himself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US Economy Sender CNBC that he has purchased $10.7 billion since March IBM shares.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus increased to one of the largest shareholders of IBM by a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the engagement.
He commended the management that even in the economic crisis had still provided for ordinary gains.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
IBM has been putting on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for a period of time.
The over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had prevented technology companies from the date.
He says he's only investing in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett was admitted to a carriage train, with a butterfly manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
Besides around 80 own subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with smart investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cultural figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unfair sense of money has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment has been announced, the IBM action increased by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also mentioned, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange and counts together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to get in.
The founder of Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is gripping
Following the discovery of the "Twickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German legal state.
A newspaper speaks even of a "bloody ideology", which is now resurrecting.
The murders of eight Turkish members and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme legal background.
This news will be reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German-dryers, there is a long-term dead-good spirit: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable violence with the right-extremised background more against Turks.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany, nevertheless, was questioned.
However, the evident right-extremist network reveals the size of which has not been seen yet.
"Relives the bloody ideology?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper stresses that one of the actors should have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the judicial sump.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted: in the weekend, with a Mahnwache before the Brandenburg gate, she reminded the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a festival of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish application agreement.
In joyful colors, it had been focused on each other as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media works like an ear feast: "Tyskland's gift to the fifty" is the headline of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" can also not be taken to draw this thankful connection.
"It begins to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed the fact that people were murdered, the taxes paid and with their work had contributed an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the action of the police is very critical and the results of the flags are discussed later.
Why the German authorities had not already felt much more about looking for suspiciouss in legal extreme circles, the authors are surprised.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to be slammed here, the immigrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
"That'll be the best self-protect."
"From the goodness of the explanation and suitability of the punishment of the entire network, the inner peace in Germany depends very strongly," says "Selen".
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the ninety years revealed.
The photo of Solingen's firelines is deeply enclosed in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turkish living here more clearly that there is a fatigue threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can be incurred in right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the We-Feel on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past errors
In the Turkish press then, especially the failure of German politics was affected after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a compassionate picture to the Turkish presidents, but he was represented at the sad feast in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then recorded in his speech how many charges the present Turks made.
Likewise, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German towers has been in this state of law since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and re-evaluation of legal extreme terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventureous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt into the financial crisis and has been climbing from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
Axel Weber wouldn't have thought that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Federal Bank, it was announced in July that he would reach a nearly the same spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS, a unexpected and luxurious career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland of its beauty and the UBS of its newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the tournament."
"I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had surrounded all the bank security systems and softened around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President-in-Office of the UBS has also regarded it as an attack - and all questions: When is the end of Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber may consult the bank from February 2012.
And the chairman of the Administrative Board, he is already taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, rather economic professor and emergency bankers and would certainly have had a time of entry into service.
With a hit, he takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it earns the title "the largest scandal bank of Europe" for a long time.
Because the UBS is, on the one hand, huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and has been slinging from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, so it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank remains saved.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the swayed and solid but also extruded Swiss asset managers had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed more money of funded customers with $1.6 billion than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she was a investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world.
That impressed.
The only banker and later long-term bank professor in Zürich Hans Geiger tells us, "My students always put the UBS as a model of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, you're wondering, how could I just mislead myself?"
He was really wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was evident that something related was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, head of board Peter Wuffli came back surprisingly, who was considered a high-intellectual and also a genial banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had gone.
The bank's investment firms had succumbed subprime papers and had to describe billions.
In order to train this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of sage and writes 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who would have surrounded the nose until recently: a transparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so diminished that one did not even know his name.
But that was only the first battle.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President-in-Office of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, still the second-paid Swiss Administrative Board, returned in 2006.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: The UBS was in the face of its failure to invest in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Eidgenossenschaft gave six billion francs for a forced change loan that it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet sum in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic performance (see Graphics).
"Now we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months afterwards, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared himself willing to issue the data of qualifying customers who possibly had reduced taxes using the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses, as well as a penalty.
This helped the UBS to help reduce taxes more or less openly.
At the same time, she lost something that had been their capital since ever in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of diversity.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chairman and President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: the investment banking through the misspeculations and the asset management by means of tax deduction.
And just when it became a little quieter again, just as you thought, the UBS will get it back now, then this inevitable dealer story follows: a single dealer sucks EUR 1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is wrong.
And it will be obvious: Risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"In the case of Adoboli, you have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economy and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of Zurich University.
The financial leadership of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It had been exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had come to be guards of the great assets of the world a long time ago: no too high risks of security for money - could also break the world alongside the Alps Republic once.
The Tresore of the Swiss Banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich is still suitable for the clinic of the Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which is directed from the main station to the Zürich Sea, which is embraced by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Juwelers like Tiffany's are found here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have traveled here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS's reception hall is joined by a heavy turn door.
Inside the walls are marbled, there is a thick leather seat in front of the bank logo a large sign of "Safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has disappeared both Switzerland's large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at any time - or betrayed how the boss of a small Switzerland private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also makes business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the angels' axis had also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they've been adapting to the seats of the angels' axes for long."
Actually, it was the Angelsaxian Investment Banking that changed the UBS, only made its high profits and then the Debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about EUR 45 billion, politicians authorised to save the big bank in front of the bankrotte.
How could it come?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Switzerland large banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too large at the merger for the small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
This helped the two different precursor banks of the UBS supplemented: a rich but sleeping bank with the focus of assets management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came favorably to a lot of money with which they could rotate a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Concertef of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Management Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, understanding a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach-man who worked up from the banking doctrine to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli at the end probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that overmood came before the case.
Employees of the UBS recall clearly the leadership meetings on which Conzernchef Wuffli repeated the same parole: Goldman Sachs runs from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
She directed the "League Tables" which documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps you've been lucky.
In the devising business and in the stock trade, she played all the way up.
However, business advisers who were ordered raised a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American hypothesis products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that she cost almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both invested the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American hypothesis credits and furthered - but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were long looking for the exit.
"Now in summer 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts were to be cleared more difficult than expected.
Posts at the UBS have become a swallow seat and are still wakeful.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a nearly impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has managed all the related business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already an idea: end with the investment banking, concentration to the assets management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (now) to that extent.
But the investment banking is to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors.
In the meantime, he has carried out: he is intended to manage permanently the UBS businesses, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to the stand at the middle of the ninety years.
It's 3500 places.
But this will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to do for money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask.
Openly, he only says so far, he will first search for a apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US exchanges
The threatening recession in Europe has couraged the US investors for the week-up.
The change in government in Athens and Rome remained without striking force.
The threatened industrial production on the continent boasted the hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the Keim.
The general facilitation of the change in government in Rome and Athens was not possible.
The euro fell over the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass remained half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems were raised again, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial values were on the sales tables.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values noted for trading closure with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is depressed at the end of the rise.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat statistical office announced.
The US investors voted skeptically: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman by Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to release itself from a recession as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment-learning Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early from his view to investing in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett was thrown a decade of old principle about the hips and increased into the U.S. technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional group's share rate and allowed it to note a percentage higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187,35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece according to its own data and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 per cent.

The share won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of his history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 longitudinal machines of type 777 on Sunday and counted the value of orders to $18 billion.

719 values added, 2281 gave after and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, in turnovers of 1.38 billion shares 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 were unchanged.
Intelligent cranes spread in cities
Many scared seed cranes are considered "problem birds": but from the cities the high-intendent animals are no longer displaced, claiming experts.
The one likes them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crowns have been part of the city image for centuries, but in many municipalities, inhabitants are exposed to dreck and noise of animals.
This means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed cranes were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crown symposium in the East Freeze Empire.
There specialists from the entire federal territory will offer possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural guardians also led the problems in cities to the aerodrome of the particularly protected seed cranes: the chemical use in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical bread trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crowns are under nature protection.
Great colonies with more than 600 breeze pairs are found in the western Falish Soest, in the northwest, among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen, as well as in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for mass killing crowns in the district had provided for negative lines.
Critics had called the catching of the animals in birdfalls and the killing with knobs as particularly brutal.
"The normal explosion, which commits, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found from empty.
Besides spraying water or falling trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals wipe out, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Irritation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, older homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities will not be solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said from empty.
It is possible to be a combination of crushing the animals from sensitive living areas and locking offers to resettle them at other places.
On the other hand, "Infect tables instead of chain saws" were the psychologists and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a whole other dealing with the animals: "A pocket in the face we can finally be able to endure the best self-conscious."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, which informs the signs of the life of the high-intelligent seed cranes.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Jürgens had his own opinion as to criticism of the bird's noise: "There is a lot of communications that have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed cranes use not only tools to get to a delicious beet, but also make their tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed cranes, how far the intelligence of birds is.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a noise to the crash to reach a mottenlarve.
Without much training, they targeted the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the piffy cranes had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small nipple with a mottenlarve.
With the snavel, the birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wire pieces.
Of this, all four animals formed a cook, with the help of which they then climbed the clay on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed cranes even came to this point.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the European Championship in 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the Playoffs.
Following the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8, 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Hercegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in a successive manner perfect after the 0:0.
The Czechs made a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off game at outside Montenegro after the Hinspiele (2:0) had been a clear thing.
There was no more burning in Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a lessener 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Hero Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) reached the further meetings for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-rode map (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the Play-offs to the WM 2010 in South Africa to Portugal.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a start in measure.
Ronaldo hunted a free-shot of about 30 metres for early lead into the masques.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed its wide-shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by Torjager Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the Latte, but the ball did not cross the gateline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Vice-President Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the centre.
After an attack against Hero Postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, Stark decided to swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow map (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action of Fabio Coentrao, which was safely transformed by Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
In 1976, the European Chairman will be accompanying the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of trainer Michal Bilek with the Federal Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nürnberg) had also happiness and had to survive a horror in the beginning phase.
Endman Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turning from the penalty border just near the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crosslet had to save for the already hit the world class tower of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had declined (50.).
The gate finally made everything clear shortly before the end.
Turkey therefore missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink has to put its place on the WM third bank of 2002, the Croatians may enjoy their fourth participation in an EM ending.
Before 31,000 at the Maxsimir city, the Turks had almost taken a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distant shot only the phosphor, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even lower the craper in the gate.
After the horror, however, Croatia was increasingly controlling.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, which took place from the 62th minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Federal Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Draft Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni is driving to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trapattoni trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken a pre-decision with the 4:0 success in the backplay in the 32th minute in the leadership.
Constantine Vassiljev (57.) matched for the guests.
Ireland pushed from the beginning to the speed, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian refugee prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was so far.
After a disadvantaged defense of finale Pavel Londak, Ward was at the place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to double the number of his employees in the country nearly.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (approximately EUR 1.5 billion) were reported by the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set employees accordingly," said Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
The employees are to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of establishments of the world market leader for company software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Peking, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fearing. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen destiny halls" begins with a long list of main people who go to heart.
Here you can see how you can do this: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
They will know these people very well in Englund's romantic story. And these main persons will function as your GPS, as a light tower in these few moments, where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fool of the war and rubbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of the anti-story".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battle. There are hardly ambassadors, rage reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feeling, impression, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconvenient men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbs, doctors, nurses and office workers.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some get to war prisoners, lose leather sizes, become crazy or die.
Everyone of these lives looks like the Votivkers in a church, some come to, while others delete.
Enlund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" walks with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall to bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flying is an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war overflows the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurrikan Katrina, who smells for Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears canon fire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Never anybody understands what happens or why this war is carried out at all.
"Failing facts," says Enlund, "has been furnished with suspects, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stomp, a young German shipmater.
Their stories were mostly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports may be terrible or exciting, but they are extremely vivid in Englunds of the loss of small moments in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "Replace, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radier rubber, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more about replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Flesh made of pressed rice and baked in Hammel fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes covered with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food replacements allowed in the manufacture of worsts, 511 registered coffee replacements."
Some stories are dealing with honor and braveness.
A American recognises his own desire to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was rather intended for men than sitting in the lender chair, with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do that than meant such a fassade civilization and as if there was no barbary behind its own strengthened and complained shirt breast."
Reversely, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and will not take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a distance from the thought of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in the secret."
Other observations are related to the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict became increasingly a economic competition," says Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the constituent of the still young century," "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a measure that slaughtered while sitting behind a desk."
Humans act unforeseenly and there is just as freely behavior as heroism.
The soldiers who actively tried to put themselves in a prostitute with a sex disease in order to escape the front service.
"The huge expression of it can be discovered in the trade with gonococket eggs, because soldiers bought and smuggled on their genitals in hope to come to the hospital," he writes.
"They who were really desperate, threw him into the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes shy and yet unreasonable and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In thousands of small scenes, he starts the way that the war "refused uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start wondering why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were usually more fake like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional roaming hall.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's as if he, with his book, took us this page away with the main persons in front of the nose and kicked up with a timber.
After a early failure, a minutious planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in carrying some of them in service helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others believed first to participate in a exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Desernat, and the householders had a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by watching how occupations were managed in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on the Manhattan site of the East River.
The command to get into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, what a declaration was called "exercise".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for the secretary was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to leave the park, but then returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including operating commands from the whole city - hundreds of mobile officials, usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that throughout the day, many people go in and out into the park, almost like pendlers, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were available before departure at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-record news that threw from the speakers seemed to be intimidating many protesters.
When the public officials ended in their bright blue wind jackets in the park, many protesters simply raped their things together and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be handled until 1:45 a.m. to give the protester time to pack up their possession and good.
Other teams of officials have been seen how they collected in the area to intervene, should be required arrests in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists argue that they were trying to prevent them from watching the police action in the park, and they said that the dealing with the officials had been very raw.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great interference with the personal things of the protesters, including bags, artificial grasses and clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been lifted up, which had been left.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located close to the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park Position.
Some created barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp banded together with their arms.
And two people chain themselves on trees, said Mr Kelly.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The rumor was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police's statements.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, as he said, resulted in "inappropriate behaviour and resistance to a arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformized official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was there too.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "not the operation", as Mr Browne said.
In case of access, a second group of officials on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street, waited.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was possible to observe how these locations from the police expanded the surroundings around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive outside people.
About 28 people were in the northern circuit.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the deck of a police bus.
In one place, the quantity threw a piece of lockhole.
At the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Maintainer's trade union will complain against the city for releases
The trade union, the hundreds of school managers who have lost their job last month, plans to complain to the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their unpleasant influence on the schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility of the trade union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the releases.
Six hundred and seventy school helpers, care coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid employees of the city and lost their work on a shock on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for the refusal of access to a health fund undertaken by the working groups last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, last month, the dismisses were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that the budget does not specify that staff of school aid would be released.
Officers of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the complaint is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will lead Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as prosecutor and will count eight unleavened workers as a complainant, who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city is not in charge of the complaint and that is why their individual claims could not be commented.
According to a complaint which is available by the New York Times, the trade union has concentrated on the number of releases at schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools had lost more helpers as they were chronicly underfined.
She suggests that while there were no releases in State Island and only few releases in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers in 23 districts in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx were released.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school helpers who were employed at the public school of 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighbourhood of occupied parents who can organize donations to capture budget shortages."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each arms school subscription.
The trade union also complains that the heads of the High Schools were guided by the language in a memo into the error, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually describes the exchange of a teacher from the paylist of a school to a pool of workers available to be paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators of care were released, not overwhelmed," says the draft complaint.
Mission finished, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Finally, it seems like Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already admitting to the rebellions in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-year dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate shall decide on a resolution which is subject to the Chairman of John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libyen for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of two parties' democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was simple in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawyers of both parties and the White House argued about the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or disappoint the role of the US Military in the Libya mission of the NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day this law fell through in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission came into a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that was admitted enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to definitely move the ground under the feet.
Then the uncongress’s uncertainty was overcome by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "Congratulates Libya's people on their huge courage and their exceptional persistence in their self-release" and "pries the men and women of the U.S. Military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Board of Foreign Relations or will they split the legislators as the June Act did?
The last version is based on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that requires a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congress-legislatur period of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or of another area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried to bring their changes to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte change is only one of 68 constitutional changes submitted to this congress and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to the Congress and to the Senate - others are just a little apart from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget change alone and another dozen that would "control the federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - in particular beginners of the Republicans who want to politate their lifetime - the possibility to praise that they have such an action "designed".
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be laid down by members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids a marriage under equal sex is just as a change that forbids the burning of flags is a always repeating template.
Some legislators also want to allow the suspension of federal laws when two-thirds of the States reject them.
As zealously as Members propose changes, they are moving as faster as in the past years.
In the 111th Congress, lawyers submitted 77 such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
The rate remains in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, the figures provided by the Senats Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment which has been added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Found but not defeated," says Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man had shot on her from the next distance during a election event in Tucson, the Republicanist Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) on Monday night in the national television. She alone sang to the Broadway block "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that to return to the Congress.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC messages "20/20", she graduated by words and needed help in walking.
The consignment showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the ball, which divided its skull, drilled the left side of her brain and crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the congress to triumphate her voice to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were hurt, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their healing as "tough".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the Astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special is pursuing Gifford's healing since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with cold racing head and a long shell over the head.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
months later, Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how they perform simple movements.
A nick with your head.
A token with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' healing: You can see the congress members singing together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with treatment, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read a article of a day newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Jared Lee Loughner is a defensive protector in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heart, Heart, Heart."
During the healing of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back more than ever before.
Trups feel more compassionate than respect
The event was a Wall Street Galla that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On one label, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount of black smoking stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A chief military officer on the Gala, which was observed among other things by the Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like male kids," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was compassion.
The crushing contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its prize, says servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you do people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victim," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way of support is to press us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear in disturbance or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the repentant troops struck against the last years of Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battle with the marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of awesome fear, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "worn, violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a raised state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondent wondered subtlely whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in war.
Services on the battlefield are taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees only few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely as praise.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was quite usual in the Second World War," said Luitenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a servant.
Trups find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or for the seriousness of their injuries.
Military is the growing pressure for the harsh surgery of rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of a rape before the military court because of non-interference.
If this is not the case, hundreds of complainants are ready for the next hearing.
Upper-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier in the night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her boxes in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he should accompany them for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanian wiped their concerns on the side.
I thought, "Ah what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my abdominal feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man went behind her, pressed her down and wrought her, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military officers are afraid of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it decides whether a complaint which they have received against the former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be approved before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and spacefield have not been committed against the widespread rape within the military and under infringement of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., submitted the complaint included at the beginning 17 complainants, which grew up to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who allegedly claimed that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or to provide a proper judgment according to the supposed attacks.
Burke says they are pursuing the highest military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of recompensation? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Your Strategy: Instead of all the applicants to put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Defence Ministry, chaired by state prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are available in Newsweek, take the defence strategy in detail, primarily that the military cannot be charged by the present or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come into the forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are incurred in the active service of soldiers.
The document states: "The discriminatory damage occurred during the military service of the complainant.
The Defence Ministry refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the battle, the difference is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers, two thirds of them died in battle actions.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not there alone in her struggle: three more complaints except her are attached.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four major military academys for the misrepresentation of a woman's enemy atmosphere.
Independently, Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which it is focused on the diagnosis of "Personal Disturbance", the rape victims received to release them from the service - a usual approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group complained against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the War Veterans) in which she was proposing her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to the Congress, independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of points of reference.
2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) of the Defense Ministry of 3.158 sexual abuses were shown.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the own estimate of the pentagon, this number takes account of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in March also examines the persecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases covered came in the military before the court, only half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in Burke case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the absurd rape of the military police less than one hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before attack with her friend.
Six people expressed themselves as character witnesses in the name of the discouraged acter, who was finally released.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wounds would take place, and I ran out of the court hall.
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commissioner, "It wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incompatible.
In January 2010, she was unfairly released, so that she could not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other complainants have made progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of legal science at the George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he notes, "I think they should come forward."
What is between them and a judgement is this doctrine, which is criticized since it has been questioned for the first time.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military hangs a decade afterwards, because they do not have the same incentive and the same termination that brings a liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them, but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with her hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers you watch on Facebook
Before he became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-migration plan online.
On Monday, Breivik, who said to have been in a amboc run in Norway in July, when 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far not alone in the Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and has chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-extreme groups on sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report from the British Ideographer DEMOS on digital population in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaetic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the advertising tool on the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been for many years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans right-extreme groups across Europe and then showed them with adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, adds users invited to a survey in which they were asked for their educational status, their attitude toward violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10.000 attendants of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without only once leaving their office.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online supporters right-extremer groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "the ones who combine their online activity with a offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideal factories, medical researchers and policy scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding averagely three content per day, Facebooks "datasupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title of the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually do not reach with its clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and never had given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full-suite on Facebook are significantly more prone to drink problems than students who dwell on this topic.
Moreno suggests that similar students, for example living advisers, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Child's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify vulnerable children that would otherwise not be found."
Facebook is also constantly absorbing the data of his own population.
The page's data team has produced statistics on relation status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the intermediate elections 2010 and a national happiness index (which has been used primarily information on which only Facebook has access - Master of digital freedom has long known that the site should make its large data founding available for others for research purposes).
But the users of Facebook know that the page they observes whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you can provide your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey from which they don't even know anything yet?
While researchers have strictly defined directives how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"It was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years, Selwyn as a technology researcher thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok runs, with which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" struggler.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Temple Rite of Norway," he said before a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection to the court, since you have received your mandate from organisations that support hatsideology and thus support multiculturalism."
"I admit the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he did not want to give Brivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a prescribed speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik kept in investigation for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will check all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and riegel.
All took part in the goal that everything runs out of a way.
"I thought he worked cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspects."
Breivik had a dark dress and a blue crochet and worked quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had complicated.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compare him with Henry Ford and thereby evolving the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple-Fans might find the most enthusiastic job interview recently discovered, which has been created this week before special film presentations on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an acribian organizer who was zealously based on charts - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiotes" about the breakdown of the staff computer. And he sat longer than an hour with jobs in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, it had been 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and he was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiotes, he says that the copying templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the warranty of the Director.
This readily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the landmark theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is familiar with detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thinking.
During the interview there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Reflecting in which job is clearly weighing his thoughts and struggling for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes to the day when he seems to respond unhappy to Cringelys questions and insists him to deal more quickly with topics or negotiations of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears somewhat uncleanly widespread when jobs evaluate what other companies are making right or wrong and their own vision to the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume reviews of the career jobs'. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer, which is on the jump to greatness, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"When all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalise the accounting at Apple.
Explosed how costs were recorded - mostly with "standard costs" that were quoted on mere suspicion and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope became specialist:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box", he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be swallowed into the telephone company and lead remote talks to an end.
About the device has already been written a lot, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorisation is disabled.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, acting a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while running through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grudged into the phone, it came out one minute later on the phone next," says Jobs lookernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike, which Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were able to make Henry Kissinger after.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomats, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he loved the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephones, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer that ever was manufactured".
He was as big as a bag, had a small screen with brown tubes and I loved him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
During the interview, jobs talk about the spontaneous invention of new products.
Early in his career, when he built some Platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer together.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the collaboration and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mice:
"I remember striking arguments... you cried me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Negenty days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15, which was unbelievable.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he resurrected Apple, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants rided with their visions in Stolpern and lost control over their shares.
"Do we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, well?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are forced from decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly is required by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craft art.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You took the defeat from the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fineness.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't, but electrons, glasses, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it runs out on the taste, it goes beyond the fact that you are trying to disassemble with the best thing that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clown.
We're always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh made great was that the people who work there, musicians, poetry, artists, zoologists, historians, who are randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dining with adversaries of health laws, as court adopts case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the political sharing question, whether to hear a fight against the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was sworn by the office that the case was represented before court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met a meeting to consult about the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that raised 26 states against the widespread reform of healthcare, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which was put to the mark for the conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 and a half-hour basis diskussion is expected, which is likely to encourage its result in the 2012 presidency struggle, which will be in full at the time when the judicial decision is to be announced.
The lawyer who is standing before the court and claims that the law is to climb will probably be Paul Clement, once a general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the Federal Society, an ageing group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company representing the dinner sponsorship, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who fight the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is enormously involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Head of Group of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the Federal Society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are freed from the code of conduct which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle of 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can take part in benefits events of law nearby and other organisations, whereby the judge cannot be a speaker, a honourable guest or a program no guest of such events."
Nonetheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to two of the courts related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to warn moral and government activists.
"This surprising fraction with morality and the opposite to codex punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court keeps the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnated with lawyers with sweating proceedings at the court during a beneficiary event."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to inpartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix judicial matter too easily with groups that may be guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state prosecutor under the Obama government when the first law claims came before court in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of contraception, because they were too committed to the defense of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any plants to do this.
Boeing takes a record job of 18 billion dollars to land
Emirate airline orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option of 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company receives a order of more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft total is at a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
The contractor of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flight orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars in the coming 20 years.
Boeing announced his largest job for commercial aircraft every weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer Mission came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline also, so Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai Air Traffic Audit, has an option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft, allowing the total list price to EUR 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered 6 Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improved the consumption of gas and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"It is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, the trader of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of oil-producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Instead, an increase in oil prices that usually harm the airlines, since this is one of their largest cost points, is not as harmful as the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or move flight orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in shake, which attacks the performance with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aerodrome show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be suspended, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was disappeared to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher benefit load and scope.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the President of Mexico seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported opponent Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in race around the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent government elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around governor positions in the western state by the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the whole election process and especially on the day yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have occupied electoral cabins, built road blockades ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI reigned seven decades in Mexico until they lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they pursue a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems only to have hit Claderon hardly, which had led in the investigations before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Party Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a victory.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently official governor, came to place Three, a heavy defeat for the split and luckless left leadership for the presidential election in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to start a military-directed openness against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still going on.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have gone out of fear from local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reluctant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to be represented by the PRI in the race around the president's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory will make us look courageously next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will reduce Asia's economy's growth.
Rajat Nag, Administrative Director of the ADB with seat in Manila, said that the two most rapidly growing economic nations of the world have to do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brasilien, Russia, India, China), who look "lessly" to the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everybody who can help Europe from this crisis is helpful," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the funds."
The European Monetary Union has suffered a serious debt crisis over the past months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned both from Italy and from Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is the worst that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading threshold countries would have to join together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag foretold that any aid from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU Retail Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would offer greater negotiations to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister for Trade, said that "India will do everything that is in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the decreasing exports and the drying of foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain instability and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need a high growth level."
"It's no option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an incentive to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of two dollars or less per day.
"Every time they will find out that the Greeks are going to pension with 50 and spend holidays at the beach. Then they have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with poorly guided jobs, losses inducing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The projection of the ADB with a economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/threat the "risk of graduation" now due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets should be "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defence cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warmed the congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget shortages would be unrecognized to weaken national security. Thus he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagons halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil fleet bands.
The Pentagon already considers reductions of 450 billion dollars during the next decade, but now fears that further reductions will be needed by $600 billion or more if the congress can not reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure to reach a budgetary agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% of general reductions and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such unconceived way, would make most of our ship and construction projects incomplete - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harmful," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to distinguish unwillingly from a large part of our civil staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to advocate civilians with security-limited probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our military upright and seriously harm our alert willingness."
The reductions were finally hit the battle forces," said Panetta.
"While war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the postal supervision that supports war."
"The employees' salary would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Defence Ministry.
"The consequences of a defence of the Defence Ministry would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power of the world."
"We are fighting this draconic act," the Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it is certainly nothing that you should push us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the pentagon from reductions, it remains waiting.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to gather many years of experience with the budget at the Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with serious decisions.
On a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a dark picture, which could happen - a military with shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without a sailor."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air weapon swab without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a papermaker, a army of the caserneries, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech at Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alarm willingness and is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes one angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details as to reduce "significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global utilisation and entrance, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the destruction could be victims, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing plane, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, which needs army and marine to replace the humvee.
If you stop the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to reconstruction, so that possible dangers can be burned by China and other opponents.
How to Disturb a Lüge
A view of the current pages shows how remarkable and widespread misleading and lies are in daily life.
The President-in-Office of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy to become the accusations of sexual harassment of several women.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of myid, as they claim to have retained reports after which a retired football trainer boy has sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French president Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lions destroy career and shake countries.
The New York Assembly and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself foolish when he put rejections in circulation, which were very rapidly opposed by immense evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringement in the campaign funding, which is related to the excession of a foreign business.
And then, of course, no one who experienced the media circus, triggered President Bill Clinton when he was lying in the Oval Office during his second term of office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shocking in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they were well at their performance reviews.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and shocks are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie three times each other during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person and this for both personal and professional reasons.
A long distance from a societal game, such as scarels, in which it is the goal of calling "Hab yourself!", is the deterioration of a misleading, a serious knowledge area based on scientific data collected in the course of the last six decades at respected universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of Psychology and Physiology.
A result of research is that most old myths have been disturbed about lying.
Laughs look in your eyes.
They're stumbled, stumped, robbed, and not always washing.
However, it should not be concluded that these liars are difficult to discover and discover.
A practiced liarant can go through to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine face expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and steady growth of distress. And it is clear that the deterioration of a deception is a modern ability to learn easily and help us to find ourselves in our complex world, especially if the establishment or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in appreciating other people, to wake up their interests and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are observed by others.
Thanks to research we know that the extroverted people lie more frequently than introverted people, that men of often "self-oriented" lies optical than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less frequently lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly " fat lies").
We also know that if a person was disturbed as an iniquator, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laugh, the quality of the voice of their test person.
You should better know when someone usually tricks with the foot, so that they do not accuse him incorrectly when he tribles with the foot during a meeting.
Then be careful for listings of more profound and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these gatherings as alarm bells that shrink, not as evidence of a disturbance.
People who are foolish may be starving when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet are in the direction of the door or they reject to the exit, change their position significantly or show a "sensus after the attitude," this deep, relaxing breath and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Askants often signal falsely that a postponement talk is over only to keep a look after this relaxation after the recruitment talk.
Also, watch the language of your testimony.
Scott Peterson's outbreak is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Wrong people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tough question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tough question, "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This will make the answer more perceptive than the case, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magical means to detach lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a disturbance is possible.
Thanks to these capabilities, everyone can become a victim of deceit, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the authorisation of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with the aim of being anxious and reassuring trade unions at the same time, the pipeline-built companies are trying to replan the project so that they can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be transmitted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company continues to be confident that the pipeline is finally approved, even with another course.
This was the subject of an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be taken, until the new possible course was verified that avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may take a decision by 2013 after the elections in the next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and gave its support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700.000 Barrel oil a day from Alberta Province to the raffinadery in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20 000 jobs.
But the lawyers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a return from the region of sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and watering.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy suggests that the Ministry’s main auditor requested a separate zone of the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, set by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 consultant of Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company who was ordered to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she claimed to have a kid of fear forced to break
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had got a tobacco attack that would have put her little daughter in such a fear that she gave her fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18 months old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "Personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the 10th November last year when the peanut worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the bag and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"No one appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman anxious.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to shrink - she used the F-Wort and the A-Wort and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to put water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysteric.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who still wore Genevieve on the arm, and had to be held back from her accompanying and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but was not answered.
LaBelles lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is on a non-precise compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not pay a honorary and plan the family, the money they receive, will spend the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put on a child gardener to the day that wears an 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate controversy brake the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, the unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments fell down and the economy stained.
In 2011, Sinaloas will be remembered in the economic history. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change, is the government who has great hopes about economic growth. However, as a result of the climatic disturbances, growth cannot be the speech, but, on the other hand, the main economic indicators have worsened.
In addition, the low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and led to a general decrease in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter of the year, mainly in the historical decline of agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the Frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural holdings were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partly destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the employment population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployment in Sinaloa. This is more than 18 969 persons than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirect explaining the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity losses on the market due to the medium shortcomings of the legislation adopted to combat money laundering at the congress, because for those who are prohibiting dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest or use anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is, on the one hand, due to the problems of entry and, on the other, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people are staying here and looking for work that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Blackwork
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when considering the high proportion of black work, which includes 60.38% of the employees in the country who work without paying in the social insurance cash.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages throughout Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Reference for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the general average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and growth in unemployment, the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) in 2011 is reported in the last ten years. According to Secretaria de Economía (the State Economic Authority) was the ADI from January to June 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Regierungsbehörde for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which comes from all things from the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government in July requested a credit of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested for re-activation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The national convention approved a amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of debt on any of the industries in the country were detected by November.
Reactions
The first government year of Mario López Valdé's government incapacity was apparent to the entrepreneurship representatives.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación, represented that no effort was made in 2011 to harmonise the views of different sectors, including the country government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very difficult this year. It must be hard to achieve the terrain lost this year and we have to do double efforts in 2012. The efforts of all and especially the progress of the already well agreed government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slower.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not enough to produce an economic dynamic that could produce a acceptable stream of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexiko business union) in Sinaloa, explained that the state must be made more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for the re-determining of the economic profession and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts into better pathways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has handled more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work in front of it," he said.
arrest due to 8 kg Marihuana
To five years of prison and 100 dates, a inhabitant of Navolato was condemned because of the possession of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The Republic's lawyer announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health - here the ownership of Marihuana for trade.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military on 7 June 2010 in the monitoring of Cipriano Valdez road against the watch post no. 80 in the town of El Castillato, Navolato.
The drug small dealer drove in a white delivery car, where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the bike seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the confisked product was transferred to the judge of the district and the punished person remains in the executive institution.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat programmes, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are at risk for immigrants, not being completed for lack of funds or only with great delay, meant Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The leader of the City Authority for Social Development explained that, although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now being in danger, since the government has not paid the funds which are more than 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounts to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent were falling to the state; until now only Federación and the municipality had been taxed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of construction would be expected.
"12 million have to be charged, and although the year is going to end, they haven't given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started building work, and they have already been advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, why the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its government period, which reflects the amount that the central government had had had to raise.
"It had already been so during the last period of law, because the state had not sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on, and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not used to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Management and Financial Affairs was asked to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"First 12 million have to accommodate them, and although the year is going to end, they haven't given us a penguin."
The Court approved the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals in recent years is part of the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the Chamber's House against the Bureau's Lisbon, and by which the shift of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 has to be preliminated, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for legal contempt.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties when he gave out the decree of law with details about the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes in order to allow the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, the Decree of the Constitutional Decree was proposed to explain the Constitutional Decree, as the radio and television regulations related to the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) are responsible for, therefore, the Decree would oppose the hierarchical principles and the prescription of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members raised constitutional concerns against the Decree of the Law. After the complaints were accepted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree of the law and initiated all activities for the establishment of digital transfer.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber, without joining the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that it would not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate by general rules the measures to be taken by the public administration.
"I also don't believe that if you did this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected", it also reminded that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because it is governing the state matters.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred throughout the world in recent years, and it results in a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The suspension of the turnover, she said, was a discontinuation of the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest which has not only technical aspects, "because they are insufficient to economic, social, political and security aspects."
These affairs, they stressed, "that the acting of the entire system was necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics that lay the constitution in the hands of the central government."
It called in memory that many countries had already carried out the digital turnover worldwide, over the government, although they had highly specialized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the government would comply with the law adopted by the issue of the contested legal department in the competences of the Congress," she assured.
The possibility of counting individually the voting list in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is nearly 27 per cent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 still not counted.
The possibility of a single telling of the voting list this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data published by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governing elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that the electoral body had just adopted a number of rules for harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the state in election matters last November.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or his electoral law or his right of choice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force in this election round. The governor Leonel Godoy Range avoided its publication in the state indicator within the time limits set for it, with the argument or objections against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional matter submitted by the local law and assessed the vote of the Head of State on the Constitutional Reforms as "invalid and illegal", as it does not have the right to "decision or a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individually telling the votes that thanks to the adoption of the Consejo General del IEM directives, the local election authority is now able to count the voting list partially or fully.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not match; the Protocol on the telling and calculation of votes is actually not present, or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of the fully filled electoral certificates may be made if there is a difference between the countervailing winner and the one on the second place, which is equal or less than one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party-bzw coalition chairman who is the second of those candidates.
The number of votes may also be in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, the difference between the countervailing winner and the candidate at the second place is equal or less than one per cent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the vote packages that have been suspended would be excluded in part.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is nearly 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 from a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés threw down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the dead sights and a dead mess took place.
According to family members, the last will of the chief lecturer was that his ash would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After a honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila in a plane of the Mexican Air Force to the capital of Coahuila, with the other ones killed in the accident. They took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 p.m., the ashes of the chief lecturer landed at the sad hall at Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza and where the family members and friends came.
At 17.30 a.m. his remains were studied at the Technology Institute of Saltillo. This body look was arranged by his former fellow students by the technical abitur and his American Football team, Felipe Bacio, who was belonging to the abitur during his preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ash would spread out over the Zapalinamé mountain. He had always said that his family and his friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot’s sister, announced.
From their viewpoint, the chief lecturer had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as father and son, a loving brother and he always stood in for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't understand it because they thought it would even swallow him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realise his dream, being pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he had driven to graduate his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what was best for him: flying a plane.
A last goodbye
The Leader of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the leadership of the governor Jorge Torres López. Your honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leaders and students of the Technology Education Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, and as well as in sport as excellent.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flying from him, where also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons were sitting from the same authority.
At 18.05 the inhearsed remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be transferred to members of the Mexican Air Force at the front of the Casars, as directed by Major Jaime Martinez. There he already expected his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his sisters and other families, students and teachers.

On Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse to offer.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present this to the new government that has led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse to offer.
A communication from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of State, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm government education.
It is assumed that it will present a majority of the cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm government education, but his comments show that the obstacles are overcome.
"The frame is now well stolen," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt at an incompliant level.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard spare package that has been requested by the Euro-politicians to restore the envisaged confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was still increased by the varying market situation, resulting in the taxation of Italian State bonds for 10 years by 7 per cent of interest, which corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegalia, President of the Confindustria Italian Industrial Association, informed the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government after all the powers."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The success capabilities of Montis have been significantly increased by supporting Silvio Berlusconi’s Party PDL, which had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Middle-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, for many of its members have hitherto spoken against a majority of the Government of Technocrats, which Monti forms right now.
Assistance by Parliament
Monti's new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the most likely unloved savings measures.
Resistance against his efforts or the delay of reforms could lead to a more devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises pressure with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, as well.
Monti started on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial organisations and with youth and women's organisations.
Tonight, the session round is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change in government in response to the crisis.
Following recent inhalation by the end of the last week, as known that Berlusconi would withdraw, the uncertainty of the success of the new Prime Minister has reached the costs of Italian State bonds again.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms rather than to prefer the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cab network, but the large parties are insisting that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties make the involvement of persons from political life complex.
Spanish have more games than the Ticos
From the 22 players from Spain, ten over 50 international games have on the buckel.
From Costa Rica's pages only one of the 22 calls has 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at the San José National Stadium is comparable to each other.
While the world and Europe champion, the number one on the monthly ranking of the FIFA, can look back to a considerable number of selection games of class A, the three-color team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with more than 50 international games.
This figure he reached on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influenceous clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Champions League) and high-level Europecups.
In addition, experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated excretion games at Eurocup and the football world champions.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have a few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA bar list at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (lower level 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi received even an recognition last week from the UEFA, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storms of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left sidestorm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games show in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team, Roy Miller comes to less than 30 games with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's limit.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, listed in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only one and Oelman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet their debut.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett included Costa Rica in his tour for the celebration of his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that works"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday.
Over 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream will be achieved for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This insured the Bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from a exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is located in the south-American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they appear at the National Stadium with the Band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 19.30 p.m.
You read a extract from the conversation, whose complete copy can be found in La Nación’s online edition.
For your costarican fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also works for us.
This is just the second time we play in South America and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only been a holiday in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you that because the fans of the band are totally devoted, and they are experiencing the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thanks for standing on our side all these years.
We have needed almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have used so long until we have come here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't this exercise some pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we have set in the last 21 years took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really like to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic with the jungle. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend living in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been traveling to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we've not set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile stock.
You never repeat your stock.
Why?
I think that is partly so because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play is not easy.
If we take up two or three songs that we haven't played anymore, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us, because they call us the reasons why these songs have fallen into memory. Otherwise they could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think so also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year-old story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing in a great rock band, and that has been more than 20 years. This works like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to even now be able to make music together.
We like and are excited about making music.
We're lucky to get to the places of the world we've ever wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birthday of the Grunge?
It has always been a honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band goes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We are happy to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being alive and also care for each other.
We are all close friends, why we have opened musical ways that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One knows the other and his music, and it couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with praise has not always been simple. On the other hand, thanks to your success you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We are sure not too often to be on tour, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge masses that love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of music, this reminds you that you have to respect the music and what they have called into life, without being deceived of being a famous rock star.
What reminders do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about having used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an unbelievable man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore the band selected for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this tape liked us best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer. This is certainly exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow leather bed when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I believe he sings the first thing to do with him.
Who's influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
One of the firsts that attack me is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk about the bassists that like me all afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the Grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Sound Garden, Nirvana and all others who came up at the same time, are in touch with me. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth hearing these music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work something easy. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me both when I heard how Ed played them. It's very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is arrested for 25 years of violation of human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which are four times surgered and controlled.
Alejandro Aguinaga, member of the Congress and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would examine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion was to be punished for humanitarian reasons, but he didn't want this because he considered him innocent.
He has been surgered four times in tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilograms of weight. For this, further diseases such as severe erosive gastrointestinal gastrointestinal disorders, a cyst in the stomach rice, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruese army, who was in secret acting during his government period.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
On Tuesday, an official arrangement, referred to by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts their visit from Mexico to expand trade between two countries and discussing the political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, according to the Uruguay President's statement of the highlight of his planned agenda with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collection of Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the President's office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica was looking for Calderón's support in relation to the incident with France when French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the countries still acting as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a question with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful thresholds and industrial countries. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to prevent the double layout with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the consolidation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation (OECD), which is on the basis of countries which have not introduced all international standards of tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The narrow installer joins the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has for 25 years struggled unleashed for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D country" he struggles for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month to the shops of all the world was cut to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special brilliant three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without briller," insured Omar Álvarez, responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the imagination of the video game in Madrid.
Allvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console" because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments of existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo emphasizes that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "comfortable" video game that allows a quick, liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "slight" to capture the less suited users.
Afterwards, experts can turn a "second round" over the various levels of games that become more and more difficult.
Furthermore, in real time, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twins the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last outputs: The sniffy installer must overcome with dangers of fitting platforms to liberate the Princess Peach.
However, the player is admitted to news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom carries for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take place the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo in order to be responsible in the United States for the convergence of money laundering of $70 million.
Thus, the process of the United States' request for the delivery of Portillo will end so that it can be put before court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of law and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that he did not intervene in judicial decisions during his government and put in place all the requests for delivery he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's approach is a governmental act that will take place when all courts and constitutional bodies are exhausted for the condemnation of the former Staff President (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemalas, Portillo must be delivered when its legal situation is cleared in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the destruction of 120 million Quetzales at the Defence Ministry during his government period. This negotiation was prior to the delivery, but the minister put in opposition and lived the case in a new way.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened from social exclusion
The organisation was initiated to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
At the occasion of the anniversary day yesterday, an event in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, which took part in more than 300 people, was taken into account.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinita Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the Yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions participated in cooperation with the association in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times proved the inpartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President-in-Office of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonomen Region Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the festivals of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and the current left-green Ricard Goma City Council.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the present Catalonian Ministry of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was put into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President-in-Office of the Generalites, Trinijove is an example that gives people hope to fight against difficult circumstances.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and work he does," he explained.
The occupied house where giant parties were organised was removed
The house owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street of Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house owners left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the road of Balmes.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they held illegally and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood for desperation yesterday. The roaming took place on judicial arrangement without police intervention.
After the rumor, the door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, the access will be controlled," confirmed the household manager.
The house owners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all types of waste, especially dosing with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which took up to two days and the renters were driven to despair.
Besides the building, there is a discothek, Balmes 51, who also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained Europe Press that her business had been declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discothek pointed out that the household owners made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the recreational room had been shown by the neighbors because of rest disturbance, while according to her statement of noise, not the visitors of the disco, but by the house owners, and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors' statements, became more and more and more in recent weeks.
The discothek responsible declared that the harassment had been so large that it was agreed with the owner of the building, not to pay rentals for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Stadt Police) also confirmed that in the past weeks they received more complaints from the neighbors.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked the building to be cleared in a week ago and to deal with the problems of civil cohesion and the fall of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the house owners in the last months had been occupied in all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some it even came to thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to unlawfulness and to deal with the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the district of Nou Barris was removed by the Catalonian police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the road Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, except for the disputes on the honorars.
The urban procurement on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to the new.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the ceiling of the disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its decoration on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a giant park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park was again at the top of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (bergs) and down (more).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone with wild pigs served in the role of the Yogibers, not the Central Park.
As far as the city was concerned, there was an inquiry in September, composed of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
No doubt refers a gate to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone wants to put gates on the land.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The procurement is not only from an organisational perspective, but also with regard to a reflection on the city the subject of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a reciprocal topic to which two members of this old castle, which meets in the elevator, can take account of.
And precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast, to talk about the "Front on the mountain", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"You should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," the architect judges, for which the title "Ture of Collserola" produces a "lexical trap" in itself: you must not imagine it as "as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to which they must be traded."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellektual challenge", which presents "one dangers".
Hazards due to the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swane song" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
"Restricting something means always to set the next step," i.e. exceeding it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [related to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "doube ears" although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the nearness of the mountain is to the city of the leadership letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "twistry" on whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams called in life ("that right," he says, "We architects should be only one tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the terms of the tendering conditions there is no global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-border competitions written," he says, "on the axle Mountains More. But there are no long-range perspectives that the area in its entirety are considered."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with the architect of the gate.
According to his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red liberated the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process which is led against him because of discouragement.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the second court of the district which leads the process against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for depression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas is to be seen, which mutatis mutatis mutatis mutandis to pay a sum of money, so that city management approves the secret operation of the competition house.
Following the penalty notice, the lawyer opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the panist mayor, arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest order after the minister of the Público had rejected the crimes for coupling and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prisoner because he discouraged the owners of the Casino Red with a half million pesos. However, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security area, as murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an insasse of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a prison regulation, which found that after the nearly two months of investigation, there are sufficient evidence to speak guilty of Jonas for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the contesting house to open this against.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the Mayor, to punish him, so he will be put free in the next hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he was injured and who of the owners of the contesthouse expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer rejected the name.
According to Case 119/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is freely spoken.
After hearing the representative of the contesthouse at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately put on a free foot.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he had been released and his case would be laid to the documents.
He also informed him of the legal arrangement for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details about the aircraft accident at which government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people killed.
The Secretariat de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident at which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people died, pointed out that the helicopter with its entire unforgetted structure was poured directly against the ground without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller flour had contact with trees at 25 metres in height, with the helicopter lost the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of staff.
In addition, he said that there were no helicopter parts in the field where the machine had fallen.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and therefore he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a scaling of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is important to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they may take several months, perhaps even one year.
On his side, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Assistance Services in Mexico) assured that the Helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidential had flyed on the flight speed and the plane had fallen to a soft replacement.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the explosion."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account during the investigation:
Visibility speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight, which means that the crew had had to have sufficient view during the flight and on the ground.
Whiting conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds increased.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Punching point:
The collision coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly no control loss on the plane or a deviation from the flight route has occurred before the explosion.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now indicates that the helicopter was popped up in a straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane residues presumed that the helicopter was popped up on the ground with its uninterrupted structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remnants of the plane offer no fire or explosion at the accident site.
The last results of the investigation indicate several soil contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above the sea level. The area is defective and shows a scaling of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is probably going to break.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several soil contacts.
After a minusious search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the location of the accident, no distributed aircraft parts could be found, which strengthened the assumption that the uninfilled aircraft structure had been sprouted against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the detection of the gene for fattening
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute is conducting a research project for the detection of the gene for fattening in children and youths supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexiko Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project for the detection of the gene for fat liability in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of fat liability in childhood and youth", with which the genetic marks are to be found in relation to overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for Medical Research, Key to Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, dietary specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students from postgraduated studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politeécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. stakeholders can come to the IMSS sports places in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation at the Cuauhtémoc sports site (in the west of the state México) was started and continued since 8 October at the Nezahualcóyolt sports site (in the east of the state México).
When the goal is reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study will continue at the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of fat liability and the identification of risk factors for mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the time of the global day of diabetes, he explained that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years of age should fill with the consciousness and under the supervision of their parents with food-related questionnaires.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family disease history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or renal insufficiency.
In addition, he stated that on the said Saturdays, the subjects (weight, size, number of valleys), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (examination of the identification of genes related to fattening in the child age).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the context of the concerns of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years, the proportion of fat-leaving boys increased by 77 percent and the girls with fat-leavenance increased by 47 percent. Also, overweight has increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He claimed that the search for genetic marks was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from the other peoples.
He indicated that a (e) Mexican (in) average was 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descent, which reflects in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetic of fat liability is incapable to burn out the surplus of the energy (calorias) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive examination of the children in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or fatty.
It would even examine the presence of dark skinfolding in the neck and in the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicates the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be confidential and informed by the doctors in writing. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, fat liability and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day before the television and using transport, instead of walking short ways.
The high calories intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugared beverages and hydrocarbons (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents sludges
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Mexico of UNAM developed with polymers modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs of the road coating would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 sludges if the rain period at Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Stadt area of the Tal of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemicals (FQ) at UNAM University warned and assured that if the layout and maintenance of the asphalt coating seems appropriate, the number of sludges is significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Sleakers from technical perspective", which he held on the occasion of the International Year to Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Mrera Najera said that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road coating and thus avoid the appearance of sludges.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a carbon hydrogen compound, of which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called paintings. Together, they give the road belag its characteristic telastic behavior.
The tea-lastic behavior of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of nearly 180°C it behaves like a liquid, at 120°C it is very timid and almost fixed at 50°C while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"That means that the resistability of asphalt on the roads is not equal, but changes on one day in depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer concluded.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road coating composed of six material layers, including the last three asphalts.
Between the upper layers, a layer of asphalt is lying, which consists of small, in asphalt bathed and then solided stones.
Each single stone of this layer of clothing was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moved on and powers are generated, this layer allows a good power distribution in the road coating.
"If it was modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemistry engineer.
"Over the layer of clothing," he stated, "the last layer is designed, the so-called trawl layer consisting of small stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a larger mechanical power than the closure layer and it must produce friction.
The most of the powers received and distributed by this road coating also requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular moisture and temperature fluctuations, are further, important factors to be taken into account, above all things the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the cluster layer.
When the land is moisturised, water enters into the layer and only enters hard again. This causes a vibration of all layers of the road coat and thus the appearance of sludges.
When a hithole arises, he said, "will first be deducted the deck layer, while the closure layer is only affected afterwards, but the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexiko National Research System) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the appearance of sludges. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road coating must always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent sludders.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still waiting, for example through asphalt emulsions that are even on the market in other countries, with which the sludges were easily repaired and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing by the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna to not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Again, Valle del Cauca left empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be happy to see a silver crown and the band she shows as a new Miss Columbia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento is already coming to 14 mistitles and Melina belongs to the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who almost held the crown in the hands. Among the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite girl who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not otherwise she had been elected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also had received the beauty kings Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the crown of Miss Columbia.
The first factor, which is decisive for the decision of the jury to designate it as the first miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the strongest and why?" which you had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize itself, finally I believe that the book that was the strongest for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a pretty deep book.
At the moment I read `Schuld and Honey'. It is a book of the universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that 'Leidenschaften' has.
An answer that was based on little counterlove, first because of the term 'civilize' and second because she had not explained concretely how each of her books had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people: Please read a bit `The little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that it was the preferred one who had received all the accompanying events and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience agreement on the best hand cutting costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had been jealous, which the Queen stressed, which could therefore not shine on the stage."
And it was noticed at the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two lifts at the crown celebration at her first show.
Although she was safe in both, she lacked the strength and turn that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" programme at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to Miss, "describes that the candidate who wins most prices during competition will not finally become Queen."
In addition, Valle went out to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the assembly of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they wanted a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You need to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that she had been working on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the desire and the fibrose that was noted in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that it was better to do, "but her problem with the fibrose on the stomach, which was hardly noticed honestly for me, pushed her score in the last day."
At the same time, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the errors of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay them."
Due to this prize, which is first granted by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction that was to be true in the night after the appearance of the bathing suit. It was touched that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order not to let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina enters her rule year from now on, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the national beauty competition in Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the Queens, who had lost the crown for Cartagena despite her surprising appearance, she will enter into history.
Thus the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lobhoscope from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lobhoscope of the investigation unit of the state lawyer (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armies of Colombia) was "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven lobhoscopies in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been a willing service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in criminal investigation procedures.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he should identify.
In 2000 he resided after Valle over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized himself in lobhoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand- and foot surfaces.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Elijazar was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something great expected him.
On Friday night, he fled in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla of the world could be. Therefore he should take the ten fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the study point, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bark, was dressed like a farmer of the area, had no glasses and was very thinner.
But fingerprints aren't lying.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp compared Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He saw right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to tell that it was actually the chief of the FARC.
Searching tracks
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the assessment given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a precise science without error rate, which may be a key factor in the settlement of a crime.
Lophoscopies not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals submit false certificates or they do not have any.
We take them the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that at a steal he had to screw a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had just stuck up on this place with his hand when he pulled out a sap full of juice and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspiciouss can also be discharged or charged.
Recently, a dead surrounded by scratch bottles was found.
In the investigation, a family member was suspected to be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint was agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A deactyloscopy of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a band will be used to take it.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, that's the criminal database, or to the person's office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without certificates," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said not everything was like it was represented in the TV series SCI.
As not everything is gold that shines, it is not all that you touch is a fingerprint.
Yet, it can be used when performing a corresponding comparison.
The "employment" demands the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were pushing together in tents on the Zuccotti site.
A large part came to the space command and switched its location to a nearby park.
The members of the movement of Ocupy Wall Street invited the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhattan site again, after they had been cleared from the place in the morning and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators urged themselves to access before the Zuccotti site, on which they were held together with a judicial arrangement that allowed the "emothers" the new tent in this place. However, another part of the movement remained at the space command and occupied a park north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray pointed out that the reply of the "emothers" to the decree of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came before court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent space and approved the tent.
In addition, the "Emphorts" occupied a new park located at the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least one hour, but afterwards, the police encountered and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give precise numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organisation assured that hundreds of people were found in this place, where a division of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support to the members of the movement and for intermediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti site (a private property area) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing which is still held for this Tuesday and which is intended to analyse the legality of the spaces that took place in the morning.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the place carried photo copies of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who guarded the place, which resulted in "one small collisions", as Bray reported, who indicated, some policemen had struck demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "sites adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the return of demonstrators with their tents and other things they used before."
Citizen Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that the reopening of audience and demonstrators had been lifted by this legal arrangement. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to rebuild themselves with tents and sleep bags in this place.
The Mayor personally defended the rumor of the Zuccotti place carried out in the morning, with almost 200 people arrested, and decided because the demonstrators "supported the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to put the place, because he had "converted to a place where people did not come to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to cause damage to other people," because "a few businesses had been threatened" and the people were scared "to their quality of life".
"The rumor in the morning grey was ignorant and shows that Bloomberg is in essence interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement that accused the Mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The officers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with communal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protest has already last since September 17th.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousities, she will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", Savior in "Baywatch", Rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas broadcasting of the Canadian TV.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson and the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousities will occur on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" and will bring life to a very special virgin Mary.
CTV today spread pictures of the television program, where Anderson - which also appears for the dissemination of the Internet of a self-rotated porno, where she appears together with her former husband, the actress of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a duck in the shot that Jesus is to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comet of Indian origin, who recently worked as a moderator at the sending "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen as Jesuskind.
The Christmas programme of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversial.
Bublé had recently called the North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since the last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still in the healing after the destruction of the earthquake, entering into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to 300 000 dollars, a battle that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of duration, the data on the gross domestic product from July to September were intended to finalise this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota estimated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurrection can be explained in part by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by earthquake and the following Tsunami.
Actually, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first fall after six months of unavoidable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual conversion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian disasters that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been watched, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, incurred by the growing costs for vehicles, travels and leisure jobs.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has trusted the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currencies - fled into one of the "availability currencies" of investors, who were in charge of the Eurozone debt crisis and the devastating forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that was loaded as a grave stone on the exporting companies' accounts.
With a harder currency, the products in abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony led their weak business results back to the notation of the Yen from July to September.
While markets continue to bear the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshiko Noda remains alert.
"You must take care of the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very uphearing.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the world economy showed that the brake had been drawn with the largest economic potential.
Because he fell by four tenths to lose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone is even below this average, which is 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens reappears doubts
Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement.
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also disturbing in the labyrinth that leads to the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces, is slowly proved by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Luka Papadimos, yesterday, pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundreds of days given during his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in no case, withdraw his demand for new elections at the determined date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken on the summit of 26 October," insured Papadimos yesterday to open up a parliamentary debate, which will reach its highlight tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax reduction are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The Conservative Leader took a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism, which needs to unlock the 8000 million of Athens urgently, and made it clear that he would not accept a commitment statement on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday, confirmed that it would not be to ratify its demand: economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties would not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika came back to Athens "about soon" to discuss with the new government, "which is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek knee has for a while.
Queen Sophia: "These are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "predominant" position of Spain with regard to this type of financing
Spain "had reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of smallest funding".
Queen Sophia of Spain reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has developed itself as a second donor for this means of international cooperation, which is based on the fact that it is a "intrusion for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in mankind".
The Queen gave the fifth world summit on small credits in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium targets set by the United Nations until 2015 and in particular the goal of living with income of less than one dollar on day, i.e. below the "Armuts Limit".
Spain " continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it takes this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit that takes up to Thursday will be "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the principal beneficiary of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "we face many challenges."
The summit on small credits is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen explained that it would be intentionally that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The conception of small credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the way initiated by Muhammad Yunus "for years ago", which the Queen Sofia assesses as a "Action of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described her as a "admirable idealist who wrote to the fight against poverty" and whose work she knew for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on site.
This experience followed one year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of us "we have been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "family head" in Valladolid and as "the front-president of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind development aid to times of economic trees because it was a "continuous obligation".
Jiménez felt that the small credits were "a serious and rigorous politics for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained "the success", "marginalized" people, "which are always standing before closed doors" "hopping" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city that opens "their gates, inclined by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU President due to general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, gave Angela Merkel, Kanzler and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the programme, but has been undertaken in the autumn, particularly in order to provide the activists who are admitted to the government policy on the Greeks today and possibly in Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only voted nine against, ten had the vote.
The several minutes of persistent standing Ovation, which, due to their interventions, first applied to Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schueble, did not open any doubts from the three European Ministers of Finance.
The main idea of the office is to bear, as well as the requests, the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace but also that "new millions of jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
"The time for a breakthrough in Europe has come for the cansler."
This could be expressed by a strengthening European Union control of the Lisbon Treaty as regards the budgetary policy of the countries in the Eurozone, but this could also be the case in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting to give Europe a face.
However, this is, in any case, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly made Wolfgang Schuble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 votes quickly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegations in an overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which obviously implies the first emphasis on Germany's position.
Consequently, the canciliator, who is concerned with the rest of the climate within her party, has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the cost of the "small" or the European countries in trouble that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds me that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact one of the most humiliating defeat of the Napoleon army.
What represents fraud in illness reports?
Following family aid, UMP and government are now attacking the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family support fund and to present a talk about the issue of fighting against social fraud and economic dependency from the state, which has been repeated since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the efforts made to undertake the economy in a hard trial, but on the other hand, the prebode of an axis of the right presidency campaign is not less concentrating the majority on employee disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government shows the introduction of a fourth carriage day before taking into account a medical notification of workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper"Les Echos" threatens to condemn anger, but would help bring 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic character of a different measure was: to grant the officials an unpaid carence day in the case of disease (to date, in contrast to the three carence days in the private sector, there is no period of cardiac).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also reproduces fraud topics, targeting this time the abuse associated with work abuse.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will be reimbursed when this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November, before the microphone of the Sender RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the fields of illness reports seem a little unproportionate.
In fact, this is the subject of permanent monitoring and political openness, which has been most frequently borne.
The French are not more frequently sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, however, let us make the national figures.
According to the National Hospital Bank CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
The Community of the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health represented the day-to-day findings in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
This amount was 46% in relation to maternity leave and accidents and 54% in relation to disease leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group in 2009, the French were only 14,5 sick days in average compared to the 17,8 days in 2009.
A medium value that distorts certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed, French employees reported not to have taken a single day of illness.
Another study that was recorded this time by the health insurance shows that 37% of the illness reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, the French workers tend to be unable to work no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French, State Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (sickness or other reasoned) increased between 10% and 11% in France compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in illness reports represents a disappearing small proportion of black work.
As regards the claim, there is only a weak outmatch here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systmatic controls in illicit messages exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public University of Technology and Engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term, short-term sickness messages, which are called 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematically controlled cases of illness reporting of more than 45 days, among the 1 2 million were 11% of "unjustified or unjustified" cases called 132.000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a disease.
A figure representing only a weak exam to those of black work, for example.
According to the UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of a report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus considerably more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to reduce its economy.
This had announced on Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, in addition to the fact that the government of the Union did not grant a hundred days enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to promote the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budget adaptation programme," the Head of Government in his first public speech explained in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence voice on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of the country within the Eurozone was at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the state deficit of the country"in order to reduce the 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new sparma take-ups
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wings, had given his consent on Monday with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be ready to obtain an additional sparma take-up.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at the time of a parliamentary meeting of his Party of New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready with the requirements for reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as for the fight against waste, but every policy that would undermine the economic growth was opposed to an enemy.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks responsible for EU Commissioner, who had prevented the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion from being released without written warranty of all parties about their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had answered that his word would be sufficient and would not sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasie and accompanying free death must be legalised, such as an expert agency
The Canadians live in denial of death, as shown in a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The body explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to pain-linering treatment in order to provide the best pain-lining agents, and this also beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way in order to allow accompanyed suicide and euthanasia to make the choice, in patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As an entrance, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, comparing the quality of death in 40 countries of the earth's ball.
Although Canada has placed on this 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut off the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painstilling means, so the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, however, at last 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
The rate of death in Quebec has been the highest by 86% from the whole country to the hospital.
In the very question of Euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the rapporteurs of the report find conclusions that are against the position of the federal government, which has already been dissuased to make no changes to the law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all the countries whose approach to euthanasia and accompanyed suicide has legalised or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such a decriminalisation would lead to miscriminalisation in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of incompetent or unauthorised persons.
On the other hand, much more cases of such infringements were faced just in the countries where Euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signor of the report yesterday, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthania is practiced in Canada, where she is clearly illegal."
"Oftly accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian advocates the Euthanasia
Unfortunately, according to angus-Reid Survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already been exposed to the benefit of Euthanasie, since they believe that they allowed people to facilitate their suffering at the end of their way of life.
And 66% believes that the legalisation of Euthanasie does not lead to the message that the life of older or handicapped people has less value.
As regards those who have already exercised a accompanied suicide, the respondents believe 41% that they should not be persecuted criminally.
The situation is less clear in terms of maintaining or setting up the funds in patients, such as the authors of the report.
They also point out in their recommendation list that the criminal law should indicate that the suspension of the funds for which a legal refusal was made should not be considered criminal.
In addition, the expert body calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the discontinuation of the funds at the end of life, and must fear this without criminal persecution.
The body explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to pain-linering treatment in order to provide the best pain-lining agents, and this also beyond cancer cases.
Finally, as regards the medicines already used in the Canadian Healthcare Institutions, the body calls for pain-release or life-releasing measures to consider them at least, as these were little to reduce physical pain and refer to the same procedures as the euthanation.
Constraints of other experts
Some experts in the legal field of health have already provided reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extrem" among other things, since they do not set any limits in the final phase of the euthanation practice in sickness.
"This opens the paves for a situation in which everyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age is asking another person to be helpful for his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social community.
But now, he says, there are "lines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly doubtful about the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad for power absent
Damaskus pranges a "Complot" on
Syria is insulated.
The Partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Baschar al-Assads, which, however, resists this, thanks to Russia's support and a "complot" which is directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion through the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan yesterday was the official Arab Prime Minister, who had invited President Baschar al-Assad to put his power down in Syria, in which the 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Looking Bashar the interest of his country on the heart, he would dismiss, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that since the beginning of the year the Syrian regime, Turkish intermediary attempts had not been crucified by success.
"The ones in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he explained in speech on Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steady rage.
The United States, on its own, welcomed the "surgeration of the consensus against Assad and the creations of the Syrian regime" due to the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, Arab Leagues and countries like Turkey have an increasingly sharper tone in Syria in view of the repressions," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria have died, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in the beleagued city of Hom in "shots exchanges and heavy bombs of jobs".
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Auβenhandelsminister Walid al-Muallim was still of the opinion that the country's taxes on the end of the crisis'.
On the other hand, he reacted with the emphasis on the conclusion of the Arab League to suspend Damaskus from his tasks, which represents his assessment after a "hazardous step".
Syria "will not be imputed," he added, under the deception, "the complots that were smote against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently exploring a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of the dispatch of UN observers in order to protect civilians from the regime's repressions that he was encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
A new reconciliation of the Liga is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November for crisis-auction, but in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of military troops from the belagered cities and the release of captured demonstrations.
The Russian Auβenminister Sergej Lawrow classed the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" yesterday to guard against the punishment of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian Head of Government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and to implement a programme that demands "offers" to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his duty to call a cabinet into Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of a number of smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the official President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had, on his part, waited for Mario Monti to give Parliament a voting voting of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be given in the presentation presented by M. Monti to a list of strikes, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen of ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the stressful nervosity of the markets in stock exchanges and obligations demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it is "safe that markets will show themselves sound and discreet."
His order by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the disturbance had been reinforced again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decrease in the euro area in September.
The official Prime Minister was supposed to establish a staff consisting mainly of Technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he appreciated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence certificate until Friday.
M. Monti has been obliged to work in all urgent terms in the sense of the objective to make Italy "renew protagonists" in Europe.
A speaker of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "which does not change our diagnosis to the Italian economy even taking into account the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget compensation in 2013 despite the saving plans taken in these last months, has in particular applied for new harsh measures.
Emma Marcegalia, "Chefin of the Chiefs" of Italy, which will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also depends on the need for economic incentive", because a country that does not have to demonstrate any growth cannot respect the deficit marking."
M. Monti, known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "epochen change" in Italy after 17 years"Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "examination of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", the leadership article authors.
The largest unknown of this was the long-term life of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy has now arrived for EUR 200 billion government bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranic nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a core weapon-usable sprout capsule, so confirmed on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents based on this UN Agency for the detection of this scientist.
The AIEA had notified last week its "awesome concern" in the context of a "possibly military dimension" of the Iranic nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, the 1934-born Danilenko had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s for over three decades and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he should have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev which produces "Nano-Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in a Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong indications that the iranic development" of a nuclear fuel system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only too emigrated in this technology but also, as a member of the Agency announced, his entire professional career beyond this technology has worked directly at the military nuclear energy programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and debts have increased by 50%
The crimes and offenders targeted against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either decreased slightly or slightly in the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed to Muslims was increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease against Jews, as well as a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hassed crimes" has increased to 6.628 cases in very weak maße, including 47.3% by race differences and 20% by religious differences of criminal offences, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights First emphasised.The increase in anti-Islam violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes should be considered as a serious legal distinguishing against human rights," Paul Legendre, an organisational manager, added.
"The American Government can and should do more to combat these crimes," he added to the estimate that this could be done with a better political attitude toward the "hash crime".
The "hash crime" is inherited in the American Federal Law as a heritage of the battle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violence against race, skin color, religion or destination, and now also involves sexual association crimes.
Twitter walks the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in order to allow their users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enables better readable live follow-up of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users, whose news ("Tweets") you are pursuing and following your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they are allowed to follow their messages, subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August at a low percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner stated before the French Press Agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, decorated with something esotherically encouraging words (RT for referencing the repetition of the contribution of another person). follow Friday pour recommander de suivre unaure utiliateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users debated on the network using certain "Tweets" via this innovation.
"This is unnecessary, urgent and similar to very Facebook," says @jemb123.
"The function "activity" will help me to pursue certain elements of my flux twitters better", reliable @dannykron stream.
Austria
Inclusion of a 'Golden budget rules' in the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Socialist/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to include a "Golden Budget Code" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation from rating agencies at the top of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Secretary, Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council, although the public Austrian debt is 74.6%, which is far beyond the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capabilities weren't reduced to a battle of AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euro interests in addition every year," said Michael Spendelegger, Vice-Cansler and Christian Democratic Auβen Minister.
Austria also claims the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have required the inclusion of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public account balance into the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the 'German model', as Germany had been the first European country that had included such a 'regulation' into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the structural deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while the regional states should have balanced households as well as the municipalities.
The aim is to eliminate budget debts under the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Agreement in the Horizon 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese force would intervene again on monetary markets if the Yen should continue to increase.
"If we'll find an excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, we'll intervene as we've done last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday the Yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese devisive value, which has been in charge of a new record value compared to the dollar since 1945.
Yen, however, has grown regularly over it by buying investors, which regard the Yen as "availability value" in these uncertain times of world economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 Yen on Tuesday, the euro was shot under the symbolic late of 105 Yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar noted around 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This strohfire of the Japanese devisor harms the exports of the Archipel, as it deprives the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value of Japanese companies from abroad, as they turn them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the Tsunami, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (Nordosten), for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who fears that this deepness of Yen could kill the weak rise already in the chemistry.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter, has gained 1.5% from the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the staggering export increases and the consumption of the "plumbated" households in the catastrophe.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the dignity of the Yen does not reflect "the Japanese economic foundation".
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all thoughtful measures to eliminate the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, vice-president of the Institute, has noted that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", which makes it acceptable that on Wednesday no additional monetary locking could be expected.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) that it had used for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet fast to the height, exchanges make retractors
The risk of infringement of the debt crisis continues to undermine European numbers.
Despite the office of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The exchanges still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone also operate this Tuesday, on 15 November, a little more in negative cases.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 a.m. at 1.4% and fell to 3.064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London was 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions relating to the return on government bonds in the Eurozone in difficulties, the global share markets continue to deliver some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional Broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Press Agency Reuters.
The stock exchanges in Tokyo, which, on their part, suffer from the new fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis persists, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused his eyes on Europe, and trade moves to a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," appreciates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurrection of concern about the future of the Eurozone damages the unit currency that continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it left by 0.4%.
According to the carriage makers, the CDU, the party of the Kanzler Angela Merkel, who had gathered on Monday at the Congress, has made an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries that are in trouble, to get out of the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The loan rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, the Spanish title grew up to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had, on his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was the main task of its government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, since Parliament's elections are held in the country on Sunday.
However, the interest-sharing ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-olds has once reached a new historical high.
In the expectation of Eurozone growth figures
In the third quarter, France accounted for a economic growth of 0.4% in the household consumption, which was a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE statistical Federal Office had revised the baisses of the numbers of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that concerns the economic experts most.
Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first settlement of the whole Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., warning the Commission against the risk of re-recession.
Energy policy:
Features should be seized about dogs
If there is a subject that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly influence the purchase force and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a vote for the purpose of thinking about this topic and about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it distorts the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their views on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution drives a double of electricity demand until 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to avoid a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to facilitate the deterioration of fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without the compulsory need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in his decision to avoid nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitutionable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, who just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
However, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to mention only a few countries, their projects continue to pursue with decisiveness.
The United States, on its own, decided to join their park by re-operating the work of Three Mile Island after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is designed for renewable energy sources, is sometimes an example, then the reality contradicts the discourse.
The elimination in Berlin will result in a degradation of the electricity price, an energetic dependency increased by the increased withdrawal of import gas in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power stations.
The total of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader of wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; accordingly, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistentness of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity calculation in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy is a key role in competitiveness and a competitiveness of the industry on national ground, French companies have a benefit due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the noble statements on reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of buying power to illusion.
Inquiries showed that this is a price that the large majority of the French are willing to pay as little as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Contrary to the fact that our country's energy policy has enabled an industrial sector of 125.00 direct and 410.000 induced jobs to build.
Due to its strong export characteristic, she brings a variety of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them to creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to excurse from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victims of it and the annual 6 billion euros would be more and more merged in investment goods and nuclear energy exports.
What electrician would a EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the decline of its producer was programmed before?
In order to solve the energy equation, you must admit that there is just as little a miracle to the production of electricity as a devil.
The solutions developed by the company Areva, CO2 arms for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy prove the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that conducts compromiseless and transparent controls in existing works, such as building in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have been named due to their professionality, are just to be possessed by the safety performance.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so he did without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was raised by reactor design and infinite human failure.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused in the past, which caused the death of several tens of thousand people.
The core industry will draw their teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previous.
As the fruit of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fantastic gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free trains to travel the lead position in the unavoidable nuclear power development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that determines our country's economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration load or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized by many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself stated.
Recently, the disaster against foreign students had deepened the week views, the Minister of Interior had announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "no talent, maurer or cellar from abroad" needed.
But this policy was rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
Indeed, there is a widespread consensus between the right and the left.
On the right hand, the tone was attacked by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 had explained that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who presented 1990, couldn't take up the whole poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of greedyness.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish Klempner was divided from both right and left in 2005.
From both camps, the immigrants were considered as burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greedyness that is to be admitted to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is restricted in his programme to banalities that point out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically expensive.
Like us, the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron compare the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of immigrant fluids on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Increasing immigration would eliminate growth and harm the situation on the labour market.
The fears against the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
Experience, however, shows that the immigrants in truth are far more complementary than the local wage workers, since they exercise heavy-point professionals in sectors which are unexploited in jobs.
The low-qualified immigrants are working in sectors where local employees are little travelling, more qualified among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Similarly, as a surgeon would have difficulties in working in a country in which a lack of anaesthesists is concerned, this complementarity also produces a positive effect of immigrant access to wages and national labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration flow leads to an inclusive long-term increase in realloons between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the idea creation and economic growth introduced by the immigrants is tolerable (major share of emigrated immigrants among American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The immigrants also contribute net to social systems, in the average European countries, about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Working Organization estimates that a person immigrant to Germany at the age of 30 will generate a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of about 150,000 euros over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to accommodate the missing cutting points "with the teeth".
However, these teeth, which should shock the immigrants, achieved exactly the counterpart effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to recall himself who, after its invention in Athens, had over two thousand years ago passed the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the first world war, totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the chief in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was rich in exercising the right to vote, in the best possible way to see democracy overcome their enemies once and for all.
You know since Napoleon, "the little one," that it was a characteristic of mind-keeping.
The general right of choice, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this, and can become the "suppression instrument" as it then expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, training, economic and social spirit, a judicial speech.
The crisis in Europe in which we are located is an economic crisis, but it is as much as it is, first and foremost, the political and democratic crisis.
The change in mind of the Greek True-Falsk referendum would have been duplicate in this respect: once the need for a powerful return to politics, on the other hand, but also those of the alarming feelings of their inability, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A free sign for the European single ruler or a jumping with connected eyes into the emptyness of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, cleared and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisiss in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you are no longer aware of where to stop the listing - because there is only one crisis, which is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that bows to the dictate of markets and rating agencies suffering from its imperfection and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
You are concerned about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is the whole Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every individual of the nations in which it belongs.
The urgency is to give the people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is at the overall level whether the Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, release themselves from the markets and drive a future through investment.
The emergence from the crisis has decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic justice without surely bringing us to ruin.
After this proposal has been combated by Jacques Delors and the socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic management to do so.
I agree.
But this would be a new foolishness and another sackgasse without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it sweats to the citizens.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic arise in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards will be for the general benefit
The world fair for chip cards opens their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
The year 2011, according to Eurosmart, should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most wearing segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation of purchases by simply keeping the map on a reader.
Over the 320 million sold one year before this year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip map market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the non-contact payment to soil after long time behind the Asia-Pazificant region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400 000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to increase speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions are obliged to provide their customers systematically in the future banking cards that are covered with contactless chips," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Test banks Payment by phone
However, this is only one first step on the way to the payment fund of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices is now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out these transactions.
"You've been ratted in departure."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are intended to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that allows their customers to pay free of contact by phone.
Terrorist front understands from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationships between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Section Boko Haram.
The long-experienced relations between the al-Qaida Terrorist Group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβen Minister Abdelram Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained certainty about it.
"The way both organisations act and the relations of the secret services point out to a clear cooperation," he said without continuing to go into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the departure of two French in the Niger held last January have promoted interfaces to days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, which were captured in a restaurant in Niamey by adherers of the Aqmi, should have been killed on the following days at the same time as several of their kidnappers at the time of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips in the chains at the place of use, which were the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to a Nigerian, who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which has stopped the weighing of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the section.
"This is a progress, but no doubt you must wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is, however, possible."
"You have been aware for years that the secve involves financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo humiliates.
In these last months, these "support services" have become more and more violent in their course, as well as the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide assassinators and the use of more complex explosives, which carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to begin with Washington, has since that time exercised pressure on Abuja in order to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact considered the grouping over a long time as a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in the surroundings of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "the western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northernmosphere of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger experiences rapid success.
It is politics and demands strict compliance with Scharia, while the activists joined her in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the shower.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
The reaction of Abuja is, however, as usually indicated.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the seed becomes more radical and leaves its high-burgers in the north.
Last Christmas she knew about an attack in Jos, which demanded 80 human life, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned to the blame of a suicide assassination that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his type.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is a priority international target disk.
The formation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has since then disturbed all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, in a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and was willing to "notify all the indications."
The world of the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and insight regarding China, Iraq and the helping position for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America have a complex world of simple, not saying, single ideas lead?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their contributors have repeatedly made their thundering statements and their statements on Auβenpolitik, traditional republikan focus.
Through China, Iran and the Israeli help - often undermined in no way - slogans.
With regard to the designation of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest in the course of Romney, the Chinese threatened to quote before the WTO and to address it to the "earth manipulation" leading topic in an America that is the most angry by the migration of all industries to Asia.
He said that if this is to impose the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate, who seems to have a mature vision of Auβenpolitik, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions of smiling hosts.
He had called for a handy but constructive exchange of conversations with Peking (also the current attitude of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not answered, as he is staggering into the depths of the question of opinion.
Reagan's Eleven Image
Romney had also praised military battle against Iran if the penalties were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I order the Iran Consumer," he had tanned.
"When Obama is reselected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel greater military assistance and accused Obama to remain guilty of this partner to commitments.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second most placed candidate, has a shameful file insights.
He recently called on to give the Chinese military threat contra, since Peking's attempts to develop a nuclear power' - and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military struggle against Iran, is too willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The reaction to Folterma arrests by Obama 2009 against mutae terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
You are far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an audience policy gravity.
The current Presidential Contractors, Reagan has also had simple ideas and despite all, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama is also an amateur and had to give water into his wine, as was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly persist on the failure of his naive speech with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "Jung" from Iraq, his uncertainty in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of the weakness.
However, this enemy is not quite so obsessed.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she guards against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to raise his leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, which runs on the sea ground of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to deal with this event with glans and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have attended the last Tuesday on the East Sea Coast under orchestra ring and at the Feinschmuck buffet the dedication of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which Russia and Germany are directly connected to the sea level.
The German Kanzler Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his official colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, symbolically turned the tax of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the western European network.
The new gas pipeline aims to deliver 27,5 billion cubic meters additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, which connects the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to Western Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you are already leaving the eventuality of the construction of a third line on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and pointful completion of this huge construction works like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream pipeline will allow for direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any tracing by third countries (Polen or Ukraine).
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will become more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening the accession to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not reversed to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the Association between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is too sensitive in political terms.
West Europe has gained even more security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of decovering European energy, since the project has hit a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and their gas occurrences.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new species that connects us organically," confirmed François Phillon in the dedication of the gas pipeline, pointing out in what degree the large gas contracts are also important from political and economic side.
All of this explains the wide smile of the numerous Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin as regards the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The subwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete amplification to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m depth.
During her construction, mine fields that dated from the Second World War had to be removed.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, speaker of the North Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect Fauna and Flora.
The line is a long hose of metal, difficult like 242 egg towers that have been interrupted throughout the length of nothing: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible have taken away from it, since Sweden had little insistance on seeing a Russian state society permanently at its coastal level.
"In the case of a havary, we close the gas flow in less than one minute," Jens Müller explained.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is evacuated into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors as very little likely, as the sweeps were estimated to be persistent by a leak per 100.000 years.
The governmental monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot which is controlled for external observation purposes by a sea ship, as well as by a device circulated inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigarette, with a metre diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved by gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the direction at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device provides the most detailed information on any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without also to be subject to the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their powers in order to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are listed (e.g. 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of GDF Suez (e.g. 9%).
These five companies have established a company community named Nord Stream and which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has its seat in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then hired the entire capacity of its gas transport, which is for a prolongable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of how large the actual transporter is going to fall out of gas," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline takes place on a sandy, wooded coastal line with kips at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4,5 metres high valves form the gaseous exit sprays.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
A Italian company had been able to live about fifteen years ago, Moleskine wanted to re-administer the writing.
It has a flair of adventure to be spent hours with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular entrance, its rubber band, the egg shell-colour pages, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as you know it today, has been created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to market a separate design notebook at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert adviser of the company, is responsible for the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which is called a cottonlack, used for for example for polster benches.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten object that was considered the icons of avantgardist artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now trademark responsible at Modo Modo.
The success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increase by 26% and set up with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine happens to the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a fantom picture of the buyers, since the notebook is enthusiastic with business people as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, has now employed more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in book deals, on web portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands its identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and its new writing needs, which exists despite the e-mail swinging," Mary Sebregondi explained.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exposure named "Detour (omweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, at the time of the film festival in Locarno, the company also brought a link with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood the diversification of its products: bags, appointment calendar, filler, computer holes... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings denyer to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate remaining at such a high level?
About 19% of the handicapped persons are looking for a job.
Today, the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is always twice as high as the average average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so emphasises Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which is directing the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times so high."
"Nothing controversy remains huge enough to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployment, there are still many obstacles before they get a job.
The elderly ages are more frequently: 37% are over 50 years (17% average).
They have a low grade of qualification: 80% of them have no abitur and there are only 100,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education graduate.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% in the disabled population compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that are difficult to get back to work, and which are the "cores of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based association that helps companies to recruit disabled persons.
That's so much for the pleasant brakes.
Keeps the unprecedented, the mental attitudes, which, although sure, develop, but slowly.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers asked have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by persons in rolling chairs, psychological or intellectually minor".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees have a wide range of ways to achieve the job target of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These last named figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now at the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for entering contributions from companies who disregard this law.
The proof: the number "payers paying" businesses have decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also shows real knowledge in particular in the large companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the firms between 20 and 49 employees are disabled, but companies with 100 to 199 employees are 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Service Providers (20:45 a.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would have been too far to claim that there was a secret consensus between them, but the image speaks symbolic bonds.
On the side of the viewer podium of the city de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to close peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had no more than praise about his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the gentle liller on his side.
As regards the contrast between its representation in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Little the whole year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, come on Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France to finally "glance".
However, without leaving the note of "delight".
The French national team runs him since the age of 7 years, leading his victorious fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will necessarily contribute to strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he convinced.
"We just walked over the way."
"To be able to play them means great happiness!"
Leeken's reads with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride to carry out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his quality as "now children" - that France" has become a team at a very high level," and that is little more than a year after the dream of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done fucking good work," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the engineer is very likely to see the plane share with the blue (the French National Elf) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians come out largely," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice that in the forthcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very convinced
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to the replay against Bosnia (22:00 a.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
During matching, two teams had missed the accomplishment.
"On the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his National Elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will be qualified for the European Championship in 2012.
For Portugal, this in fact means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiel (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party over more than one hour, but the team was not able to push the matter out the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which presents a certain risk, since we have not reached a gateway."
However, at home, in their brightly radiating towns de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike before a audience, which would be like hot on the game, even if the party was naturally announced as "very little," said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very slight match, but are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to join the European Championship in 2012," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz was relative.
The disagreement on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
A disagreement can already satisfy the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, that presents a certain risk, because we have not reached an outdoor gate," Bento regrets.
"We are going to join a team that has high technical quality and has players with many individual qualitys," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would be in favour of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "not give you time to think."
A good idea, under the condition that it is put into reality this time.
