Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to amend the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is tormented.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘greams on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poep.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is 'inconsistent' and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, who is currently working on the drafting of legislation to carry out the change of name, said: ‘It are of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Meeting of Wales received the right to change the name of the Meeting.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be re-baptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in public consultation.
At the moment, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a difficult time to reach a consensus.
The legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when debating legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the amendment of the name of their country
Sunday votes electors whether they want to change the name of their country in ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to solve a striking dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athene claims long that the name of his northern neighborhood means that the country would claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the national consultation on the change of name, said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is just the price to be paid to be a member of the EU and the NATO.
The Clocks of Saint Martin's silence, the Harlem's are having trouble
"The older people with which I spoke said that here was a café and a church at each corner before," said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to detect."
He said it's understandable that cafés have gone.
"Men now have another social contact," he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly walk.”
However, he is concerned that the earnings of the sales of the assets of the churches will take less long if the leaders expect, ‘and they are asked or left back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
“The large majority of the people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to the close of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments become members of the church community.”
Both churches have ever been built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropool: the metropool community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists has disappeared in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the direction of Erwert John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shopmakers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be proclaimed.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parochians of Eerwert Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a cherry.
Eerworthy David Johnson, the son of Eerwert Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the arrogant pride “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the cherry in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an inexchangeable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first noble of the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger narrow of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some hired by the church lecture leaders, others by the bisdom.
The constituency (the governing body of the parochy, composed of lecture leaders) wrote the bisdom in July to express its concern that the bisdom would ‘will calculate the costs’ to the constituent, although the constituent had not been involved in hiring the architects and occupants who had sent the bisdom.
Some parochians complained about the lack of transparency of the bisdom.
Hai hurts 13-year-old crying in Californien
On Saturday, on the first day of the crown season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who came to crowns in California. The boy went up injuries, so it sounds.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been handed with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy shout for help. Together with some others, he pedled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy cried because he had caught a reef, but then he realized ‘ that the boy cried, ‘ I was prayed!
I'm prayed!
His key legs were completely open,' saw Hammel when he approached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone should go out of the water, "There is a hai in the water!".
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in danger of life.
It's not conscience which kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, captain Larry Giles told that a few weeks earlier had been spotted in the vicinity, but that then it was concluded that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously wounded to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours in view of research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 haaien species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's focuses on competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large warehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to acquire the British beauty market, worth £ 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they are introduced into more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the ranges of TVs, magnetrons and interior articles with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3000 products, including for the first time marking Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be more place, with tables per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up on the market again, now most products are suitable for veganists, something that younger shoppers demand more and more.
In addition, parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was previously opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Since more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to shopping with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that shops will look more and more like large warehouses, now the supermarket chain takes it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have made more profit.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Apothec a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict about the distribution of income from the pharmaceutical department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's is 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for a amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding an extended gamma of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department so this is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer for everyone a lot of will, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'worn' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'worn' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced in Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones from Dragons Den is racing on Holly Willoughby, because she has in the last time withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘worn’ when Willoughby at a difficult meeting in the main settlement of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that by her new contracts (with a value of almost half million pounds) she does not have sufficient time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is once compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of estimated 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby at Instagram announced that she would leave Truly, Jones left to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would guarantee her long-term future and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The carpet of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars of Great Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the great investment in products from kisses and candles to clothes and homewear, and because the launch could now lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-year friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40 percent in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will soon be trademark ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British Sender ITV.
A source from the entourage of Jones said yesterday night, "We have no comment on his business matters."
Hard language “and then the love between us”
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment that he made that some people would find "inappropriate for a president" and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the High Diploma Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a 'conform response' by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its penalties to keep the pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the electoral.
"We're doing very good in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The rocket tests have been completed, yesting are liberated and the material surpluses of American military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 100,000 people who try to access this busy arena would stand about 200 people here," said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ruin an island with hundreds of deaths
In the afterlift of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had no more dwelling, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
"In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international assistance, which is difficult for us," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the helpers from abroad can work at the place.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disasters Assistance Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still working to evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts they are rare.
That there was no warning cirene for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to the other.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok in order to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the site of the disaster.
The improvement of the harvestless infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the key points of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be reselected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by persistent sektarian stresses in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their dwelling because Christian and Islamic bands were fighting on the street, with makeets, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalisers against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge kept Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood on a distance of about 30 metres from the goal of Chelsea, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tied left to the ball and then shot towards the farst palace.
The ball fled high above the punishment area, towards the right upper corner of the net.
He disappears the spring of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante approach and dare a try. I didn't really think about it, I just shot on the ball.”
Chelsea was at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The spits of The Blues shot the ball with his hill to Mateo Kovacic, and then he speeded through the middle field to the playhelft of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a fast one-tweet in the middle field.
Then he gave a beautiful steppass, allowing Hazard to reach the punishment area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left foot beyond Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back palace.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the Champions League's group phase against Napoli, in the Stadium San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea takes the Thursday at 15 a.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The death of tsunami in Indonesia is up to 832
The number of deaths of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, said the Agency for assistance in national disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that had been collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 of the last Friday, which also produced waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380.000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's stand-up to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The ban on the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic purites.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'a attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to showing the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful picture of Cromwell, made by Sir William Thorneycroft, testifies the opinion that was dominated in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defendant of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a perfectly correct representation, it is still debated.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that clown.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and recognised."
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, only known as the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a stal on the market in Liupanshui in the Province of Guizhou. His artery was surrounded and he sat under blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig steel, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and showed a door to a neighbouring pig stable open.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood was found on his mouth in the pig shock.
A forensic investigation showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and blended,” said the cousin with the surname “Wu”, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On pictures of surveillance cameras, Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 hours to carry his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market operator told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent others from attacking, while the police collected evidence in places.
The family of Yuan and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens only rarely, but there have already been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, which made the man seriously hurt.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife left the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News witnessed that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can evacuate aggression.
“They're just plays.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not out of the way to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The star of the orkaan Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, orkan Rosa weakens now she has reached the cooler waters of the North Coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a local orchestra of category 1 on Sunday morning at 5 hours and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's going to rise to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a troop begins to form above the Pacific, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California skirt on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northwards, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Afterwards, tropical moisture that responds to the approaching tragedy will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, ruin flows and possible earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to downfall from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deterioration, because the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into desolate rivers, and the weather will produce local windflakes and dust.
The approaching troop locally brings some heavy rain to parts of the southern Californien coastal line.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small ruins and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rain season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening to Monday night, and the rain on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday will be more spread.
Heavy rainfall will spread on the Four Corners Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can vary strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., it is expected that October starts warm, with temperatures everywhere swimming around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can become 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances to mid-October are high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people looked at one of the six television networks on Thursday to the fascinating witness of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was expected to take place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasts interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: a agreement agreed by Jeff Flake, senator of Arizona, to examine the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senates Committee on Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh hurted her and tried to extract her clothes at a high school festival.
Kavanaugh declared in a zealous witness that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have looked at Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no figures immediately available for the other networks which sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in a office.
Similarly, that's about as for a play-off of a football bet or for the Oscaruitreiking.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the hearing day: average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican declared that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with a beaten eyes while he was embarrassed, live on CNN.
"I'm right here," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and just before the lift, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters sinned everything lively when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of that sense that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the medinated against the next week, something that the minority Democrats call on.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused criticism of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May politicians criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests.
President of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Great Britain and the EU had to enter each other's taxes was 'absurd'.
Shooter Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison on suspicion of death, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the place violent and found the DNA of Simpson on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interviewed Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The body viewer of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a provisional report on Friday which states that the death cause is a shot in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the Criminal Lab of the State Police, the Southern University Police and the local inhabitants all have contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “inzet and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He reached the last season average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team "capot" and "in shock" was dead by Waydes.
"This is an event that you always hope it will never happen," says Wade.
Volcano spoils as in Mexico City
The ash sprayed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered in a 24-hour period.
The centre detected several times rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin low ash appeared on automobiles in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake with a power of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico hit.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the spring of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence activists succeeded with the opera police, while thousands of participations in rival demonstrations at the occasion of the first birthday of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which distinguished the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the oproer police cooled the agents with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds to occur in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screen excursions broke out with the police, and the agents picked up their knee to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don't forget, not forgive’, while their opponents called ‘Long Life Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries that they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but are celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed themselves overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against divorce were the voting boycotten.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the voting offices of the region, which led to violent screening.
Pro-independence groups had struggled on the place the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“Previous year we have experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties gained an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was negotiated, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success, because many of their most famous leaders are disappeared, either in self-inhabited exile or in prison, waiting for a court case on their role in organising the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monteur who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the preliminary arrest since the end of last year, stated that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate hour for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.

Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to the same height with Hibernian.
Gerrard's plague did not succeed in this season in winning a fight during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston remains unhappy in the meantime. The team has now won six matches in his department, and trainer Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to realise a advance long before the first point, because their direct way of playing took care of various problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing with a target. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, shot the ball above the goal.
The homeployer let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances quietly and self-assured.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free stairway and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who sworn from the punishment area.
At that time, the Rangers had had a long time of balbesitting, but the defense of the homeployment was inevitable and Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos provided that Kelly had to prevent a target.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the feet of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his colleagues from Livingston.
Continuingly, the penalty shipping area of Livingston was proposed, but they were warned every time. Two times a punishment cop was refused, one after Halkett's attack on the invasion of Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played outstandingly without exception and continue to pass the expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team has been almost changed since their return to the highest region, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swooped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defence, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall did walk on the top of their tens throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know by breaking.
Even though they have often played very well among Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only succeeded in swallowing the home plague) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classament.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between the NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left to Keulen for opening a giant new mosque.
Cologne is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called on safety reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from collecting themselves for the mosque, but many sympathisers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also heard their voice, condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and others are accused of as a autocrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies after collision with car
In London, a bicycler died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the cross point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy way in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died in place.
A few months ago another bike died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about half a mile from the accident of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and his next family.
The road is closed at different places, buses are redirected and cars are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six cipiers hurt in order disturbance
Six cipiers have been hurt in a order disturbance in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison agency.
The unlusts broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still running.
Specialized ‘Tornado’-cipiers have been set up to solve the situation, with eight prisoners involved in one section.
The ciphers were treated places for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the prisoner said: “It was specially trained prison staff for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible are in any case referred to the police and may have to remain behind the trails longer."
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 are caught, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the director of the prison was reported to have been treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the opera police were called to prison for a serious order disturbance in which staff were attacked with billions of balls.
Orcaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on drying areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy of orcaan Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert region, which brings risks of flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's expected to hang on Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday evening it'll be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a twin that ‘senior to 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles from the border of Arizona.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches, with isolated quantities up to 15 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Beck, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
The rain of Rosa can be a blessing for the areas that are not at risk of flooding because the region is affected by drying.
Although floods are very anxious, some of this rainfall will probably be favourable, because the southwest is currently drying.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drying areas are indicated, produces some more than 40 percent of Arizona at least extreme drought, the weather.com reported on a second highest category.
The trait of orcaan Rosa reaches the continent through the Baja California skiing island in Mexico.
Rosa is still on Sunday morning on orchestra strength with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving northwards at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens them.
That is why it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains may fall in parts of Mexico, which leads to a significant overflow risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass on Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
“The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her stairs is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert region," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruin flows in the deserts and earth shifts in mountainous areas.
An attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempt to kill after a 16-year-old with stiff wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at about 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has been under the commonness, the anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unpleasant and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been constantly 'under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party during his appointment procedure.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday to the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the crushing of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford has also witnessed her disturbance during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said that the “American people ” saw the beautiful and unbelievable character, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most full legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service," he told the multitude of prosecutors in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he talked about the importance of the Republican arrival at the intermediate elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our life.
I don't take part, but I actually take part," he said.
"That's why I'll come up for great candidates everywhere."
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to offer "resistance and barriers to us".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a top co-worker of the GOP Guide to CNN.
Hundreds of people died by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll grows higher
During a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, and many were blown away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six feet high struck on land at the time it began to swallow. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
“When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They didn’t walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Office for Aid for Natural Disasters GDP during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree tribes, houses with him, he touched everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he reached the coastline.
Some people climb in a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
At air photographs released by the Office for Aid in Natural Disasters, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained scattered by shocking.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb falling on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, small bath, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “respective” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
Some deadly victims were surely under the ruin of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage may be even greater along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala “Light completely flat, we have no information at all," said Nugroho.
There are over 300.000 people, ‘the Red Cross said in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said a tsunami Palu had hit, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
Amateur pictures shared on social media are hearing how a man on the top floor of a building shouts panicly to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water drops on the coast and is swallowed with buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a major power disturbance that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue practices.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami increases above 800.
It's very bad.
True, the employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in their office are looking for accommodation in tents of deck, but passing on the road toferels of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when auxiliary groups started the difficult commission to launch emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign providers with a great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and staff from abroad may not be authorised if the location of a disaster is called as a national natural disaster area.
That's not happening yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says, ‘Ok., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been exclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people hoped that they would recover their loved ones, such as in the miracles that people so much like to belong to horrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a kid was taken out of a riol.
On Sunday, helpers liberated a woman who had been arrested under the destruction two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had previously taken place in Indonesia this month.
His students were also firmly in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world I carry my own emotional tax," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the sporters in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one gray wing appeared instead of two blue wings.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during delivery of money automobile in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, 26,750 dollars were stolen by a Brink employee who was filling a money automobile in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just lying a money machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, so inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspicious flights, according to the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Whoever has information about the identity of the actors is asked to contact the Newport police on the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Faster changes his name to Ye
Faster Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which appeared in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his action on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singers Ariana Grande, who cancelled her action during the show for “emotional reasons”, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just a abbreviation of his current artist name. Previously, West told all that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yye', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at the radiopresentator Big Boy.
"So I am you, I'm us, we're it.
I've been skipped from Kanye, which means 'the only', to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is earlier a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference to the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly worked with West, has also worked with and without the link sign and the upper case.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the front of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprise against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968 military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration on the plenary, whereby up to 300 people were killed. In that period, left student movements came up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal bands due to unemployment and lack of study opportunities.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend to research A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this on the basis of the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced last year its plan: the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
"The budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I." Lee said.
A double of the funding can lead to a double of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. takes place in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionars.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
“China does not put our best akademics in, the companies do that,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best forces of universities to work at A.I..
Lee said that American efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“He who doctorates at the level of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the Defence Ministry of America established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to engage partners from industry and academic world in the initiative and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in the gate for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on possible change in their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia', with a dispute with Greece that has been pulled up for decades and would no longer hinder Greece from the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, saying that the name of its northern neighborhood means the country claims in Greek territory, and thus Greece put his veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the European Union and the NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slave majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 per cent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting note is formulated as follows: ‘Do you support the NATO membership and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Promotors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and the NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that have been created when the former Yugoslavia differed.
“I vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely among the paraply of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient parliamentary members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it determined.
The change in the name would require a second-third in the parliament.
The national election committee said that at 13 a.m. there had not been any reports of irregularities.
However, the rise at that time was only 16%, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered electors came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, during the referendum about the change in the name of the country that would open the way for membership of the NATO and the European Union.
For the House in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium and put chairs for tents that were placed by people who were the boycotten referendum.
"We are the supporter of the NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back port," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the membership of the NATO will provide essential investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the majority of us are more favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and the NATO,' said Zaev after the release of his vote.
He said that a 'yes' would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
From another peiling, carried out by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious attack on the policy of the pro-west government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passs full defense of Brighton and cart
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shortly met with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It seemed a flush of a cent, how Aguero scoorded in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spits first played the ball on the center.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, just in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defense and was too fast for some others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a passport to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the punishment area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judicial shoe to beat the targeter Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has trouble with his feet," coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a target at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Prime League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful staircase along the left flanken to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second palace.
The Sky Blues player ticked the ball just before he was too far.
City takes on Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase. The match takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and does not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now the Washington Nationals have eliminated for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They are currently a match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At least the Rockies have powered a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to put everything in work to ensure their first title.
“Of there is no more in it for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this public and the other team is likely to play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?'
The nationals must still announce who will be on Sunday, but are insisted that they are inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was on Thursday in the field and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
The right-handed caster of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organized meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he talked about the importance of the Republican arrival at the intermediate elections.
“All the things we've already achieved are in the game in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections takes place in our life.
This is one of the really big elections, but I don't take part, but I actually take part, so I'm going to come to great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they are determined to take the power back, regardless of what they should do for it, you see the commonness, the foolishness.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, who they must push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to offer "resistance and barrier to us".
"And we have seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "boos and common and false and lying".
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censur me, that was not surprising.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour parliamentary members who have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she resolutely came up against antisemitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for census because I was unaware of Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues as those where Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting was announced on Friday: ‘We want the meetings to be including and productive.’
And that was also so during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been local Labour parliamentary member.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of a 'pleasant, softer' politics if she had ever started.
It is increasingly clear that a deviating opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the partial leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy's leadership, collegas who, as long as I knew, had a similar political view as I, ever expected that I would turn back and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed, of subjects such as national security to the European unity market.
Every time I speak for a public, whatever I say, there are gaps on social media which are called on to reject my candidate time as a parliamentary member for the next elections, which reveal the centre's politics and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm doing.
In fact, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address are generally politics.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘move of mistrust’ or change of selection rules becomes the party smaller spirit.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to keep my mind grievous, not just to speak my opinion, and then I would ‘not come into trouble’.
But for that I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a schoolchild, I have been a member of Labour, provoked by the negligence of the Government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always asked for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role and in my congregation council member and in my role as minister.
I never kept my politics hidden, nor at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity on my policy positions and my controversial points with the current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that threats to reject my candidate time as a parliamentary member for the following elections, whether political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I believe is in your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unhappy Ayr on the way to the top
Two late tests may have drawn the end result somewhat shipping, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightly triumphs in this wonderful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're upstairs in the classament, the only uncovered team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better opportunities that the homeployer provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We have had it hard yet during our matches and we are still unhappy, so I am a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: “All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we.”
Grant Andersons try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a front for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National Plow (which he received during the Warriors' game) could Melrose speak the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a test.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra proximity for Ayr and scoorde a conversion after a solotry net for rest. It became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the front to five points.
The game was quiet for a serious bless of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a brancard, and once the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a test of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then commander Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again recalled Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed on a test of Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure was very high.
The homeployer, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow map because he attacked Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the arriving Ayr-maul for a touch-down to the penalty-line out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe kicked the box of David Armstrong and half-back Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth test of the homeployment.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It appears that Acteur Ford Kieran is going from Still Game in the horeca. It appears that he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craig is already planning.
According to official data, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'blooming restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country-included Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Zeelui patrols in a marine office in La Paz.
In public buildings, a sea blue flag wappers.
On all marine bases of the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is of us.
It's a duty to win them back."
In the entire country surrounding Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country has had to survive after a bloody 19th-century raw material conflict to Chile is still alive, just as the desire to rescue the Pacific again.
This hope may have reached its highest point of the last decade, since Bolivia is waiting for an opinion by the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will examine the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Den Haag will appeal to the benefit of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of pitty discussions, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is the next year for a controversial struggle for re-selection, is a great deal on the issue of Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he sworn at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is probably not going to decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if it was, there would be little changes.
The United Nations Organ established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the conclusions, indicates that the case was ‘not complex’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, contrary, the situation may have become even worse over the past four years.
‘The case around access to the sea has been caught by the current Bolivian government,’ said Zárate.
The wary retorics of Morales have all the good will that Chile may have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue with their discussions at a certain moment, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to speak afterwards.
The two countries have not been a ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Den Haag, denies that the decision of the court was unusually taken.
On Monday, Bolivia “will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“do an end to 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crook.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be on the point of restarting the firm nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the top meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a 'outopia' that the permanent sanctions and the American objections against a statement that ends the Korean war, North Korea will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang is first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second top meeting.
But there is scepticism, and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious if he says that he would dismiss a arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversize head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a remarkable seat during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their eye blinding creatures on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a four-like broad edge, which hanged over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were sealed, and they leaked more on Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like dive equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another on a smolten ice seemed.
And if you want to follow this tough fashion, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothes shops near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the strait hat with a two meters wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that popped up on social media everywhere also provided for another large creation on the catwalk: a beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathpack that the bag included.
The roodoran raffia bag, disposed of with raffia francs and finished with a white leather hang, was the most remarkable piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see future summer big hats and beach bags lie in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Talent skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a new series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30 000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independence schools are seeking to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a high-scale school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired fields in excellence in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a trust relationship with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are on the top of the range, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools attached to SCIS show that 72% of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72% of the students in German, 69% of the students in French and 63% of the students in Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as a professional choice as much as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
In 2014, an investigation by the British Employment and Features Committee showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling in vacancies were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now more and more jobs require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a advance in competition.
According to a YouGov peiling among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that exceeds 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investment in language education is now important to the children of today.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are engaged in providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
There is currently no denying that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, it's almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening bet before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's still necessary to determine how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a twot that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six matches before the season.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need any matches before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Periods of elections from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of electionsrallys
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that are affecting him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacation in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the coming intermediate elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late starts the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The Rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starting tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings of Applicant Supreme Board Kavanaugh this week. These were extra charged now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misbehavior and maybe the Senate will wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI examines the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidate for elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that the next week these five rallys are intended to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Delegates’, according to Reuters.
'Congress control is so important for its programme that the President is traveling to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season begins', said a speaker of the Trump campaign which was not intended to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally in the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia has visited, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the peelings.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the peelings," said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the race to the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chances is a fully invented sports concept, but a where players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances at present?
"They first had a precedent of six points, and now there are only four more, so we find a little that happiness is currently on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their seals, and there are many things that give courage, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tea to green, and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well, became higher as his round progressed and he made a crucial put that made four a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His well with which they won the match at 15 was followed by a similar cry, the kind of which you can distract that he believes that the American team has not been deceived yet.
“You have to dig deeply and just worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but glorious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only duo that didn’t play bogey on Saturday morning, on Friday morning, and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumourous audience, they are the players who have to be reported on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who books a European victory when the sun falls above Le Golf National.
Preferred both at the same time at different holes.
It is, however, premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a defense for the Spanish and the Swedish which they no longer got over.
However, Sunday there is no one who can help to get your back.
The four balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see by the interactions between the duo's, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a beautiful front in the beginning of the last day, but this foursome session has also demonstrated that Team USA is willing to go on the fight, something that some, especially in the United States, doubts.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful front on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand at 10-6 on the United States.
The enchanted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had it difficult, and now they have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to lose the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer get his back.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday in order to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that four points win in their four opening games.
After they made Woods and Patrick Reed into the four balls, they were beautifully enrolled and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who swallowed himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed a beautiful place, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of 's mornings, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, and together they slew Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet, it didn't lie from a leather roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a brize to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after they lost the first four holes.
It has only happened twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to obtain a backstand of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furich has enough to play equal, since they are currently having the trophy in hands.
But since they've been in the second place for two days, it seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will unilaterally disarm in no case without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuous penalties result in increasing unfaithfulness in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not give up its nuclear weapons in any case.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ in the last year, such as the stopping of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of the location of nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.” he said.
"With no confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no case unilaterally disarmament."
Though Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation, which would be rewarded as the further steps take, it was not pointed out that he disapproved the unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the 'deucclarisation of the Korean Shield Island', while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea aims at a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed against calls to facilitate the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. calls for 'deunclearing first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a forced manner and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
“The perception that penalties can bring us on our knees is a air slot of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader did before the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: ‘If the other party was in this issue of declaration South Korea and not the United States, the deuclearisation of the Korean island would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he said the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the US continent would be directed after ‘Mr Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘raketman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened last year to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim this year with the United Nations to take his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to happen and that sanctions should remain to North Korea decline.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘If it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the Security Council of the UN Pyongyang should reward the steps taken.
However, the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and definitely until we have realised the complete, definitive, verified declaration.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has carried out unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's programmes for nuclear and ballistic rockets.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea confirmed him of setting 'pass-star requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to decompose a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘conform measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘conform measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow courses on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study throughout the night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Harvard Medical School, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He was given the idea of starting the course after having given a talk about the influence of sleep shortage on learning.
'On the end of my speech, a girl came to me that said, 'Why can I just hear this in my last year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is first organised this year, explains the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve the akademic and athletic performance and how they promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the University decided to organize the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee shops, gardines, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deficiencies, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants hear how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus ground, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that with this we will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice for cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
Studying the culture of fierceness on a nail still exists, he says, and by modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are an increasing problem.
He said, and even to avoid weight increase, because sleep shortages ensure that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course last year. He had followed lessons with the professor when he studied with Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set a alarm for their bedtime and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” of electronic monitors and leather lighting, which can disregard your circucadiaan rhythm, allowing you to have an effort to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to undermine Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their struggle again disappointingly passed when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak plague swallowed with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox has been hoping for a first victory during a struggle since they deceived 4-1 in February St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's ploeg took care of the defeat, nearly the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team is now behind eight points on Hearts, which runs further to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scoorded in seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalmaker.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently a object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to half the finales of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh for Livingston, who knew the Hearts to suck a point last week. He would have been enthusiastic about the way his well trained plague had blocked the opponents at each turn.
The Rangers may have had the most ballbes, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga first left the ball and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the victory, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free stairway from Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow shot against the rear palace.
The Rangers did succeed in taking over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
In any case, Alfredo Morelos felt that he had the right to a punishment cop when he and Steven Lawless were in the battle after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was the former targetman at the Ibrox, was able to stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tomb shot of Ovie Ejaria with comfort.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
The Rangers were not rewaxed again against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and chose Menga, who walked the ball in the goal.
Gerrard provided an interruption with the exchange Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This turn had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a match that Livingston loves to play, while Lithgow and Halkett continue to stab long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its proximity in the last stage of the match, but McGregor stopped well and blocked Jacobs, afterwards Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the match for a punishment ship after an expedition with Jacobs, but Thomson looked again on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named geiger teller.
The Geigerteller has not been thinking away from science since then, and also became an icon in the popculture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What is that in god’s name?’
Rogers: “It is a geiger teller, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms issued by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "It's really knocking now!"
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, nearly a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that holds his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see malicious cells’
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malicious cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify malicious cells in the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a labo
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells saw her ovarian anchor disappear more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the labo are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2 that often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "From our results, we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and brain cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to “learn” these cells to treat cancer cells was to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Canye West leaves pro-Trump-tirade and carries MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Canye West was awarded during a shipment of Saturday Night Live after an inadvertent act in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would be presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with on his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he put a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“Popularly when I talk to a white one, he asks: ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
If I worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
The shipment of Saturday Night Live began with a parodie in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon put the dragon with the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senates Committee on Justice in relation to the supposed assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The Tyrade of West was not sent out, but comics Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained against the public that he was taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“They toughened me backstage.
They said, "Don't go on the podium with that pet."
They hurt me!
And then they say I'm apathic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Will you see how apathically it looks?” He said that he would attract them superman-cape, “for that means you cannot command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
From the public, at least twice, the castle members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by an attendant: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacer of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an implementation of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who argued: “To one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANCED THAT YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.”
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter argued that West was just "always himself, and that's beautiful."
“But I choose to reward someone who is injuring, supporting and spoiling my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art').
He's free to do what he wants.
We too', she added to it.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, “the creature that formally is known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist who changes his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-raper Snoop Dogg has also behaved the name Snoop Lion and the deceased musical legend Prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then known as Prince in The Artist.
An accusation of attempts to kill after stiff party in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to murder after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complainant is expected to appear for the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington extracts to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role of Sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy arch Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actress draws out to the stereo type of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such rolls on the screen, they often think they need to be stronger to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he finds that “there is something wrong” and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic mality in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who was recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me at present: where has it failed with our maleness?" he said.
"What have we learned men when they grew up, so we are faced with this problem now?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleity, because of his very male personalities.
He continued: ‘What is born and what is learned?’
What is learned on TV and on streets that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's major questions: how do we change that?
For something has clearly happened for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games or Thrones when the series next summer has ended, because he is "clear with battle fields and horses".
From November on, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an attacker.
The actress recently revealed that he finds his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the series, so that's how I kept my future family and my life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits characterage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The group was married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported that the number of Chinese HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted by sex, which was not the case before.
Hiv has quickly spread in some parts of China by transfusions of infected blood in the past.
But the number of people in this way HIV is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal since 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
The conservative values of the country are estimated to be 70 to 90% of the men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The diseases are often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff employee has leaked data from Republican senators and extracts to ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
The U.S. Congreslid Maxine Waters is opposed to the accusations that one of its staff employees has placed the personal data of three American senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawgivers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by ‘extreme-right bets’ and websites.
“Leagues, lies and more common lies”, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misbehavior to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators Kavanaugh had interrogated.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that the source of the posts indicates linked to the Waters office and contained it the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unjust accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised due to these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking of this information.
This unfair accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The statement of Waters has already run to criticism online, including by former press worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds evil', said Fleischer.
“You can find out that she does not have the temperament of being Congreslide.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the motives of the complainant.
He must stay calm and calm."
Fleder appeared to compare the Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, accused by criticism of excessive evil during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Hifty, if it is true," he twisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement bodies of these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the actors become known,” she said, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English-franchise, the comic action movies with a relaxed spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was revoked in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy evenatriate about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with extinguishing eyes and flexible facial attractions, at least, succeeds in sending everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already distract that he is a general comic character that was thought for bioscope entrants in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim on smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a vleugle Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson ever played in the Barclaycard TV spots (which everyone has been forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor leaves a little bit against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this movie how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak over and crazy enough excessive, especially now the "serious" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible self comedie as ingredients, and do well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and the delicious disaster of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused on than the jokes without text of the character of Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network on the web, which has become known to the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to great degradation of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the emmer run over by the first minister, a pretensive woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as politics. Emma Thompson is doing her best with this characteristic that makes Teresa May think of, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to its information advisors, she must set up a retired spione, since each active spion is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English itself, who now works as a school master in a chique institution, but inappropriate lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spionage lessons of English are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly offered on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former sad help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a captain of a undersea, an incredible and jovian role under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Unfortunately, the first minister falls to the charms of the charismatic technology billionary who claims that he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssee of climbing magnificent fun: dressed as obers they put a sensible French restaurant in fire, they shove herrie on board the luxury hunting of Volta and English decline pure anarchie when he trys to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself trusted with the interior of Volta's house.
Lastly, all the registers are opened, but how well meant and disgusting the scene is, they do what thinks of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: Can the British film sector really not think of a role that affects Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is recalling a plan in which British work four days a week but are paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British work four days a week but are paid for five days.
Accordingly, the party would like companies' bosses to pass on the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance overlap towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek has already been approved by the Federation Association, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-placed source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one moment at the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more for the benefit of employees and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 country election campaign.
However, the full Labour Party has not yet supported the efforts.
A speaker of the Labour Party said, "A four-day week of work is not a party's policy plan, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the 'sightless drivers' and the 'profits' in nuts companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'abbreviations' on the basis of observed misbehavior.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to establish inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) with a view to giving 10% of the shares of private enterprises to the employees that can thus earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the investigation from the FBI to Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could cause them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, inclined."
The voice of Graham, however, seems to be stuck.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"What Dr. Ford concerns, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called her could verify it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organised in New York, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will occur and that knows an even impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Law in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international interest managers who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concerting members who wanted to authorise a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as voluntary work, e-mail a world leader, conduct a telephone conversation or create other meaningful awareness for the purpose: a end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just a different form of 'clicktivism', giving people the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have recorded more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the use of world leaders and to make policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars that have to change the life of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of the actions, which have been paid out at least $10 billion or brought together by sponsorships.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have hitherto had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
The main incentive statements are those of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realise their full potential. This group has promised 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end undernaught in the country after they received more than 4,700 twots from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national authorities and of global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is undernaught a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In answer to one of the many questions on the website of the Global Citizens, which was asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
replied to the group, "It will be a long and difficult way, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and the anti-apartment movements before us, we will finally be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will act this year during the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may engage in a 'blockade' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Ministry of Domestic Affairs
Washington may have been "required" to the marine in order to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister for Inland Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts on the invitation of the legal government, is a predecessor of exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the marine, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to invited ones during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit-minding point that defishes himself as the 'Voice of the Energy Consumment' in the U.S.
He went on and compared Washington's Russian approach with Iran's approach and noted that these were not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said and moved to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art' with a economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a moment that the Trump Government is trying to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump Government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw view from the 'unsuited' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to the Trum of Berlin, has made the 'caught' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexander Novak, the Russian Energy Minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has led to a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the Tuning Industries Organisation in Germany, called on the US to avoid intervening with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third power involves our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Federal Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Canselier Angela Merkel and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said Saturday that she's thinking seriously about it to take part in the presidential elections after the intermediate elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also involves a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll consider it seriously to make me preferable as President."
Warren runs against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm up to the bone to make what Donald Trump brings in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a twoth on Friday Warren said, "Of course, we need to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on this."
However, an opinion published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own follow-up finds that it should not be preferable in 2020.
Eight fifty percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be preferable, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-twenty percent of them were that she would be preferable.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a possible candidate and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said that he would make a decision officially in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took his service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son should experience, what he gets when he is back, I have understanding for other families who experience the effects of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return" she told the public who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other soldiers have given for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, intervening in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police vocabulary in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims who are refugeeing for violent violents or for domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday as a friend of the Court in support of an asylum seeker who fights this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union has made adherence to the federal policy in August has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a band" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's a prisoner in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the U.S. as countries that are familiar with major problems in the field of bands and domestic violence.
The United States' new asylum policy has reverted a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, where it was possible for immigrants without documents flying for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the prosecutor-general of Washington D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy ignores "decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such obstacles are contrary to that principle" in the statement of the 'friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that rejects immigrants access to the United States damages the economy of the United States, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'foresee the necessary employees'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Ministry of Justice, commanded judges to no longer asylum to victims of domestic and engagement-related violence.
"Asyl is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief" said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never intended to ease all the problems, even if these are serious, with which people get to do every day, everywhere in the world.
Wrong savings in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation also became worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her fever baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is hard."
Inhabitants returned to their devastated houses and searched for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of severe naskins.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accused China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper put an ad of four pages in an American newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were praised, the U.S. ambassador in China was accused of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump was last referring to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the US Congress elections of 6 November, a accusation denied by China.
Trumps accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene with the elections in the United States, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an ascending campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, in which they have increasingly raised each other import prices.
China's reimbursement rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Trump Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and formerly governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, " now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertising in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China makes use of the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-earned tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register" wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find abnormal voices and will not see a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the inch of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he did not say what newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans disfellowshipped female electors just for the intermediate elections, warned analists
Now many important Republicans are sharpening around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, warn analysts that they will experience a relapse, especially among women, during the ongoing intermediate elections.
The emotions around this subject have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already told them that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering whether the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to prompt for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to satisfy the evil electors.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November comes to it!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans who chose the Justice Committee to approve the candidate time of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"Men say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue to go further, especially among the floating female electors in the foreign and younger electors, from 18 to 29 years old, which often do not vote even if they do not agree with the president."
Even for the public witness of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the High Court, analyzed analysts suggested that a relapse could be followed if the Republicans would persist the appointment.
"This has become a confused ruin for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it is also the way the Republicans have done this and how they have treated it," makes Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, a group who helps Democrats to be elected, clear to the news channel.
The Americans, however, appear to be divided about the question who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority declined to the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe the witness of Ford and that 35 percent certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was sure or likely lying during his witness while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the plan of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford stated last week to the Senate Court Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drink when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a festival when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new Internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Invasion, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world dominion' is the leading thought behind Interrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
In this lists of contacts, lists of activities, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it fully depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment by means of data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Invasion is that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
From this week, developers of technology across the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the website of Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation, making all their business models completely headed."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inruption) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he built the World Wide Web Consortium to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an impressive voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Also after the start of Inruption, Berners-Lee will stay as a builder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added to this.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergy of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honour Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had fallen the highest British military honor.
An anniversary stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'briljant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his bataljon on 29 September 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field fire and machine guns".
Later he rushed through to the fireline and led the line forward before only running to a field shoot and disabled three members of the detection.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on 4 October 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions "was something, which I know I can never tip it, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, have also laid a crane after the parade that was guided by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see a follow-up Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
On the chart from San Jose, 13 struggles were listed, including six in the main section, and this was sent out all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, sighters in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignated because they had stayed alert all night specially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke."
"In accordance with the government's regulation, no longer should be shown content that is not suitable for children after 6:00 a.m., so we had to switch to the child programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yess.
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said they're going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the back fight, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the change, a lot of messages went back and back and believe me, these weren't all kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We restricted the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleanspringer Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual nature, but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to further education, he did not realize that "not everyone is as I am".
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to less value gain during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has released a few months because of disease.
It appeared as a creature on the first programme of Laverne, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'minder' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to enjoy both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "one" so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally came behind his nature.
The winner of two bronzes Olympic Medailles has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used its presence in the Common Beast Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he thought he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-month world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, he met in 2013, "I have been completely surprised."
Daley married the Oscarwiner, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group that has experienced the same height and lowest points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic Medailles.
My Golden Olympic Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had been asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I stopped his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing really stomached and he died, I could finally recognize that he was not uncomfortable," he said.
The next year Daley joined the Olympic Games of 2012 and won bronzes.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life. Dipping for a home public during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had attacked him strongly on the way to the games and where he still got chickens.
Desert Island Discs can be listened on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to see his shape back to make no sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the drive range, in an attempt to find out where it is going to break.
Since he was never known for his right drives even on the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the rough-drawn balls penalizes routineus.
And if the job in itself is not awkward enough yet, Mickelson comes in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newling Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start, the match of Mickelson may be absolutely crucial.
Furich has proved to be trusted in this man, even though he could honestly say hardly differently.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back, slammed his arm around me and said that he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but this week too.
I probably didn't expect him to play just two matches.
I had expected more of it, but it's just like it is, and it's the way we have to act.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely seen the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 matches on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain impressive influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to pick out jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained, so.
"I think the younger players liked him sometimes too for the crazy last week, which was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than his only game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advances can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danes made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as captain Seven Ballesteros had a front of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great front in Valderrama; we had a great front in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, cancelled here, after he had seen the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a front of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet played game.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go on and carry out the plan at the right time.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy wins, and we must keep focusing on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Beautiful about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go forward to the matters in this area.
Tomorrow's waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow, individual performances are ongoing, and that is a very different discipline.
It's great to be running out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're only standing for it, your capabilities as a golfer are not really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he's got to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furik himself has experience with both sides of this type of conversion on the last day, as a member of the winner team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had raised his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We voted our line-up on this and sent the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat to magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to try to guide the counteroffensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new German warship is deferred again
The latest fregate of the German Marine should have come into service in 2014, to replace the older warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The operation of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the gloed new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregatten, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that a military speaker quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the marine in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete fregates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air-wear and anti-ship rockets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest fregates up to two years behind, far away from home ports.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project their power overseas, have been older at the time they are taken into operation, notes The Time.
The deadly fregat F125 has already reached the newspaper heads last year, when the German marine officially refused to operate the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was used in a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, half the male force on the fregates of the older Bremen class.
It was also evident that the ship has a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the maritime potential to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rhineland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were launched by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price map for the complete project, including the training of the crew, becomes also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a disturbing €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2 billion.
The problems of the latest fregates in their grip are particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German marine declines.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, recognized that the marine actually has a "manufacturable deficit".
The official said that the problem of time as a snowball has grown because old ships were removed from the company but no substituting vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were still available to be included in the marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flair mice
New research carried out on a landstock in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how flair mice use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will make new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the regular and small dwarf wing mice, the brown large wing mice and the water flair mice at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the landscape to follow the activities of the flag mouse through the season.
Co-workers of the NTS and volunteers are also going to carry out mobile studies using manual detectioners.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crying of the flair mouse and what kind of what is doing.
Then a map of habitats and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results show which areas of habitats are the most important for flair mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making weeds and how to maintain the forests best for flair mice and similar species.
Fleer mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly declined in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as flying captures and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by housecatches.
Flight mice are not blind in reality.
However, by their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares on land in the country, is taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, carry out sleep inspections and sometimes rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for flager mice in Scotland at the estate of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of wing mice in Scotland lives.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the landscape is the ideal territory for the flag mouse.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for flakes," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much not yet known about flair mice and therefore the work we do here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to be able to threw."
He emphasizes the importance of control of flair mice before maintenance activities are carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping site can lead to the death of 400 female flair mice and their boys, making it possible to eradicate a full local population.
Flight mice are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall in trouble or to break down or to destroy their places of sleep.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn much about our flair mice and of many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects complaints of assault while his lawyers prepare to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'fair news' and said that people want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are about to appeal to the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is accused of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to silence about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the accusations were reported, called the reports 'fair news'.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I am a happy man, and through and through well" the footballer added to this, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo prepare a case in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The supposed incident was reported in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the footballer's room, where he raped her anal according to the accusation, as read in the accusation submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and he told her he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but sometimes he was abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple of people had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an outright arrangement because she was 'bang for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to let the scheme be invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed attack and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will always regret' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will be ever sorry' if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of auto-production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister for Economic Affairs.
He added to this the 'pleasant' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would suspend production temporarily in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese automobile producer said that the impact of delays at the border would be costing in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150.000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My view is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory falling down," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also revealed their fears of the consequences of a EU dispatch without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already made known that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where each 37-minute part arrives from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruption at the limits which, according to industry, may lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
Toyota cannot store in stock more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, so let the company know, and therefore production would be stopped in that case.
Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU has been ‘exactly agreed to avoid these controls at the border’.
"We must have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success but also take this chance," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chain."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned at the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and that representative of the Unit of Faculty at the Facility, said that his members are increasingly concerned, "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they never come back again.
A public speaker said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the adjunct procureur-general Rod Rosenstein can be suspended a week, while the fight about the candidate for the High Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special charger Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of elections, relations between Trump's assistants and Russians and possible barriers to legal action by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the adjunct procureur-general and thus put Mueller in danger of independence, the Washington roddel machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to establish conversations with Trump and to dispose of the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied your report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the rumors made that he was about to serve his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'not ever', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would witness both.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out a week's investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the Chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is not yet a date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders have not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the slightest of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'conceived' newspapers, though, she added to this, "I won't deny that they're trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President is doing more question and answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without proof of this, "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do that much and you have often seen us do that in recent weeks and that will take place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visited.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president might demonstrate why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister for Health and Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees from NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Ministry of Health wrote a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the wish that they should continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have declared themselves willing to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have been continued, and this autumn will take the expected decisions.
At the same time, however, the UK authorities also suspended the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this should be insecure times for you all.
That is why I would like to stress the appreciation of the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all EU and outside, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the NHS' work and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes a speed operation after main injury
The tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was a speed surgery yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the game lost by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly for rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell in there a little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the side line before they put him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operation room in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/ magnitude of the injury and Tennessee State are trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophorie', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tricked up on Saturday five times before leaving the field, so he was tricked up to 18 times this season.
External buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK
External buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK and use the yield to help the daklos according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in the leaks is attributed to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finances expects this to raise £ 120 million a year to help the daklos
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK and use the extra yield to help the daklos, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young electors with promises to ensure more affordable houses and to stories this on multi-payers.
The increase in the leaks is charged to persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra yield in an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The contribution, which is at the top of the current empty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three per cent.
In this way, the Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which drives prices and is difficult for launchers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many welfare areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practical 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had petitioned for a reduction in the empty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices high by buying land and not using this, and he called May to cancel quotas on payable houses to restore the 'home investment damage' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a prominent series of housing reforms, including leasing ceilings and a termination of 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
May said, "I said last year I wanted to spend my time as first minister to restore the British Dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market must be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be so easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British inhabitants.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become a too vain dream, and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has already become too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's 'implicit ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in the third place in League One, at three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after he brought back the previous season of St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer I already wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B team and thereby the cow was off" told Ross to Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw with my father Scotland often play in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps me dressing.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are measured at this moment by "Can I let this club return to the Prime League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly supposed to be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring back the club there."
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period as a assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a cruise point," he remembered the time when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it all right, I deserve quite well and have known a few reasonable highlights.
But footballs can be heavy.
There are many things that you face weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and since I'm real, I'm so well in my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in summer has made the incomes rise from British pubs who are trying to survive but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, from the Business Advisory Office CGA, who collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected part in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had turned 2.8 percent more, with that difference that the restaurants were now getting harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at the sale of drinks are far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also directed to the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people just went out for drinking.
In pubs and bars under management, drink sales were 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outgoing market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent on year is particularly painful in view of the continuous cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse moment for the operators who are focusing on food and will only learn the time or give the more moderate temperatures of August the necessary respeed."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a shared turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account for social media that they keep hidden for their parents
One of the five children, some not elderly than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Study of 20 000 students from secondary schools revealed growth in "false Insta-pages"
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say to have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years old, accounts for social media that they keep hidden for adults.
A 20 000 student survey revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while they still have personal accounts.
A mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter at random discovered a teenager who asked others to rape her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them had to keep on personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive Director at the General Annual Meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland at work and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the drivers of the sport to learn of her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from its election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am glad to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and can help manage the sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic Medailles, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could not go after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I am now fully restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the supporting statements!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an advertisement in which sowing mothers are compared to cows that are smoked.
In order to highlight the introduction of what is called the most silent portable breast pump in the world, Elvie, the producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired ad on music videos in order to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to colling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled sheath on a song that contains texts like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it" and "If you didn't watch it, these are not uiers, these are my breasts."
The refrein then continues with: "Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has immediately provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that this is the 'horror' of the milk industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
As we are, they must be expected to produce milk, but in their case the babys are taken away within a few days after the birth."
Elvie's breast pump fits discreet in a nutrition beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is naturally traumatic to mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babys?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I find this a genial idea.
I'd buy one if I still had a breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling to be a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genial product" wrote someone.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a fun ad, focused on mothers who are polling (sweeper on the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like to be 'cows'.
This ad is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pollow sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is fully silent, has no wires or serpents and fits discreet in a nutrition condition, so that women have the freedom to move, keep their babys and even go out while they are on pollen.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserved a strong and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between coaling mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the plunger and the associated challenges in the scenarios and at the same time show how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time the pump of Elvie takes the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children still moved to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of immigrant children has reached a peak, even though the number of monthly cross-borders has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh retoric and the hard-feeding policy introduced by the Trump Government makes it more difficult to put children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by logging in for a child.
This risk has increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households have to issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization arrested tens of people who have notified themselves as sponsor for undirected minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons had no preliminary penalty.
"Bijna 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're up to persecution these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to deal with the children faster, officials introduced new rules, which make some of them obliged to appear to the court within one month after the start of the arrest, instead of within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shelter
Many of them will be at the court through a video conference, instead of in person, to request a legal status for a immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in prison, the greater the chance of being anxious or depressed, which can cause violent outbreaks or flight efforts, according to the shelter employees and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more frequently ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for this emotionally or to say absent to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them have already struggled with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey's 'occupational power' be withdrawn immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-Premier, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian ground, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be done accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been rooted and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred fight until we have released all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly working on training and counselling of the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country rubbed by war.
With regard to the refugees Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he refuses to 'spread some Western countries irrational fears' which leads most refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politics a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomas say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important ballwork of the rebels, has created the possibility of starting political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has declined a large-scale attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action will focus on jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, which will be 'should be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, UN Member, hopes to gather the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a Constitution for after the war for Syria and to open up the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted 'to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second deadline
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidentship is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In some doubt, the most dramatic final of a presidentship would ever be.
At this moment, however, there are no signs of sightlessness.
Since 2014, watch figures during 'prime-time' at CNN have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost threefolded to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time' compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said when, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovell told me.
It's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to all the other on TV, the story lines from Washington can influence or determine whether immigrant families can reunit or affect the status of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it goes beyond a well-informed citizen wants to be, when you get in mind that you've been looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which it talks about the jack of Paul Manafort's pope learning that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overwhelming' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show, is partly that he stops you something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a struggle with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford you to miss a delivery or you have the idea you're walking behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside looking at MSNBC while he opened CNN.
He could not escape the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear for the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the High Court that was at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that the people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it shows that they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting intermediate elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a re-establishment of a electoral district in which two sitting national representatives must fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which knows a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymanding') in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knocking party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Demokratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nineth victory in a well-looked special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered to punish El Salvador for support to China and has declined from this
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners released the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to revoke the U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore', said Heather Nauert, the ministerial speaker, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were considered only in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with a large unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings went through, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up at a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But half September, some top officials from the government informed that they wanted the conference to continue and thus made all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a speech at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance of the government's award to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three American messengers have been returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a hard message about Washington's penalties.
A speaker of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomates, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke under conditions of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the special charger Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the Trump justice, which has now become public.
Mueller's research is probably also aimed at cohesion between Trump's and Russia's campaign in an attack from Russia on our elections.
When the Congress changes color, Trump must account for that institution, just as he makes himself ready to turn to the electors again, and maybe he must be responsible for a jury in a court.
This is a lot of mystery, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices, which will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had commanded resistance and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thereby missed an opportunity to prevent the years of blood forgotten that followed.
The course of history turns around such benchmarks and the unforbidden march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of this type of benchmarks.
What will we do if Trump adjunct-president-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of the investigation of Mueller, fails?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he had suggested, last year, to take up conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says that the report of the Times is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair witness?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a Congress that will call Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech jøde who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me away to pitch for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastic was represented.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
Through a kneeblessure, the middle fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the results as a jump plank for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good elevental," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something to win fell and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but over the whole game a equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better plough.
The coming Thursday is a new large European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard game because they also had a good result in their last match. But when the public is behind us, I'm sure we can continue to print and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened with my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now persist, leave the last season behind us and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to get care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the National World Research said they talk to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"Men want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your husband(o)t(e) and the children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't make your wishes well available at time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenditure.
Your long-term long-term financing choices may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or use the own assets as insurance as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance is to be launched.
Take care of a full power for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that professionals keep your wishes in case you are no longer able to communicate.
Consider also a full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this anymore.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hits a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so you have the information manually.
"It's not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
One shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a air pressure gun when he walked home after a little night.
The victim, forty plus, was located in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, stomach and hand.
Agents describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "willing act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the number of deaths will increase further.
Since the means of communication are disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the rainy of Donggala, a region north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the crew with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster has occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central-Celebes and is located at the end of a small bath on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the tsunami fell.
Donggala is a rainy stretching over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rainship, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the Central-Celebes Province, particularly in the coastal area of Donggla.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been frequently hit by tsunamis in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disasters Protection Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pasific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on the north of Sumatra, on 26 December, provided a tsunami that has hit 14 countries and has spent a total of 226.000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a power of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that slew on the south coast and demanded almost 700 lives.
2009: A earthquake with a power of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: A earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands, before the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and demanded around 300 human lives.
2016: A deep earthquake hit the rainship of Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people found death through collapsed buildings.
2018: Multiple earthquakes found the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made it possible for thousands of tourists to be temporarily beached.
An elderly son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, was arrested on charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 out of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, incorporating a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female familiar tried to call the police to report the claimed crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in prison in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a deposit trip of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when he was asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged for three infringements of class A, which means that he can be condemned to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250.000.
He is also charged for an infringement of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the supposed abuse.
This case is now served by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of a mistreatment in the home atmosphere, incorporated a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon affected by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016, after having linked her son’s violent behaviour to PTSS, that he would have left his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expectation is that the death rate will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circular videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal chargers require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal chargers in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terreur attack in New York City, where eight were killed, a rare penalty that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the accusation, used a rented truck from Home Depot to accommodate an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in which he traveled pedestrians and bicyclers who came on his road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has deliberately killed the eight victims and has seriously caused physical injuries, according to the incentive statement in which the death penalty is required, which was submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both complaints, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight complaints of murder for a racket, typically an accusation used by federal chargers against organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the accusators and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'great, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevits Sajpov has injured, damaged and lost to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the intence declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York, a matter of death was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally condemned to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after two years earlier being condemned for spionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not prove wrath in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the inspectors he felt well about his deed, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the police.
He did not claim to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said that he is 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the accused parties.
"We think that the decision to demand death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a lifelong prison without the possibility of reimbursement, only will extend the trauma of these events for all stakeholders," said Patton.
The defence of Sajpov had earlier asked the accused parties not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a people army at a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'hite' of the Eurosceptists, while one of their own parliamentary members of Theresa May proposed to give him the lead of the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK would have been 'out' as Mr. Farage Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge of May in the reconciliation of the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers compromis on the ride while attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Consultants persuaded that she will continue and will try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the disasters, and thus force Eurosceptists and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihul that he wanted to throw 'Chequers in the roller'.
He proposed that Farage should be riddled and should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he made the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Wellingborough parliamentary member added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the roller basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone pointed out suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its opinion and wants to remain in the EU is completely false."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in March and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular in the public, the opposition is not for vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Presidents keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hite' if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political classes," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them "we don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and closed this March with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists swing with flags on which Tories was against Brexit, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Superior House, made jokes about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants 'to go well to think' about candidates for presidentship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to think good about her candidate time for the presidentship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wishes to be reselected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who was co-president of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculations that she may be going to fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attended asked her if she would be preferable for the presidentship.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died of the consequences of it," said Police Commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been investigated and has known to have been present in the place of crime, to be in possession of a gun and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1,98 metres that grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas graduated before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders of Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton ride in the pressed stairs of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits around later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton returned to the head after a wheel-op-wheel action, making the Ferrari rider with opposition to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed at his banding choice and mixed on fast finish, so that he could get Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went into the 44th round to the pits, after he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became the fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and left me over.
The team has done his best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculated Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she was not obliged to be the source of the elected letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate was accused of attack by the High Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly share the witness given by Ford for the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he pointed out that what was done in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unfair and unfaithful'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are wrathful and common and common and inconvenient and unfaithful," he said.
"When you look at the press messages and the leaks and they then say, 'Oh, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
You remember her answer... you've leaked the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the accusations were mentioned to the address of Kavanaugh were sent to Feinstein sent by Ford, which was lectured in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially and I treated it confidentially as she asked."
But the president proved not to believe her denunciation and he commented at the meeting on Saturday evening, "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Furthermore, with the defence of the candidate for the High Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back, with all necessary resources.
You see the commonness, the innocentness, they don't give anything to who they hurt, about whom they should drive to take the power and get the control back," the President would have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier with two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the homeployment along the side before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalmaker for Dundee, before Luke Lundvald Nielsen with two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make a resignation on Friday evening to beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time of this season that the two teams met each other, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening gold of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on a assist of Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistance that Beauvillier doubled the front, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the homeploeg to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the idea for the comparator of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest with a front, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The homeployment reappeared and Bouchard brought them again on an equal stand with a power-play gold at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made it possible for a plane with hundreds of people to rise safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful nashoes still harass the area and many are buried under the point of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-wear moving trafficstores of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready at that time on the starting course, could be safely risen.
Then he was jumped out of the trafficstores when he thought it was invaded.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can increase to the thousands and gave the country's body know that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the number of deaths is still increasing because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Agency.
Flowers reaching a height of six feet have destroyed Palu, where a lot of funeral ceremony will be maintained on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and stocks.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Every minute is brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is hard.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has been enrolled in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will happen.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday, and he said to the present soldiers: "I call on you all to work day and night so that all tasks that are necessary for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with more than 550 people.
Fly crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after an crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried the flight crashed in a Pacific lagune in Micronesia now says that one other man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the sunken plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press report that is missing a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked together with the local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped the rescue of the other passengers and crew members after the plane had been watered during the landing on the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events, remains at the moment unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the landing course has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the landing course.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he and some others succeeded in the water, which came to their means, to wade to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardessens were panic and shouted and that he had a non - serious head wound.
The U.S. Marine announced that seelui who were working in the vicinity of a yard also helped with the rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a blowable boat before the plane sank further in the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last 20 years, 111 people have found death in crashes of airlines registered at the PNG but that is not related to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his claim on Friday in the reopening process of a man who is accused of living burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours of witness as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used the phone call data to fix the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left the life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers at the evening of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police began to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told him he wasn't in the city that day.
When the complainant asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he told me he was in his truck at Sanford during that night, Sanford said that he was "laughing because my truck was then in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the messages, calls and contact details from his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says that hiphop is distinguished from the origin of political opinions and the map of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a new experience in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A young girl from New York will make a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A young girl from New York will take a couple for the judge for a dismissal for discriminatory reasons after receiving a misleading text in which the mother had the complaint about 'this black again'.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the case 'depressing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroide woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEEE WEERE ZO'N SWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she only sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper de New York Post, the Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice felt uncomfortable when she realized her blunder. She explained that her former child-maid, who was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple for the court to get a compensation of $350,- per day for the 6 months for which she was rented to bivacuate internally in the family, or without contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they were afraid of not trusting her anymore.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.
Concerning the case with 'depressing', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathic," added the investment banker.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion is quick to chapter the couple on social media, where it is enthusiastic for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have a lot of interest in a speaking beer, revealing newly raised letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It is difficult to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, still for the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's huge success, it's very easy."
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the child book on a small toy bear, when cameraman worked at the British Sender BBC, was optimistic about or his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
"But because Paddington was so vivid for him, it seemed almost like a child's performance; you're proud while you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington so much.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say it by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors forgively tried to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected not to get it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to take asked from her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pomping, slowly developed and left her body.
She died a while before, and this process disabled everything further.
I could just sit there, knowing what all was going on.
I couldn't be sorry, screaming or crying, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to be great."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved about the death of her daughter, went in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of what trial she had to bear.
"No one knew it," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears continued to come.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Rawing women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make themselves strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any older person to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English district Gloucestershire, says that her son was a promising chief coke with a crying cry.
"He was familiar with his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he already stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that a chain reaction will come."
Mrs Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was 15 years her partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt stupid or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all on the ground on First Christmas - when the children packed out their gifts, he didn't look at them or so at all."
She said that his death was a great trauma before she was, but that they should treat it, "It's gonna break the whole family apart.
It's gonna distinguish us.
But we all have to continue and continue fighting."
If you are fighting for life, you can call free of charge with the 'Samaritans', in Great Britain and Ireland they are accessible at the choice number 116 123 (+44 for GB, and +353 for Ireland), or (send) email to jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future insecure while FBI starts research
'I thought that if we could actually get what he asks, a periodic and scale-limited investigation, we might be able to create a little more unity,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, which he added to, that he was afraid that the committee was falling out of each other, in the middle of a strongly anchored patch within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The intermediate elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November, and, as expected, the Republicans are seriously difficult to do so, their attempts to get their husbands chosen in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to make the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh for the High Court.
Number of overflowers in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawyer, the number of North Korean overlopers has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of University, declares that last year there were 1.127 overlaps compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher punishments for human smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The large majority of the overlopers from North Korea are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make it easier than in the severely secured demilitarised zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreans.
China considers the overlaids rather than illegal immigrants as refugees and often turns them out with violence.
The relations between North and South, which still formally are able to war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which was particularly spoken of the declined negotiations on deucclarisation.
This meeting took place after the historical meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, in which they agreed in large order to work on the nuclear dismantling of the Korean island.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of the lack of progress in abolition of the US penalties since then.
'Unless faith in trade in the United States also lacks confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral dearmament,' said Mr Ri during a talk for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Delegates, Nancy Pelosi, referred to as the candidate judge of the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him inappropriate to serve at the High Court of Justice
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman would behave like this, she would be called "hysterical"," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senates Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very embarrassed; at times he shouted almost and was especially distracted when he told about his family and his middle school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were evil that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi declared that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
'I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats', says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to put an impediment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would receive the majority in the Delegated House.
"I can say this about it; if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judged at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shortened D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for payable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh addressed questions concerning the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be joyful when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a righteous tirade of months and years of cultivated anger that survives, and she can only cry to get it out of it.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't like that, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere leader and who told her that she was going to cry when she became angry. She developed a method, where she grew when she was angry. To the one she was talking to, she said, "You maybe think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried on.
I just liked that brilliant."
Tears are partly allowed as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially unconscious.
One of my best remaining memories from a former job, in a office dominated by men, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was incredibly angry. An elderly woman, a dead business leader who everyone was a little afraid of, caught me in my necklace and swallowed me into a staircase.
"Don't show them that you're crying," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they've got you on the castle.
Patricia Schroeder, then member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart at his candidate time for the Presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was engaged in an outerly business on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catch damage' or 'apenstreken') and withdraw from the race, the deep disappointed Mrs Schroeder meant that there was no reason why they would not apply for themselves.
"It wasn't a good decision," she told me smiling 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund acquisition, and so she promised not to take part if she couldn't spend $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give to men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she kept her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her - of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of Members, and of anger about sexism - that she put in it.
"There will have been thought that I had a nervous zinc," Mrs Schroeder reminded me of how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave stone?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can benefit from Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were excessive, and although the battle has not been struggled for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be favourable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, earlier this year gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for EUR 200 billion (150 billion) to goods; half of all goods coming from China the US.
Beijing has taken in naturala repairs every time, most recent by raising rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion on US goods.
China has promised to compare the U.S. every time, and the world's on a second largest economy will probably not flirt with the eyes.
In order to allow Washington to bow, requests must be accepted, but public bowling for the US is too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smartly, the trade war with the US, China, could support positively in a longer term, as the mutual dependency of the two economies is decreasing.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which would allow one of the two countries to get into an economic free fall, is indeed far more dangerous than observers previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research colleague of the Centre for a New American Security, a thought tank specialized in national security issues which address Asia.
Syria 'Clear' to return refugees, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the circumstances in his country are improved.
'Today the situation at the site is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism', he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the spot.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are some six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to restore the ruined country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional aid or aid from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six successive times on European soil and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn reached the number of 14,5 points needed to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was fighting almost all the tournament, left his long battle from the tea into the water at par 3, hole 16, and granted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, glorified in all its rounds and became one of the four players who ever picked up5-0-0 since the tournament started in his current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classed player on the world list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not crying so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy we've got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fake to his countrymate, John Ram, who went down the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes and 1 hole swallowed in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I've defeated Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winners of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. officer, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've struggled.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We bought opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very good.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud I can be their leader.
You need to take your hat to the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations take off in the provinces Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
