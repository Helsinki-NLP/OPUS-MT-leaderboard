Biden conducts investigations in three key countries
In only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a prominent Democrata, is a preliminary part of three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured by 51%, compared to 46%, following the president.
In Arizona, the status is 49%–45% of Biden in the wild and in Michigan leads to the superior victory of Biden, as it leads at 12 degrees, 52%–40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these countries, and actually more.
Trump is sitting in this day with a crown - virus age that nationals are teaching him more and more, saying that the majority of the sought nations have responded badly, or very bad at the beginning of the pestilence.
In addition, Trump has come badly out of protests and disadvantages that emerged at George Floyd’s death.
Trump and his government have been bad or wrong with these matters.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism because he has ordered the FBI to break back protests in cities where city or government managers are Democrats.
Has it created a huge ulphur among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger has been infected to other Americans.
In addition, pictures of federal police to climb Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States’ matter.
Watched the advertisement The Lincoln Project exactly attention to this, but it can be seen below.
Trump triumphed all three countries in 2016, but with very little voting differences.
Trump triumphed very many countries with a small difference of votes and overcome the elections with minor votes.
For example, Michigan triumphed with only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
The same conclusion is to be shown by the political rapporteurs, Biden is taken forward.
A new study of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s forehead has now been produced from the scary limits of the investigation.
The same is the CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who looks well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the conclusions of the questions, is that Trump may have the hope to reconcile important positions in the country of flexibility if the attention of the electoral struggle focuses on the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy impact following the Covid-19 phenomenon, but the voters do not appear to be associated with the economic attack with the crown virus age.
In fact, a large majority of the voters seem to have blamed Trump for a disadvantaged response to the crown virus age, but trust him better to deal with the economic attack that the country is working for this time.
However, Trump has failed to control the discussion in the electoral struggle.
Following the injuries that have been flamming almost continuously from the news, the video was unhappy because four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion to the law and importance of it.
Law and Order, became his signs.
Now it seems to have failed definitely, as said earlier.
As the views of Trump are more likely, more and more Repeople tell Trump to leave and describe support for various Bidens, or someone else that is then Biden without name in particular.
This is because of the arrangement in the United States to choose in many choices on the same code.
Thus, the choice can simply be marked with the other class in the presidential section of the electoral code, and it can only be valid as voting for all its other suppliers on the voting code.
Thus, prosecutors of the Repubic group in other offices are tempting to disappear Trump and to achieve independent success in the elections.
Adolescent Olympic Games in Dakar departed until 2026
The teenage Olympics were to be carried out in Dakar in the next year, which has now been suspended until 2026 because of the crown virus age after the International Olympics Committee and Senegal reached an agreement.
However, the explosion of the first Olympic Games in Africa is a shock for many young sporters.
A volunteer arrested for the burning in Nantes
A volunteer in the judiciary of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
Le Monde claims that the suspect, refugee from Rwanda, who served as overseer in the church, recognized the fire.
The man’s lawyer speaks to another media that the man will look greatly after his actions.
One of the things that were destroyed in the fire was an angel from the 17th century and the historical picturesque windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who was not named, was arrested shortly after the 18th July, but was so released.

"No way out of this"
I am welcomed at Baltasar’s and the Christ’s Sea of Samper in Copavogi.
My visit is a new video show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st in the Labour of Little Kambi on Snowfellsnesi.
This is the first time that the father shows together.
I'm brought down to Baltasar's office, where great paintings appear with me.
Large and dramatic pictures of males in the past, but also of flying creatures; an arc on one, shades birds on one.
From the workroom, it's out to the home.
“ We were with a horse here with us who wear the grass, ” Baltasar tells me.
“ The harvest works much better than a sleeve on this hole and hills we have. ”
Mireya is with us the Christian Sea and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works are undergoing the works here.
“Instructions, mixtures of paperworks and sculpture.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, where I'm working with the light and like that," she says.
“ It’s been a year since that idea came up.
Then there were some jobs I was working on, and I would have wanted to show there, but they were trapped in Tokyo from Covid.
When Dad began painting, and I saw where he was going, I recognised my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar’s work has a strong baptism in the Icelandic history of women’s chores and watchs.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the guys, I was elected to make a piece that is related to them, ” says Mireya, but she works with the Victory No Bjarna Son of gold in the Sign store.
"That's how I'm doing the installation from the shirt."
In the last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy of Sensation at Snowfellsnesi, including in the Little Kambi Hole, and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old loader that has recently been made up, ” says Mireya, who talked to the Baldvian Sverris, an artist who found out that Mireya and Baltasar were putting a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938, and at the Arts School in Barcelona, before he went to a world trip to study artistic collections and study studies.
He arrived in 1961 in Iceland and was filled with land and nation.
Here he came back shortly, met with his wife, Christius, and has lived here for 57 years since 1963.
Balthasar is a prominent artist, who has held thousands of private visions, and shows with the Christian Sea in many parts.
It is the most known for its large wall figures, named wall decoration in the Plateykirche and fracture in the Vice - State Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitter thing I am having and nowhere else, ” says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows that are stretched and stretched.
As soon as I came here, I thought, "Wow, here you can work."
Mireya is the oldest Christian and Baltasars children, born in 1964.
“ I knew, it was quite clean, that I was not supposed to be a picturesque woman, ” she asked if she wanted to walk in her parents ’ footsteps.
“When I went to a spatial and natural school course, I did everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized I was on the flight.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
Like her father, she has shown many things around the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All Balthasar’s and the Christ’s sons have fetched the way of art.
“ I call this virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Icelandair counts have been in a grey area when airlines were cancelled
Icelandair believes that the company has been in a grey area when the company has cancelled all airlines in the middle of a core.
Then he says that laws that meant a shuttleman to go into the apartment will be taken for an inspection after the burn at the Brothers City Station.
On July 17, Icelandair urged to cancel all the 38 pilots who worked with the company while the core deal with the airline was still on the table of a State Contractor.
The shared view was whether Icelandair had been able to take this pronunciation and was prepared to resolve the matter before the Court of Justice.
Yet, after the statements, Icelandair and Icelandair never ended.
However, in his mind, The Onear Dadason Social Minister says that Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right payman.
“ My view is that this is a certain right to defend wages.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in the room of a saddler, it's not an option to go this way.
It is clear in my mind that this wouldn't have happened.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into the gray area where this touched," says Ásmunnda.
He will not so speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“It is also dangerous to discuss now that it is only normal to go up this system to reduce this right, and that is why I am completely opposed. ”
In the morning, at the end of June, Assmunt was asked about the reaction of governments to the bridge on a brother’s city trip, where three were killed.
The council now says that the study is on the table of the House and the Human Institution, to which he directed.
“ Today’s laws do not allow the shuttle to enter the apartment.
I have asked the House's and Human Rights Agency to examine, in particular, whether there is a reason for making some legislative changes.
I'm ready to make the legislative changes that need to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Ásmunt Einar.

USA said to increase pressure on worker Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The United States Government has made further efforts to force European companies to dismiss the North Stream 2 gas management project, which is led by Russia, according to the World on Sunday, which quotes to people who are aware of the matter.
According to the newspaper, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Energy Ministry have contacted European workers to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the firms in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that the Americans had in a “friendly ” tone emphasised that the United States wanted to prevent the reality of North Stream 2.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one thirst to the German media.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo, U.S. foreign minister, last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best to “come out now” or risk punishments under 232 of the general law Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian orchestra Gazprom, supervising the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell, plus Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the last mentioned company said that the efforts of the United States to undermine “reasonable infrastructure ” would be a clear interference in the European United States.
In the past of the week, the United States Representative Parliament approved a change in the laws on land protection aimed at extending the US penalties against companies involved in the establishment of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas route.
According to one of the legal operators, the information may be directed to companies paying or providing ships, insurance, dispatching or connecting services for such ships, in addition to those offering a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European firms and officials have repeatedly declared their disappointment in the United States' attempts to divide from European energy issues by applying penalties against North Stream 2, and some of them have even called after Brussels winners of data operations.
Moscow consultants have also hardly criticized Washington’s action and called it unfair competition.
Previously on the week, President Dmitrij Peskov, spokesman said that Russia would bring up a new plan on how the project will be completed if the officers in Washington keep the new penalties to stress.
Prepare for further transport of official establishments to land
Social and childcare ministers are planning to carry out more public organisations to the next country.
The Brunavar area of the House's and Human Rights Agency will be transferred north to Saudárk in autumn to the Council's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to be transported to the north.
Oneer Dadason, a social and childcare minister, said in the bomber of the wave this morning that it would be important for the population to be transferred to public organizations.
Thus, a great creation of valuables also generates diversity.
“ It is socially important, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Employment, currency-creating structure, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some natural exploitation and these types of jobs that are officially supported by the construction, says Ásmunt.
“Creates increasing diversity, creates better support for this resource use and the creation of the nation. ”
The decision to move the Hospital and Human Nuclear Facility has been severely criticised by its employees and the National Association of Disabilities and Healthcare Transporters.
Six people who have expertise in burning matters and work in the department are all resident in the capital area, and none of them intend to move farms to the Saddle Crowk.
“ I think it is quite clear that political views are a sharing of how hard it should be.
My view is, and has always been, that we should take action to improve the distribution of public jobs," says Ásmunnd.
“ We see that our neighbouring nations, Normen, and Danir have done this well. ”
He is convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see more spread in public bodies around the country.
“I think it's necessary to take further political decisions on the transport of official services to the country, as I was doing with the House and the Human Institution.”
He illustrates the transport of a Food Agency to Selfoss, Icelandic Landmarks to Akraness and Unemployment Guarantee to the Skaga strand.
“ Today’s workplace on the Skaga strand is important for this society.
I think we should take further steps in this creature."
“ I am preparing further steps in this world.
More transportation."

Gottlieb warns that the unreasonable spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in autumn
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former CEO of the United States Food and Medicine Surveillance, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult ” for school examples to open in a new year of study if the crown virus spreads without delay within these communities.
“ I think school authorities need to examine how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus is distributed unavoided in society, it will be very difficult to open in that condition, ” Gottlieb said in “Face the Nation. ”
Since the autumn is to begin in the next weeks, the government of Trump encouraged school authorities to open their schools for students and to offer education at school five days a week.
However, these trials of President Trump and Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus age would probably “were worse before he improves ” and confirmed that school examples at the most difficult locations could have to postpone school opening for a few weeks.
Yet, on Thursday, the sickness defence centers gave guidance on how safest to open school for students.
The instructions include following the distance between people of loyalty, students and employees in schools, the use of facial defences and the division of students into limited groups to reduce infection pathways.
However, the sickness defence centres did not issue the school managers’ recommendations on when to close schools if crown virus meals are increasing, as Gottlieb says has been “inconceivable. ”
“ When this uncertainty situation is rich and accurate instruction has not been given on how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“That is why I think it is very important to get accurate information about what standards are precisely, as the disease defense centres did not give in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb said that school examples must consider the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread, and testing capabilities when decisions are made on whether to keep schools open or switch the alpha to learning on the network.
If between 5% and 10% of the analysis gives a positive conclusion, “the issue is to be troubled” but more than 10% is “the threshold when carefully considering whether to close the school assessments.”
“ This is an indication that the pestilence has been established in society, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make the parts of the world of Florida, which is the pregnancy of the American Crown Virus age, difficult to open for teaching in schools for the next month.
Coronal virus meats have increased to more than 30 countries, and Cholumbia’s districts than the pregnancy of the patriarch is located in the solar belt called the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, though, said that there was evidence that the increase in some countries, including Arizona and Texas, had begun to slow down.
Yet, despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that there was a “different sign” of slowing on the patrol in some countries in the sunbelt, it is going to“ hot in the coals ” in others, including Southern Caroline, Alabama, Indian and Illinois.
Many government managers have set rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped decisive reopening to track the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing baths, limiting the number of people at restaurants, closing film houses, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on mask use to overcome the patrol, which are actions that enable countries to avoid resuming the strict limitations set at the beginning of the march.
Besides the use of masks by various countries, various companies have required people to use face defense.
The McDonald's faster is the latest company to make use of the facial defences and therefore add to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on mask use.
Gottlieb said that he expected that more companies would take up a mask family, especially where the danger is considerable.
“If we can really control the petrol when the winter goes through until we get vaccines or any kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something we can all do, but that does not directly change our life and allows us to keep what is very important for us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school, ” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not wish to make mask use in the whole country, he encouraged the United States last week to use face defense, saying at the White House’s news conference that “they have an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, “It’s a time to expect”
The Crystal Palace attached to the summer when Roy Hodgson, CEO of the company, declared that the visitor, a professionary of Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
The Philistine has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems to be on the way, but he has previously been addressed to a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether the team in that quality class is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially in the financial uncertainty periods of sport this summer, after a period where Zaha shortened four limits and made five support for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
At an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the period, Hodgson said that “the news would be expected” about the possible exit of Zaha after confirming that the visitor had“ made it clear ” that he would see his future other than the company.
There are still three years remaining by the visitor’s contract with Palace, and last year, the company indicated that 100 million sterling ponds would be needed for the companion to take it off.
Lin Hodgson ended the period with seven pairs in a row and a double on the last day of the period, which resulted in the fall of the team to the 14th seat.
Zaha found the net mosquitoes only once from the middle of December to the end of the period with a long - term loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to release the company, but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed a missionary in January, which seems to increase the chances of getting the company left, and in the next weeks it will be without doubt in his priorities to ensure social change.
Zaha is the player who played the most minutes in the English electoral department for Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under 28 years that played 1100 minutes or more, which shows how much reconstruction of the team might be necessary to attack with the funds available for the player.

The weather news people have foretold “through flows ” in southern Texas after Hanna’s bulbs reached two times to land, resulting in high rains and wind forces up to 40 feet [40 m] per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as the first stage of a storm (the bottom of a five-step scale) and he has now been moved down into a hot storm, but rain could still score 150 to 300 mm on Sunday, and winds could reach 26 metres in seconds.

Last weeks, Texas has suffered a great increase in crown virus meats.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a calamity notice for 23 districts on the road of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All disguises are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even more difficult, as the bulb goes through areas that have become the worst outdoors due to COVID-19," said Greg.
The Fellibyl first arrived at the country at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christ.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern part of Kennedy County.
More than 43.700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were free of electricity on Saturday evening.

President Donald Trump today said that the government was watching Hanna and Douglas, a arbitrary to Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the beach of Corpus Christ, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety she felt for the world’s age.
This 67 - year - old woman had been at home for health problems related to chronic lung disease.
She said: “This is almost as a double shock for us.
I think many have become poor.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong, and they're standing together."
Heaven on a blossoming sailing in Southern
In some parts of the weather, the weather has been unusually good for farmers.
Most are finished with the first sleeve, another sleeve is largely started, and then it is expected that somebody reaches the third sleeve at the end of summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers like other residents of the country in summer and does not corrupt the spread on the towns of farmers.
Thus, hearing has been good.

News of Harry England’s Princess: A friend of the Duchess of Sussex objects to claims in a new book that has been between the teeth on people
Stott, in a conversation with Sky News, said that the content of the book on prince Harry and Meghan Markle was in no different material of the slide magazines, the only difference was that the book was integrated.
The former soldier wants seas to be increasingly direct to the positive things that their couple have done, such as their kindness.
Stott said: “I feel that what appears therein is no different from what we read in the leaflets, except now only in an integrated book. ”
“ There is a historian that tells us, yet there is no certain that this is from them. ”
“I feel this only one more attack on them, just like the snatching newspapers that persecution them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the field light and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish it would be more discussed about all the good things they have done and their good work, rather than their personal matters. ”
“ Of course, they never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duchess and the Duchess of Sussex shaded the other members of the king’s family, according to a specialist in the history of the king’s family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the king’s family had not been able to use the stars of Prince and Meghan Markle.
She added that the rulership within the king’s family was established, but that it was not possible to control the importance of public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did to support the Queen had a tendency to shade the other members of the king’s family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
“They are very popular.”
“ They had less wedding than most of the sisters in the same position, Andrew had a gigantic wedding, Anne also had a gigantic wedding. ”
“ However, although Harry and Meghan were smaller than Vilhelm and Kathrina’s weddings, there was even much news transfer because of the world’s great interest in the pair. ”
Donald Trump admits he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often sees his records on Twitter that are under war.
During the interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his uncertain repayments on Twitter items — which some each have contained material from the white raceism — brought him into the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he saw his records, Trump answered: “Oft, too often.
So in ancient days, before this came, you wrote letters and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am not sending this, isn't it?
But we won't do it with Twitter.
We'll send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you're going to get a phone call — “Do you really say this?”
I say, “What's wrong with this?" and you'll find various things. ”
Last month, Trump caused a great anger after rejoicing an entry (part from other accounts) with a video of his supporting people in the Villages region of Florida, where an aged couple called “White Power” or“ the Power of the Whites”.
And in 2017, Trump rejoiced three entries against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the Britain First Rights Championship.
The President said Portnoy that the reproductions that would have brought him into the most trouble.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmets, which is small and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve learned that it’s almost always the recompensations that come into trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation for himself, voice of his opposers, and conspiracy doctrines with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television programs and newspapers, which he says is transsured by false truths.
But the President’s own lies have often been ratified under his small sight, and now Twitter means Trump’s entries as a misleader.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries work to develop other location techniques than the GPS system.
The engineer says that the reason could be to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewed in lifetimes.
The GPS technology will follow us every footage.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, at landmarks, in industry and free hours.
Most people think that it is a military agent in the possession of the U.S. Army, which opened it first for general use in the 1930 ’ s.
The GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite to 20,000 miles [20,000 km] height above the earth, and therefore, conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to interfere with it.
And evil people can easily interfere with the reception of these brands," says Samen E. Torsteinsson, a professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and a expert on risk management and security issues.
He also says that he is easy to send errors with a wrong location, for example in war.
“The GPS system is owned by the US Defense Ministry.
They have assured the public that the system is available at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of the very special president to let such things do, then he could expect to do it," says Sigon.
Thus, many countries have become aware of other systems and location techniques.
The Russian and the Chinese both operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is exploding the Galileo position system.
“ The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have greater precision and is naturally under the European Union’s control.
Then there are not only governments who rule it entirely, but many," says Severity.
But many are also watching back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s and until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran marks are sent on very long waves from sent down to the earth.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, men are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a reserve, because it is some other laws to interfere with it, it is much harder than interfering with satellite systems, ” says Sigund.
However, it is likely to be safest to have access to most location systems.
The experienced servant Vern Buchanan died by the Crown Virus
“ Gary was a professional in the golden finger and a faithful servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many, and he was loved and delighted by those who knew him.
I will never forget how exciting he was, the sense of humility, and the loveful joy that he received from helping others."
Bookan’s office published a statement earlier in the month, where Tibbett’s had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbett, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan from 2011.
From the beginning of the world’s age, which is more than 411.200 in New York, has a report of 414.511 cases reported, according to the authorities of the state of health.
According to the state’s health authorities, hospitalisation has increased by 79% from the United States’ National Day, July 4th.
The data also show that at least 50 stations in Florida, on Saturday, they reached the duration.
“ We were told that this could affect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and reconciliation could have a reverse effect. ”
Flight from Hornfird to Cape Town
A turkish dove, a roaster, a ring due, a spine, a glitch, and the crying are among the birds that have come to the country in summer.
On the web of the bird’s bird’s bird’s bird’s bird’s observance stations, nearly every day, you can see short news about the tractors, where they have been seen, and sometimes their generations.
They are many bird viewers in Iceland.
To this end, you can mention the number of people like the Facebook pages of the Italian species of birds.
The group’s members are about 14.600.
There are pictures of birds, and it is obvious that Iceland is dominated by good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
The brine's son of Brynjólf is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is an employee of the fugitive centre of Southeastern and the Southeastern Natural Hall, and carefully monitors the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that make the world rich in Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of robbery or a small sparrow.
The postal center was established in 2005 on the birthday of the Halfdán Björnsson of the Kvikkers in Scientists, with the aim of maintaining the air and continuing the significant natural studies he carried out from 1940.
“ At the age of thirteen, he began to wear information about birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the Kernel.
“ We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly the same as Halfdán did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
Half of them were a farmer and an alien scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and birds.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost nine years old.
Half - ten and his sisters in the cherries were interested in many people who were familiar with them in the Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gisli Arnarson, the “careman” of the Fuglet Surveillance Station.
A bear grew up in the Reyniväls of the Southern Federation, and he suffered abundant natural crops from his neighbor, Half - Daily of the cherries.
But what is it now that the Polish Station in Southeastern Germany is doing?
About March 20, each year, the Fuglat Observatory sets up a special bird annet in the Unarsense, a wooden dose within the Hornfird Cap.
There are standard meanings for the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the shipping time begins.
The nets are up every day, at least from six o'clock in the morning and until noon.
And they need to visit every hour.
The birds that come into them are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a newspaper asks in an audience.
“ Yes, we share this with us, I and Boussi.
Since we need to work for us now, this can be a great pussy game, but somehow we can do this," says Brynjulf.
The networks are then restored from the period from August 1 to November 10 — every day the weather permits.
Between the networks and during the periods they are not upside down, Björn and Bjørn are marking crowns, clouds, and various mosquitos where they reach them.
In addition, they take some special tasks.
One of these tasks is worked in cooperation with the Icelandic Natural Science Agency and is about to gather forest miles of birds.
“ The forest microscope runs on their birds at their winter stations and then moves them to the land of the spring.
This happens shortly before they start, and so these miles are not large when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps out of the bird and trys to find another house when he needs it."
But enough for myths.
Asked about how the birds in Southeastland have this summer told Brynjulf that the warp of the crown seems to be good — where it is over the head.
“ Most of the warp here is at Hala, Southern Germany, and there is a great deal of work.
But there is nothing more to find at the Jökulsarlon, where there was a huge castle a few years ago."
He says that a few years ago, there were more than a thousand crowns, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“When we look at mobs and navys, I feel that it has decreased the last few years what you feel about them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
According to Brunjólf, what can explain the great change is most likely about the supply of food.
"This is all about food."
In that case, humans can also have their work to say about the descendants of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to have enjoyed a great deal in the southeastern country this summer.
“ One of the positive things that I think is cooking is to grow again after great humiliation, ” says Brynjulf, “but during the last decades, the clouds have slowed down enormously. ”
Of spray birds, it is to hear that the marijuana seems to walk well in its sheep in summer like before.
Forests and dufts had decreased a little, but Brunjulf says that it was not to appear until autumn how this summer had proved to them.
But let's turn to the interferences.
They often raise great attention, especially if they are very faint and even colorful.
These two interesting factors are one of the most popular factors of summer: the Rosar Star.
“ Others have been relatively calm in summers in the interferences, ” says Brynjulf, but says that in the country there is now a crystal, and then the calling doves have been seen and have become worsening here.
When the brows and the bears come in clear with the floods, they also mark them, just as other birds.
Significants are international, and they are worldwide.
Differently, the meanings, for example, are the winter stations of the birds, where they are worsening, and which route they are.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, for example, to form a bird’s cultivation.
“ Knowledge has always been increasing. ”
If someone out of the world finds a bird marked by the Southeastern Surveillance Station, the information will be sent to the Icelandic Natural Science Agency.
“We have been recovered from Capital City of South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One of us later found a crown in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjulf, especially the mind, and it is the jungle.
“ The bird is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the fugitive center and the Natural Institute of the Southe have the task of watching his descendants — which has become very sick, and now he has come to the vacuum.
It is difficult to claim what caused a fall in the building, but one doctrine is that the cloud has made a maritime catch that was previously swept by fishing boats and in the sea to good, but that it has now become much better used and affects the forests.
Are you in the best place in the land to watch birds?
“ Of course, you don’t let me say no, ” says Brynjulf laughing, adding: “When we are now chasing with fugitives, we must probably go far away. ”
Surely, the southeastern country is special when bird lives.
“ This area is like a dragged into the country from Europe, but then the birds are dispersed from here.
Being here to look at birds and fugitives is very interesting, but here is less to find birds than elsewhere in the country.
It is not far from a fertile, and to a fool, so that the area that such is suitable for the inspection of birds."
What about Brynjulf's favorite bird?
He thinks about a short time before he answers.
I think the question is difficult.
“ My beauty is my bird, and I have found nine of the ten who have seen the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I think one of the most funny pictures of crystals now.
It is always nice to find birds that have not been seen in this country or are rare, so I am not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But both of them have done so.
If you want to monitor the work of Binna and Bøssa at the Fuglat Survey Center, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the birds.is web.
Sadi-Arabia – The Sunshore of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The travel industry has grown hugely around the world in recent years, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want to have their cookie cut off.
It is thought to destroy governments of about 60,000 billion Icelandic crowns to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian explains this.
But this paradise of travelers will not be in the style that Icelandic countries should be used in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be offered, and women will not be allowed to swallow themselves in bikinia.
How, then, should travelers be attracted to this strictly believed Islamic country?
For example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (such as made by humans), drun - leagues, and robots serve people.
The Guardian says that it's Mohammed bin Salman, the Prince of Sadi Arabia, who wants to invest in this investment.
The money will, of course, be searched in the country’s oiled land.
The Prince of Crown says that there is no discussion that women can release to hide shoulders and knees in public places, but as soon as it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country, because it is too hot where the sun is high and cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
But then you can wonder if it does not also distract the interest of expecting tourists if they cannot buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, who was previously stolen by the presidency of the Central African Republic, announced a presidency procurement
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been chaired, announced that he would offer himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations, he would take criminal action and that his arrest order was issued for his misunderstanding crimes against mankind.
He announced his proclamation in a talk before a large group of supporters in his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old U.S. Army chief and soldier was elected in 2013 in the rebellion of the United Nations to the largest Muslim rebels from the north who poured the nation, mostly to Christian, into the persecuted civil war and serious and long - lasting race.
“The country needs a person with experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech that was critical of the current president's office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first began to be elected after the elimination in 2003 and took up a presidential office for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government was seeking to arrest him for meant crime against mankind and for encouraging national murder, but he has not been arrested since he returned from the exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or other penalties affect his procurement.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to execute the penalties imposed in 2014 for the support of armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera is today governing the country with the support of the United Nations' extensive peacecare, which counts more than 13,000 soldiers and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for another period of time, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups, usually claiming to protect the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crimes have decreased, but still occur bloody events that are usually due to conflicts of resources, but the majority of this demant - rich country are not under the government’s powers.
The violence has taken over 1.5 million people to escape their homes.
The status of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is “inadmissible for everyone”, says Toni Kros
The position of Gareth Bale at the Spanish team, Toni Kros, central Madrid, says, is “inconsistent for everyone. ”
Bale didn't participate in any of the last seven games of the team, and he took a little part in the LaLiga-joy Los Blancos, and now in summer it's come up the patting position that the player intends to keep still before and let his contract run out, but the company hopes he's going on a path.
“ There is no way to avoid being inappropriate for everyone, ” said Kros in Lauschan attack endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little mad about it.
When he was asked whether the circumstances had been negative in the atmosphere of Real, Kros said: “Not as much as it was expected.
I've known him for six years and we've worked some important things together."
Chinese are giving Reykjanesbath 2,000 facial masks to support the fight against the crown virus
Senior Chinese, Jin Zhijian, delivered the city leader of Reykjan's town two thousand face masks last week.
The point was the visit of the city manager to the Chinese council of 22 July last year.
For the first time, news was reported.
The request of the city manager’s visit was to reimburse the visit of the Chinese Messenger in Reykjanes’ town, where he visited the council and met with the city manager.
Whisky news reports that there was discussed about encouraging friendship between the town of Reykjans and Xianyang, whereas the municipalities started their collaboration between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, should be based on this friendship, but the city authorities of Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the crown virus age.
In a newsletter, the masks will be used in sensitive agencies and offices of Reykja’s towns for both employees and other guests coming there.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and of the People’s Republic of China, the inscription of the face mask box says: “Everyone is behind, except his brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculate lowering in wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Icelandic Master KR, for the next month, saying that he is interested in the Danish first department.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland Champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old visitor claims to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jacob’s daughter.
The Danish agreement with KR applies to the end of this playtime, so it is clear that a Danish company would need to negotiate with KR on a purchase price to get it in August before a new playtime begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would wait until winter by coming to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish departments start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I need to break my agreement with KR-inga, but I have told them I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to Bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with the Russian Christn Son trainer, who would have shown his full understanding, and Thomsen said not to believe that the price would be a great problem.
“ I have also had a conversation with two 1st branches after that department was finished, and then I knew where they would end.
There has already been a little interest in the coming period, so it may be good that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic department stops," said Thomsen, but it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy his contract with KR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been interesting.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend who is from Iceland and come with me.
This is about some things," said Thomsen, and he said to look first to the Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-inga doesn't need to worry about his being not all in practice and games, though he missed Denmark.
“ KR know what it gets from me, and that is that I do things 100 percent.
I can completely look beyond because I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says that he's going to lower in the wages to leave the Icelandian masters in the next department of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably need to reduce only the wages, from the crown - virus crises that seemed to have driven the Danish companions just more than those of Icelandic.
But I’m also studying, and one solution may be that a companion made me a job.
Most of the members of the 1st section have an agreement with supporters.
I'm learning sports management through the player organizations and finishing the bachelor grade," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the initial KR in two games in the Pepsi Max department in this playtime, but get a story in five games and score one goal.
He started 21 games for the team in the past and scored seven boundaries.
KR is the same choice at the top of the Pepsi Max department and in the game for good, but the team meets KA at Akureyri today.
Crown virus on board in a carriage when a car manager arrives in a hot rifle of face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers on board in a Arriva street car in Liverpool for mask use.
The chief of the car hears explain to a woman that it is not in his work ring to tell passengers to use a mask.
The chief said: “It is not in my work ring to tell everyone who goes up in the car to use a mask. ”
A Witness said this about the incident: “A man and an older woman began to give her the word, and a lot of war broke out. ”
“ The chief had to go out of his seat and came to ask what was actually going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask right. ”
“ The woman then robbed out of the wagon and said that he was going to report the incident. ”
A speaker of Arriva said: “The security of our businesses and our employees is as a priority with us.
“Our business is, like, obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply).”
“Describes instructions and meanings for customers on this, and all other distance rules are on-board in stations, on social media and on our websites.”
A mask family has been in force in public transport since 15 June.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been seen worldwide.
More than 650.000 have died.
Over 9,900,000 people have seen the world’s crown virus.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disabilities more often
The game woman is involved in a new effort to increase the involvement of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The effort is underway at the same time as 30 years, since the United States law on the rights of people with disabilities, which appear on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of seeing themselves and their life reflected in reality on the screen.
“ Nothing can happen to replace personal experience and real display pictures, ” she says.
“This is why it is so important to consult appropriate actors in an appropriate role.”
Spencer discussed the effect she had of seeing hard - dark people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times ” factor.
The marks shown at the CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they rude the way as the first elements of two parents of both African origins.
Aggression against hunger pushes Yoho to side after events in the assembly
WASHINGTON (AP) – regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger on Saturday, they said that they had asked the senator Ted Yoho to tell himself from the control of the associations, and that he had come to it, after what they called "attack" on the senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Sergeant Democrata, in New York, accused Yoho, the senator of the Repophies in Florida, of using a low-court and male arrogance when he deceived her when they met on the steps of the congress house last Monday.
Yoho argued that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who was witnessing the incident confirmed that the word was as she described it.
Bread for the World declared that the government of the associations had met Yoho on Friday and sought that he would “justify our commitment to standing with women and dark people, domestic and worldwise, which lead us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World web site, their “co - Christian voice ” pressed the assembly and government to end the hunger in the country and in the world.
“ Where Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hungry and poverty by trusted public policies, the organization keeps on the air the respect, honour, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we are dealing with people in power, wherever it is in the political litro, ” states the statement.
“ Our appreciation reflects recent activities and the words of the MEP Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements made for our government members. ”
When the news was processed, Joho’s speaker had not answered an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech at the sitting last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said dramatically about the event and pointed out her words against what she called a male remembrance that “conceives violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than twenty of her colleagues underlined her words that the incident was an example of man’s too common behavior.
Yoho described the event as a short discussion on policy matters, and “no one had been annoyed, inclined or attacked. ”
He said that he had “convenient attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in its first period as a prominent senator and has received both praise and burden for her cleansing.
Yoho, the 65 - year - old, is one of the most persistent senators of the assembly and will sit in a sacred stone at the end of his fourth season.
Wait until 98 minutes in the locale by cutting the first target of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or put up in the English electoral department during this playtime until he cut against Leicester today in a 98th minute in the final round of the department.
Lingard hadn't cut in the English department since he cut two times against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as a refugee today for Manchester United when Leicester was in a final game on a Master’s District.
When more than seven minutes had passed over a normal playtime, Lingard shed the ball of Kasper Schmeichel targetman Leicester and scored the empty target.
Jesse Lingard's long-term target.
Real Madrid Players Dispensed with Police Rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, the Master’s Department of Europe, without having to go to two weeks of suspicion.
British governments have decided that travelers from Spain need to go on two weeks of suspicion, to stop the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of competitors at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Council says that the individuals who are unequivocal to the rules will only be in delimited areas, before a odour door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
The Madridians can therefore meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2 to 1 down in the endeavour after losing at Santiago Bernabea on February 26th.
The victory will continue in the 8-large view that will be made in Portugal.
Decaying and defeating the Land of the Trade Sheol
The news of superfluous hotels and tents to judge, in the least southern, is clear that the Icelandians have been able to travel within the country this summer.
If those who have landed under foot have been lucky at the end of the weather and weather donors DV in one matter of the fact that the summer was just said beautifully, at least here.
But now there is a commercial sanctuary that has been the largest traveler in the year.
However, it is uncertain how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, now it is true that events that have led a large number of people to not be held during the normal year.
It is enough to mention a national celebration.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but it is now a look for a land - wide explosion, but especially in the south and southwest.
The weather station predicts a rainfall from Thursday evening and at least until Saturday evening.
For example, long - term prophecy is not a sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic, and it is of course possible to make changes.
In his prophecy on his weather web, Blika, the weather scholar, the son of One Sweinbern, says that it is softened to expect the shop heroes.
Says he: A hollow in the hills with a cold that too often reaches down to the surface, results in a warm southwester air attempting to approach only with wind and vomiting.
Surely also warm airs that are "invaded" over the north.
One of the prophecy’s foretellings shows support and says: “A small wave from America hits eastward and with it a summer - sounded air.
When she approaches, she approaches “bloms” in the form of decreasing air pressure and considerable summers.”
The great prophecy, the European Calculator Centre on the left of the map, and the United States GFS prophecy on the right, are quite similar to this development.
The understanding of the humiliation goes over late on Thursday and early on Friday, with a flash of A and a rain in the most of the whole land.
The center of 985 hPa will then be followed.
This time, some warm air in the North and East is followed on Saturday and even Sunday.
Yet, it could be blowed up.
You hurt seriously when the car with cattle falls in Wexford
You were seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Brown in Wexford.
A bovine truck ran on the bridge and attacked a man -less standing car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered serious damage in the accident, which occurred at 13:50 a.m. today.
He was brought to the hospital in Wexford, where he was strongly held.

Following a actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“ I was shot in her like a man gets such a youth shot, ” says Birna Renn Björnsdótter about Marisku Hargitay, the principal woman of the elements Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so the mountains of the actress that she was able to take the factors and wait for her hours together, just to be able to say hello.
When Birna Renn Björnsdog, the owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Office, looked like many Icelandians at the sports factors Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the centuries, she collapses for the main players of Marisku Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actress in the Award Stories Part of Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager, in the age that many begin to develop with her sophisticated love, she did not experience it as her ages, because she was strangered to curse her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boy - sound teams and young magnificent cardiovascular crowns from movies but had no idea.
“ I was cutting out pops and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me to hide that I was a lesbian."
She says sometimes that when people get out of the cabin, they will go through the late gels.
“ We spend our adolescent years in putting down these youths, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that pulled me into her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something with her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her shoes."
It runs on the touch of the actress when she was supported in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in the city, and got Birna and their friend, the son of Gunnar Helga, to help with the recordings.
“ We were working in 30 people and spending a delightful time with strangers.
This is naturally an intimate atmosphere when you spend so long time together a day so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, there is a talk that Birna is a great fan of Mariscan.
One woman in the recording team tells her friend to know the actress because he was in the recording team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and ask her new friend regularly how her friend likes to work with her actress and whether Birna could meet her.
“ She tells me to stop this, she doesn’t know if she can let it happen, ” says Birna.
When the movie is finally finished, the group, and Birna, for the last time, try to convince the woman to try to bring the meeting around.
“ She had got some bottles and said that she would just do this.”
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is happening in the matter.
The woman does not answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she will then wake up with a long - long message.
“ I look at the phone and cry upwards.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up by crying, and I say, I have to go to the shower, and I have to make me fine, and go down into a city."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, players, and the recorder Law and Order were supported on a hotel at Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you will be doing well, ” says the messages, and Birna dresses herself closely, asking at the reception where it takes place and takes the elevator up to the 45th height where the group has gathered.
Birna comes and waits until a woman in the team comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if it can help.
“ I say I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna of Iceland had come. ”
When the friend finally comes, he looks ahead of Birna and asks how she came all the way to the end, he would be strictly secure.
Birna explains that she has just taken the lift and asks for a meeting with Marisku.
“ Yes, I don't know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna's counting.
On her side, there's an extra player in the elements, and they're starting to talk together.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you? ’ says Birna.
“I played this as if this was the most normal thing in the world. ”
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The players appear regularly when a break is made, they get talks, and Birna looks around and looks for Marisku, which is not visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sorry to go.
Birna asked him to put his hands on another employee, and she did not want to go anything immediately.
Amazingly, the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He comes with his other friend and says: ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who definitely wants to see Marisku. ’
Then he'll go.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend will run to Birna.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry.
These are unusual circumstances today, there are journalists with her so she won't stop anything.
She's going the right way to the car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down and find her wheelchair.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look at the right and lose my face" Birna's veins start and take the lift down to the Times Square.
There she finds forty wheelchairs, some marked and some not.
However, Marisku’s bicycle doesn’t find her, and then it becomes desperate.
“ I find the bulb over me because I had spent half a day in this but think so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Ignorance keeps Birna back to the hotel, where she sees the window, watching herself with an awful eyes, realized that Birna failed to accomplish her purpose.
Bears are in favour of fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under a cloud to cover me for the rain.
Then I look at the right and lose my face."
There was no other than Mariska Hargitay in her pants dressed in the factors, and Birna knew a fault — but Birna could hardly move from mental irritation.
“ I look at my body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
Bearna will do it and recalls to pitch in the shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Barna's screaming up.
“ I say I am from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "That's nice to meet you."
The conversation did not get much longer, because Marisku’s car is coming, and it’s flashed on it.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Bears a greeting of the religious god, watching the car drive away and then breaking.
“ I call a cooker in Erling and Gunna, and they thought that this was not possible.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I'm saying, "Yes, I'll meet her, you have to meet me now.
Then we scattered in soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She does not notice anything, though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ This is so once in life, offering such time and energy to make such a happening.
But I'll always be fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen discussed Birna Renn Björnsdog in the Award Stories of Raise 1.
Police does not spread the virus
It is unreasonable to worry that the crown virus can be carried with alcoholisms used by the police.
This is said by a police officer at the traffic department of the police in the capital area in conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have come from people who are worried about the use of the same mouthpiece for all drivers when the police are taking care of, are on a traffic gate and let everyone who has the way to blow.
The police, however, say the most complete cleanliness.
“ It is not really a special mouthpiece, but we are recommending beakes in which people are blowing in, ” says a policeman.
“ Some want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few thousand centuries. ”
Asking if it seems enough distance, then a policeman says it is.
If you try to prove positive, then use the police to another extent.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal abdominal disorders: Among other things, anication can be incorporated to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not random.
Individuals suffering from stomach inflammation, which is a disease characterised by abdominal pain, creams, thembes, windswallows, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to the exacerbation of symptoms in the United States' anxiety and depression organisations (ADAA).
“ This is because the ristle is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the subject does not decrease, food intolerance may be considered.
Judge is trying to stop the decision that children should be released from the immigration authorities
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly gave a foreseen time by saying that the immigrant and customs authorities in the United States do not need to leave children free if it is not possible to do it with any of the three ways described in her previous order.
However, it was also emphasised in its order that immigrants and customs authorities still have the obligation to release their children without need for an unnecessary delay.
The three paths of Gee are to release families held by immigrants and lawyers, to put children in the hands of a man of responsibility, or to release families to a state judgment.
Shalyn Fluharty, chairman of the Agency, Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with a legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of immigrant and customs authorities to decide whether they should continue to have children.
“The main thing I think is that children are kept out of the prison, and they are not released unless immigrant and customs authorities agree or families agree to break up," said Fluharty.
Family is held at three locations of immigrant and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Karnes County in Texas.
The children in these places are aged 1 to 17 by lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
In June, Gee, supervising the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in Conservation, said that, as “the rules on mask use and social distress are not or are not followed,” it would be urgent to move children from these stations.
969 people who are maintained in the immigrant and customs authorities have been identified with the crown virus and have been isolated or monitored from 23 July, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the centers for family preservation.
Over 3700 cases have been confirmed in preservation
Will examine the law on the autonomy of the rulers
The Prime Minister does not unusually say that lifestyle funds set out in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
The comments of the Banking Director on the need to ensure the autonomy of the governments of the credits, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After interviewing the Icelandair Airlines, Icelandair’s airlines and declared all airlines, the Governing Board declared that governments appointed by VR under the management of the Lifeyrissguard of traders or paid vouchers against the participation of the Icelandair Liebling Fund in a expected partial offer.
Ragnar Torr Ingolfsson, president VR, continued to say that if they did not make the recommendations, governments would be replaced.
Ragnar Tor resigned his statement three days later, as well as VR.
Asgeir Jonsson, banking director, said in the news of RUV on Friday, to ensure the independentness of governments in the agreements of the funds and possibly by legislative changes.
Catherine Jacob’s daughter, the Prime Minister, says importantly that the rulers of life - ear treasures are independent, but they are already assured by law.
“Now, of course, the Banking Director, who is conducting the financial supervision that has to do with this, has to say that it is necessary to look at the regulations around this independence, we will, of course, take it into consideration if something needs to go over there,” she says.
Katrin says that laws according to life-eye treasures should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is preferable to discuss the social and moral standards they want to emphasise in their investments.
“ I did not think anything abnormally, as well as that of life - ears, they also set themselves in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I normally believe that such decisions are taken through policy, but not through specific investment decisions," says Katrin.
“ Unhappy traffic pipes at Elfsarru, ” says the president of the City Government of Årburg
The Hollow S. Haraldsson, president of the city of Aarborg, says a traffic ep, which is forming at the Elfsarbröh in Selfossi daily completely impatient.
He hopes that a new bridge over the Elphopsy Sea will come forth in autumn.
Now that Icelandians are traveling around their country, and high traffic in the country’s roads is creating a daily traffic trailer at the Elf - arrival when drivers are on the way to Selfoss or through the town community.
Long lines are forming at the bridge and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yes, it’s totally intolerant, this is one traffic trap here and not only on holidays, because this is just the word in active days too.
There are long prayers, sometimes quite up to the Hellisheed for those who want to get here on their way east of land and those who are coming to the west, so that it makes a way to see that we need a new bridge and not later than yesterday,” says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city government in Arburg.
Hellow says that the city governments in Årburg had recently met with the President of the Road Operation and the design of the Road Operation, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you ever have been optimistic about working in these matters, I think I can say it now, because it is really working in this, and we should be able to see that new bridge is being invited to autumn. ”
But is there any counsel to the drivers who are in the queue of the Elphopsy bridge every day during the summer?
“ Yes, it is possible to go through and through the Eyrarback, but those who are going east of the land, it is not possible to indicate that they are going to the Lyngdal Sea, but those who are going to the armies should use Mosfellsheed, District and Lungal Heather. ”
The Hole S. Haraldsson, President of the City Government of Aarburg, who says the Traffic Couple, who forms insufficient at the Elfsarbrücke at Selfoss.
During the day, long - waited ones are forming at the Elphopsy Bridge, and drivers often have to wait for a considerable time to get over the bridge.
Then the only advice is to breathe deeply and to think something positive.
The future of the homes of the coal bears in the north of Brisbane takes place for the organizational judgment
The city government said that, in addition to the vital home of the coal bears, the sweeps, and the gray gushauks, it would be an important gap between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Commissioners have prompted the rejection of civil governments to the Court of Justice of Organization and the Environment in order to prove that the construction is in accordance with the City Organization Act of 2014, would meet the non-compliant organisational and societal needs and will be “without implications”.
There is a great opposition to these planned implementations in the neighborhood.
The executives argue that, despite the complete compliance with the organization, it could be changed if it did not meet the requirements, rather than rejecting it.
As a result, many steps are carried out, including service station, childcare, and 39 housing houses.
Public transmitters were more than 120 at the conjunction period, and most protested the suggestion that it was too large and inappropriate for the region.
The leader of Brisbane’s city government said that the city needed to buy the land to protect the coal bear.
“ Adrian Schrinner has to stop throwing tax funds to the executives of judgment and buying this country to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane, ” said Cassidy City Officer.
“This is one of the most important homes of the coal beans in the mountain to Mangroves area, and there is a number of coal beans. ”
In the week, Schrinner said that the city government wanted the home of the coal bears in the area to be protected.
“ We didn’t think the report was suitable for the area, ” said Schrinner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously, we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will result in the preservation of homehood. ”
Schrinner said that carding on home coal bears would be the common responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the homes of the coal bears that local authorities support when applying applications for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coachman Man Utd, was hoped to have a championship that the team had secured a third seat in the English selection department today.
It will therefore play in the European Master's Department for the next period.
The United had a steady or victory against Leicester today and was the finding of the Devil’s Red Devils.
“ It is a great deal for the players to reach the third seat, according to how the situation has been during the period.
I think that the bars may have overcome a spiritual hill by working such a great game, since we have lost twice in the preliminary course of this period.
We knew that we needed a decision today, now we can have the next chapter with these boys to work titles," said Solskær winner.
Manchester United is still able to work a title during this period, but the European Department has played in August and is as good as the 8-long term.
Vapnahlé begins at midnight in the East Ukraine War War
Kiev, Ukrainian — the Ukrainian Army and the Eastern Ukrainian Antispyars are now preparing “the complete ” armed battle to begin at midnight, and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives said that they had given their soldiers orders on arms lake and issued orders for a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian Army said that his army had “has been prepared ” for the army battle.
If it is done, it would be “the way for the execution of other decisions” of the Minsk peace agreement, according to the statement of President-in-Office of the Ukrain before the week, where the arms charter was called a time-contemporary crisis.
The aim of the Minsk peace agreement, which was made in 2015 through France and Germany, was to eliminate the conflict between Ukraine and the separation of Russia, which began in 2014 after the introduction of Russia into the Crimean Republic and the support of the country for separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fight.
On Sunday, the Presidents of Russia and the Ukrainians rejoiced both of the armshlete on the phone and emphasised the importance of the agreement reached at the meeting in Paris in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern over the call of Kiev that the Minks meeting should be reviewed and said that the position of Volodimir Selenskij, President of the Ukrainian Republic, on the “inconsistentity of the Minsk Meeting, which he still showed in this telephone, should be reflected in real operations”.
Selenski, however, stressed the need to take the “preferent action” to deliver the Ukrainians who are prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, the embedded Crimean and Russian, according to the statement from the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only be dominated by borders with Russia in the areas of separation when they have received broad self - control and when choices have been held in the regions.
The meeting decreased conflicts, but the Ukrainian army and rebels have continued to shoot.
When the leaders of the Ukrainian Republic, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other interviews, the support of the Minsk Convention was demonstrated and agreed to start the peace process again.
Selenski, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted the Ukrainian borders to be dominated, but the Kreml government demands that the agreement be made without any change.
The new VAT meeting was reached on Wednesday before the three-sided cooperative group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine, plus the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore delighted by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blessing of Peter’s stock, French also mentioned the arms lake, saying that “rebuilding confidence and laying the foundation for the very necessary and long - seeking relationship with the people must be rebuilded. ”

Markasup in the first victory of Blika in July
On June 29th, IA was held in the field, 5 to 3, in the Pepsi Max department of men at the Coopervogsfield tonight.
He's going to lose his third game in a row in the department.
After having won their first three games in the department, Breakfast played five games without joy and had been lost three in order for the game at IA tonight.
It was, therefore, to work or to be killed for Blika, who came in a lot of power into the game.
Alexander the Holy Son of Sigurds led the team with a fine execution in the 11th minute after Christ’s son Steindor had sent him through IA’s defense.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead after the very fine preparation of the Gisla Eyel’s son from the left.
There was no land or beach in the first half of the game where a high - pressured homeman made them difficult to associate shipments.
Blisters had all the powers on the field, and the third goal was shaken in a 36th minute when Danin Thomas Mikkelsen scalped in the corners of the Gunnlaug’s Son’s Holy Holy One.
Then Christ, the son of Steindor, cut his second goal, and the fourth mark of Blika only three minutes later.
However, the history of the first half of the game did not end there.
The last time Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson cut off a vital shot shortly before a play break, Kwame Quee had then broken climbly on Viktori Jonssyni within the team of Blika.
So 4–1 was the stand for Breakfast when the half-game fluid was bile.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half of the game when the Skagamans cut back.
Then the son of Sevar, the son of Jonah, was alone and unauthorized on the market of Blika, and directed the ball easily into the network after the corners of Tryggva the son of Harald.
However, only three minutes later, when he broke to Alexander Helga, there was a sharp break within IA.
The scientists were judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen had no safety to pass Breakfast 5 to 2 when only seven minutes had passed by the second half of the game.
Five minutes after Mickelsen's target, the Shagawmen were cut back.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the target guard of Blika, landed under a press from the son of Viktori, and gave the ball in the foot of Viktor, where the ball was rejected in the network.
Unbelievable 5 to 3 situations appeared when less than ten minutes had passed by the second half of the game, which slowed down on the end of the market.
Despite fine opportunities for both teams to add to the limits, including two Kwame Quee Deaths from Breakfast, they did not become any more and 5–3 victories of the Break-According Game.
The first victory worked for a few months, from 29 June, and has passed after the victory with 14 points in the third seat, two points from Val, which are above and three from the top of KR.
However, both KR and Valur have a game inside Blika.
IA has to agree with the third loss in the order of the department, but the team has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the fallside.
Despite the words of the White House, the Wulpa team is not in danger
Yesterday, the Hvolpas Team’s manufacturers justified not to stop showing the child’s substance in the near future.
The statement follows Cayleigh McEnany, the media representative of the White House, that the factors, including legal dogs, are victims of “exclusion cultures” (e. cancel culture).
Canadian manufacturers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and published that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Hvolpa Force.
A number of television scenarios dealing with police work have been taken from the exhibition in the United States in the past following contradictions against police violence.
However, the Wulpa team is not there, despite the fact that it has provoked its content on social media.
At a newspaper meeting in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that Trump President of the United States would be against the “exclusion culture ” and especially when the police arrived.
The wording refers to the fact that individuals or companies raise hard reactions to social media and are called after the participant is defended in a contradictory sense.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw that shows on the Hvolpas team, children’s agents, were stopped.
Likewise the factors of Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
She added that Lego’s Danish toy manufacturer took a law enforcement from sale, but no foot is for the claim, according to the Defendant Lego.
However, the reality factors of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken from the vision of the western sea.
Both factors are included in the area for showing pictures of real police work without allowing for individuals who appear there.
Together for 29 years — Sometimes Envy and Defiance
Christian Tomaze’s daughter, a family therapy scholar, answers the questions of a reader on matters relating to the family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, we have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together, and we feel well, but we both have the team as if we are losing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
Sometimes this has caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around himself, thinking about abandonment, even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a marrow that always hangs upon us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question and I am glad you have so open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about this in each corner, you couldn't talk about this and even take some steps you could see later.
All on the top of the tables, isn't it always the best?
Strong self - image has the most predictive prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger self - image you have, the more likely it is that you have a marriage with a strong self - image.
The reason why youth - age relationships are not always all - life - time, is often that people grow in each way, but in cases where there is a valuable effect, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to form in your largest formation years, you can conclude that you have grown together and have had a positive effect on each other’s self - formation.
We are composed of the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is formed by how you listen.
The way I show me depends on how you see me.
A relationship forms who we are.
Can you turn the example and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many years give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be much more than the defects.
You have formed each other for years, and then you can say that you are customized in millimeters each other.
That's more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You are talking about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind you that major changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also accompanied by comfishes for which you are not ever excited.
You may be losing from restarting, learning to be alone again, knowing a new person, and bringing together families.
These are following new challenges, different problems, and potentially something new and exciting.
But this does not just follow a pink cloud and happiness, no, in your age, this can become a drowsing-complicated task, which may never be as good as you have already done to each other.
Is that worth it?
Would you not also advise to focus on what you can do to increase your excitement, unpredictability, and newnesses in your relationship?
You haven't put a shoe on your hill.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate you aren't getting?
What can you give your spouse that you have never done before?
Maybe you need to sit down and re-define your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is a considerable greater obscureness to various forms of relationship, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open connections, multi-assess, or to decide to stop temporarily.
I'm not telling you what to do, but no expert in your solutions, but perhaps it would lighten these heavy moors that swept over you, if you looked into this and thought in solutions.
What do you need to be so confident that fear is gone?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean that you're able to do something together.
Use it as a strength and keep your hands in the direction of your solution.
We urge readers to send their questions and disadvantages to Christians in e-mail to: homebandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the family corner, of course without name and in full faith.

Bidens' Kosningateym refuses “Fox News Sunday” on an interview one week after the interview Chris Wallace at Trump
In the last week, Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace, President Trump doubted that the expected President Democrata, Joe Biden, would deal with the questionnaire that Wallace had to fall on Trump.
We may never get the answer to that question — at least not forever.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the observers that Bidens had told Fox News that he was “not free ” at the interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democrata class, Joe Biden, would plumb himself in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ In the week, we asked Bidens’ electorate for an interview, and they said that the former president was not free. ”
“ We continue to ask each week, ” he added.
Trump’s cosnational team has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and news conferences during interviews during the age of crown viruses.
Though Biden has recently restarted his electoral trip, Trump and his companions have continued to be the former president of the warranty for “hidding ” in his home in Delaware.
However, Bidens’ loyalty to public events has not been undertaken by his proclamation, since the latest studies show that Biden has a good forum on Trump both in the country and in the main fighting countries.
The average Real Clear Politics indicates that the president was 7 percent down in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all the four nations in 2016 when he turned them to the Rebellic Group when he won the battle about the White House.
In the latest research of Fox News Poll, Biden has a forum in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside the skelk limit in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a little preliminary in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important countries of fighting in these elections.
And research suggests that the formerly trusted nations, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between the Trumps and the former president of the war.
Presidential elections in which a sitting president is offering for another period of time in the White House are often voting for that president – and this seems to be the case now in the fight between Trumps and Bidens.
The most modest matters have been the crown virus and the economy that are inclined by the patriarch — as well as the president’s performance and history in both categories.
Kanye West and his throat with psychiatrists
Today, the musician Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, apologize for the words he had made to fall into an excessive chest.
As a psychiatrist, a psychologist considers that he gets his creative power, but psychiatrists say importantly that people are taking medicines to keep the disease in harm.
The canye West rapper is not just one of the most first and most impressive musicians at the same time, but is not even famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been a great deal before open tents.
It was very attentionful when he earlier this month announced that he would offer himself to the president of the United States, and he kept the feelings and the distressless speech.
Later, a few specially manifested himself on Twitter, as he claimed, among other things, that his wife was trying to put him in the hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram where she asked people to show her husband and family understanding; he had psychiatric disease, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want himself to seek help.
After that, he has asked her apologize.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is considered that about one percent of people get psychiatric.
Ferdinand Johansson is a psychiatric doctor in the London Hospital, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so decisive shame for the individuals and especially for the families and their loved ones.
This abuse, or mania, can destroy relationships and work, and may cause a great sadness.
And then the other sides, the depression, it is often very dangerous, for it is a high incidence of suicide in that group.
So I loved her to say this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Unnstein’s son, the chief of psychiatrist, himself has struggled with psychiatrists — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very magnificent imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly contrabasses, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so excessively creative, excessively powerful and clear in his powerful relationship thought, because you will have to be with this relationship thought that we have been able to try to go into a superior condition so well."
Canye West doesn't want to take psychiatric drugs, because he thinks they're pulling out of his creative gift.
He has discussed the psychiatrists, including the Ye plate.
The hall says it's his choice not to take medicines.
“ Many feel that this creative element, which is part of this unreasonable ties and superb creation of the fire that it has, is naturally the defects of many suffering, and the valleys and dark bases and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, however, explains importantly that people with psychiatric disease are treated.
“ If you have a lot of anxiety or a mania, you will not create any wonderful things, you are just on the side.
And like when people go into severe depression, people are completely lamed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Absolutely, ” says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right dose and this way to make it a balance between helping him as most, and to destroy as a reminder of him and his abilities and his creative power. ”

"People" agent wants a gun, a busy car, and an injecting West - Said undermen to be the deep-state devil.
Politically appointed U.S. Messenger in this country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who claims to have a shooting weapon in CBS news today.
Starting CBS: “Despite being positioned in one of the most secure kingdoms of the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter was “sick ” about his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
In addition, CBS refers to 12 diplomatas, directors and former representatives who are aware of the matter.
The result of Gunters was to demand by the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they wished for permission by the Messenger to walk by armed in this country.
He should also have wished for a busy car traveling with him between places in Iceland and the city of injection.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself whether some threats resulted in the security of the missionary, but the representatives of the American governments said that the missionary was expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, CBS, would have been revealed by lifeguards in the Icelandic newspapers, and if we have been able to meet the demands of the messenger.
According to CBS, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to express himself on the matter with CBS.
However, after its authors in this country, the United States news Office has no wish to be given to local governments.

Since then Gunter accepted in May, when he said he had created a “invisible” working environment in the council, and he has already had seven subways, so - called Deputy Chief of Mission, the subways of the transmitter who are also broadcasted diplomatics.
They were all tested by the American Foreign Ministry.
The first one was sent away from the messenger, “for his appearance did not bear. ”

It is also said that Gunter had trouble following the commands of the Foreign Ministry in Washington, and, as he said, he refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 phenomenon shielded.
He left the missionary in the hands of his employees for months.
When he said he was going to work from his home in California except that the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, has ordered to return.
Cut finally backwards
Lastly, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His newman, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their requests to the United States Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to express himself with CBS, nor with the DV request.

Polland will tell himself about the European Convention on Prevention of Violence against Women
Polish judicial government says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention on Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legislative act of the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Court of Justice of Poland, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “injurious” in which he demands that schools teach children about sex from a social perspective.
Ziobro said of the weekend that on Monday, he would begin preparing a formal process of declaring the contract.
“This ideological element is related to the attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, with regard to study, attitude and conviction of the young generations of Polish, based on the conclusion that we believe is wrong, that biological sex is old and that everything is actually about socially cultural sex. ”
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the agreement on child education and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT people are inappropriate.
“We also reject the LGBT factors in the discussion on family relations, because this is a view held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “angry” that Polland would like to tell himself about the agreement.
The Warsaw protested about 2,000 people on Friday, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, outside the Office of the Rights Associations of Ordo Luris, who supports the country’s proclamation of the contract.
“ We will not be victims, ” they called.
Congresses also took place in other cities in Poland.
Polland signed the Istanbul Convention to Prevent and fight violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and completed it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, an enginemaker in the Heide Hall, dead 81 years old
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, which was part of a quarti-course accompanying empire, including his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first engineer who was taken into the Heidshall Nascar, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his dead cause.
His execution has not been reported.
While other members of his family were roamed for their capabilities behind the governor, Maurice Petty won the nickname "The Governor" for his skills with the screw key.
He helped his family to work 198 races and seven titles in the NASCAR department, and also built machines that guaranteed the Victory of Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The boss was one of the most important engineers in the history of NASCAR, ” said the Chairman and Chairman Jim France.
“He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to reach his excesses in the sports area.
Though Maurice was known for his work under the hat, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what needed to bring his cars to the victory. ”
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, at Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the runway when he was small and his knowledge in the engineering soon became a vital factor in landing Lee Petty victory in 54 races and three masters.
He struggled 26 times in the NASCAR cup between 1960 and 64, seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what is happening under the machine shelter rather than behind the steering, which proved to be a trace for his older brother, who relyed on his machines during his victory.
Richard, then called the King, won the first Mastership with the Governor in 1964 with the Plymouth library.
They again triumphed in 1967, then two years in order of 1970 and 1971, and reached three additional titles before the eighth decade ended.
With these seven titles on the back, they share the largest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers NASCAR and was involved in building up one of the NASCAR peak teams,” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Though Petty is recorded as 212, he calls for a great deal of more than 250 victories, if he is taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The manager will be remembered forever as the best machine in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, the wife of Maurice Petty to 52 years of age, died in 2014.
He was also a cousin of the former driver and mediator Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, chief officer of the pitch.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and powerful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his inheritance and name will be stored in our memories, kept in the air and preserved for all the future, ” said Kelley.
"We send our deepest compassionates to the Petty family."

U.S. officials have discussed openly on punishment against Serbia if more weapons are being transported from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of nearby NATO countries.
In the western countries and in the neighbouring countries of Serbia, people see anxiety about the weapons of Russia and the Chinese in Serbia.
Throughout the tens of the 1990 ’ s, volunteers are growing in the Balkans, which depended on a human civil war.
The Atlantic Federation was interrupted by Serbia to stop bloody operations against the Cosovó - Albana separation in 1999.
Despite the formal efforts to enter the European Union, the Serbian populist leader has further strengthened its political and military relationship with Kreml and Beijing.
Serbia, which and Russia and China, do not recognize the autonomy of Cosovo, the United States and most Western countries.
Cardiac attack: Probability of this fatal condition may decrease by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain goodness can be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a collective analysis of cranary disease that reaches over five decades.
The main signs of cerebrovascular disease (including cardiac dehydration) are three: chest pain (heartang), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms of disease may be cardiovascular and severe dysfunction.
“Succolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoid, methylxantine, polyphenol and steroidic acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high concentration fitaproteine, collects “slow” cholesterol – the type of cholesterol that triggers the heart – and transfers it into the liver.
The “slow” cholesterol (low concentration fituprotine) is broken down into the liver and then distinguished from the body.
However, the new study does not determine the dose sizes or types of chocolate to be taken.
It is not clear whether the participants were eating dark chocolate, lactose glucose or other chocolate.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the use of cocoa (seeing in chocolate) decreased the risk of cardiovascular abnormalities.
Scientists believe that flavonoid, which is found in shocked, decreases blood pressure and improves vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygens and nutrients into the body and transports waste.
Lifestyle factors were not described in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had recognized the eating of chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
So she added that they could regularly exercise physical activity and feel less stressful.
“Every of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system," it added.
Coles replaces plastic toys for books in a new collection campaign
“ We have really listened, and that was a key element in the preparation of the project, ” said Ronson.
“ We do not believe that people want to recover the books — we think it will have them, but they can rejoice at home if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new introductory campaign has been working long before COVID-19 came to history, and despite the danger, she believes that the timetable for the new campaign has been “now good” because of the great amount of time parents now spend with her children.
The articles have declared concerns because consumers have become tired in the continuation of the largest market recording campaigns, but Ronson says that there is no evidence of tiredness yet.
“ We have not seen anything like that yet, but we have always our eyes open to this, ” she said.
“ We analyse very much of the data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we give away is inconsistent with our clients.
It was Cloes who ruined the course for collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in the middle of 2018 was the drive force behind the best fourteenth sale of the large market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the large market to increase its sales, and now last, the environmentally friendly presentation of Discovery Garden traders offers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have a lesser effect this time, as UBS sensors foretell an increase in sales in large Australian largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that businesses can expect more diverse collection campaigns in the future, and that wars such as Little Shop are likely to be rare.
“ It is a great deal of gathering announcement campaigns around the world that we look at, and we are constantly inspiring from other countries, ” she said.
“ We need to do this to ensure that we are increasingly doing better with our customers. ”
Ready to walk 5 rings around the country in summer
The photographer and material manufacturer, John Ragnar Johansson, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less on the surface of Iceland since the world’s age.
John graduated in business science at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but now he is working on travelling and making markets for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with John, or April, when he traveled all over the Westfire and stayed in his car.
Whatever is a year, he has been walking about five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has walked in countless daily journeys here and there.
What time has it been?
“ For someone like me who is always on the spot and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It's more weather and society that matters all.
Recently, after opening the roads in June, they have gone a lot up to the highland.
They always stand on their ways because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip in the year, but then we went 25 together to 5 large cars at the riverside and then to the river water."
What's your face in summer?
“ It’s very exciting for me in the next, but I was doing a stunning study with DIVE, and I’m now going to take a coffee trip around Iceland and Iceland.
Then I was adding a brim board to my "dotass" so I'm going to get more out of the sea than before.
I'm going to go over a 10-day "solo" trip with everything I need my back, but it'll be clear later in summer where I'm going.
Otherwise, I'm going to get a lot up to the highway next year, because it's not possible to review that area all year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Jökul’s wage has been part of my life since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I lived at the roots of the Breedmark Meal, and since that time, I have always felt well in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've come there more than 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“I'm going to bring one perle from each country, but it's: Mulagllows in Southern, Eastern Municipality, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, Red Sand in the West Feather, Snowfish Sea Coal in Western and last but not later...
What is indispensable in the journey?
“I'm not going to land unless I have the following in the car: Good vase light, hanging noise, lopapeysa, hunting knifes, farmers, refrigerators, and edbits... those who know me know what I'm talking about.”
Looking for 24 robbers who fear being drunk from the island of Malachi
KUALA LUMPUR, Malasia (AP) — Malasia’s authorities said on Sunday that 25 calm refugees who are afraid to have drowned after a boat away from the Langkawi Travel Island, northern Malasia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - standing officer at Malachi’s National Holy Guardian, said that the first information of the police showed that only one of the 25 calms who had swept from the boat had reached singing to the country.
According to Zawawi, the man who survived was looking for help from the police late on Saturday and has been maintained while the matter is examined.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim calms have escaped Mjanmar for military operations, and many of them live in superfluent refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the inhabitants of Malasia, who have been a time of decisive boats who praise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airs were used in the search.
He said that the land - sanctuary will also make seafarers in the region and authorities in the neighbouring country of Thailand a warning to help the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
In the last month, the authorities of Malachi refugees held 269 in guard and found a body on board a boat that suspected that they had been used with a smuggling away from Langkawi coasts, but they said that he was willing to go back to the sea.
Later, Malachi’s National Holy Guardian said that the 269 individuals had been transported from a larger ship with twenty people who were supposed to have died and that their bodies were poured into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malasia could not accept more calm refugees because of the age of the crown virus.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to the sea.
In Malasia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as about 100.000 refugees and refugees — including 10,000 royals — are registered by the United Nations Refugee Institute.
Inhabitants of Aswan collect, watch and return a farm of chocolate to Sudan after a truck
On Sunday, on the gate of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell in a bunch of heat attacks, the transfer trailing to Sudan with a lot of tonnes of chocolate fell on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple.
The inhabitants were grouped together to help the driver where he was lying and save the warning that had sworn.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, declared his position so that the driver “was walking along our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We should help people in need, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had come to a ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the carriage of the car, which is estimated to be three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said that the villagers have been on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the farm as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the farm and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to give the harmful driver water and shelter, says Bahr, and added that they just wanted to ensure that he arrived and from the village safely.
There were already brotalams at the assembly, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
“ The home age alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect at times of trouble, ” says a report conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of the American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organisational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other debt debts that are about the genetic sin of our nation and the race equality that has struck our country from its establishment. ”
The study reviews the familiar matters related to the familiarity of the sitting: lack of real relationships between categories, programming of limited opportunities for communication, excessive interaction of power in leaders' positions, constant demands for funding, limitation of cooperation between classes, negative impact on media operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important choices for seniors are often precourses and the final discontinuation of minorities.
It is also warned that the plenary will be transferred more to the network because of the world’s age, where such a system that allows choices by means of representatives without the need to travel to Washington could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote meeting reaches an investment, it would be a serious backward for attempts to increase the interaction between classes, as stated in the report.
“ The congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the network, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ However, despite the need, such things should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the sitting needs “more than less interaction between the senators, face to face. ”
They need to explore each other’s territories more, have courtesy conversations to find together and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly relevant during the week, when Ted Yoho, the Senator of the Repeople from Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Senate of Democrata from New York, with the seeds and his companions in the Rebuquenal Group, agreed to attack Liz Cheney, the Senator of the Repeophies in Wyoming with a hostile word.
Ms. Val Demings talks about the presidential office, Trump's hearing it for accomplishments
Deputy Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not ashamed of discussing her interest in the office of a presidency of the potential government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for the office.
This respected member of the group of blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a direct broadcast because of #FIYAH! The live party and told her about her story, an actor and the commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and started with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of a worker and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Representative in the judgment of Donald Trump in January.
No matter whether the Senior Department is injured by Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth president who is accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the representative was held: “It was worth this, and it has been worth every day. ”
She added that, despite the disappointment, democrats would have been obliged to follow the matter, regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings clearly stated that she was against Trump’s arrest of Roger Stone, who was sentenced to lie before the plenary (including other crimes) as well as his accomplishment to other criminals who were sentenced to a similar crime, when she said: “The innocentness to get your friends, those who have angry and deceived to hide over your misery. ”
Deamings is on the top of Joe Biden's list of potential prosecutors for the presidency, which also hold Karen Bass President CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former congressor of Georgia, the Chambala Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms City Director Atlanta, Susan Rice, former U.S.A. embassy and some others.
She, however, pointed out that only one person would decide who invited Joe Biden for autumn.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she put her hand to her mouth while she laughed and felt whispering to those who looked at the direct broadcast, adding “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of the political views of each one, the historical books view this period as the time of development of American politics and attitudes.
This didn't happen to Demings.
She recalled that the number of women present to the US Defense President is the opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof” – especially for women of African origin.
“ It is precisely those opportunities that I work so hard for me all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they do not have enough money or that they are of wrong sex, ” she said.
The congress woman decided to ensure that the Democratic Group’s and Biden’s electoral committee would advertise and work with Black Press of America to make as many as possible choose.
“ I will call Tom Perez (president of the Democratic Group) and I will put this on the top of my list, ” promised Demings.
She agreed that this had to happen now rather than later in the election struggle.
When she answered the ex - foreign minister Hillary Clinton’s words that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the choices, and another edition that says that the president is preparing to reach himself, survived the Demings: “It’s so much that it’s upstairs to reach myself, that I’m insane. ”
“ But who would ever do this other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break up laws and ignore the governance file in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he doesn't endure losing.
I can quite believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."

Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been appointed to the court in Gurugram after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been driven for protesting the literature and false news in the company’s programs.
The matter is mentioned in the Gurugram District Court, and the private court of Sonia Sheokand has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others and asked them to come to court on 29 July, according to the news.

Representative of New York City, says it "finished" all right to exclude a white shuttleman from honor.
A representative who deals with a matter of diversity in New York City's disabled, says that it is “final” OK to keep a white decorator from honour to make everyone black, according to a new news.
The White Cooper Daniel McWilliams has raised a matter of disagreement for race after he was taken out of a group of flag crews at a memorial in November 2017 in order to recall the deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black shuttle players.
The main agent of the shutdown in the field of diversity and accessibility, the lawyer Cecilia Loving, became the decision in the New York State Human Rights Department, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three actors of the department, which, in a historical form, are seen lifting the United States flag at Ground Zero in the days after the attacks on September 11th.
According to the dear McWilliams, he was elected to be one of the flags in honour of the Memorial Act.
Being a fantasy of this action was a “great honor and privilege ” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN law.
However, when he arrived at the action, he was meant to participate in the honour of the President of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for as it was claimed, she had asked that all flagships at the fair would be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old employee of New York City to help in another way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do, it is to accompany the unchanged civilians and set out specially dressed cliffs away from the mess.
McWilliams claims in his law that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honor because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has been working at New York City for 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams for one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and collaborators heard what happened between them, according to New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black one, witnessed the right, the lawyer of McWilliam, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “Why, praying that everyone be black in honor is not discrimination? ”
“ No, that's not, ” said Loving, according to New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving whether it would be okay to ask that everyone be black in honor, which she answered, “All. ”
Loving explained that it would be OK to replace a white person for a black person, “to raise our ability and different origins to create proud, consistent, and support for each other. ”
McWilliams first presented a friend of discrimination from the race of the New York NCB in January 2018.
He then raised a case against Wilson, New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams presented his boyfriends, Wilson’s supporters had revenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard of you, they told me you would act like this, and now you know who I am. ”
Sullivan wrote that it would have been “awesome ” to exclude McWilliam from the honour of the mess and to indicate that there was nothing in the lockdown.
“ If you are a black person and you are disadvantaged to a white person at work, you will mostly be reminded, ” said Sullivan.
According to the law, Wilson received “one hour’s advice” for her treatment at McWilliam.
During the time, a white person, as a black person’s misunderstanding, receives “reasonable punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“The New York City has created a policy and process intended to please the members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist manner, excuse their actions and help them ... and this needs to stop," wrote Sullivan.

Thousands of inhabitants of Khabarovsk still demand the decree of Putin
Thousands of the inhabitants followed the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the captivity of the District Manager in the so-called territories, southed in Eastern Russia, and the installation of his heritage, who has never lived in the province.
The former district manager, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity and twenty thousands of city residents protested when he was arrested and arrested in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering murder on three businessmen 15 years ago.
In the recent week, Furgal was formally appointed as a province manager and his 39 - year - old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, to his place with little impression.
Is Degtaryev said unexperienced and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk, and called the inhabitants after his statement the fastest.
These calls have made Degtaryev as a wind in the ears.
Yesterday Protestants were smaller than in the first Protestants, or 15 to 20 thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the statement of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
“We want the province manager to be released, because we think his arrests are very likely to be illegal," has the AFP news Office after half-thirds of the contradictor, Alina Slepova.
She claims that the agents of Kremlar had arrested Furgal “to defend their own interests, but not the interests of the province. ”
The Chabarovsk police made protesters unreasonable, despite the unreasonable violation of the current meeting ban because of the Coronal Virus Age.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who gathered at the Pusjkin Tower to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in work, says the British magazine Guardian.
The group of Furgal, the Free Democratic Group of Russia, is a group of the harsh-line nationality, and is considered by politicians rather devoted to the Crime Government in most cases.
The same political reporters, however, informed the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the District Chairman elections two years ago — large and unthreated — had been a considerable stroke for Putine and the United Russian United States, and suggested that Cremler’s fate in the eastern regions would be weak.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and moved to Moscow, where he was waiting for justice.
It is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were made, but the third went out of the dust.
Sarah Rainsford, newspaper BBC in Moscow, says the followers of Furgal, who enjoy great popular homes, convinced that the charge and the arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited for him to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his violation.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
Last weeks, it has been realized that many bones are still in the cabinet in relation to race law in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to take place and take action for everyone to be welcomed in sports.

Pictures on the desk that the Queen sat with, among other things, Wilhelm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprins, and his wife, Camillah, as well as Prince Philip.
Yet, Meghan and Harry were not able to make sure that Archie had been born in May, but the boy was mentioned as “the eighth grandchildren ” of her Majesty.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends, ” since they“ were hard to overcome surfacely courtesy ” and met only several times.
Thus, yesterday, Harry and Willhelm’s brother’s distrust began a few years before his relationship and Meghan began, but he reached a maximum for Willhjálm and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duchess of Sussex felt that he was a “warning disc” of events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is said that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history. ”
Consultants of the Consumer Group are accused of an academic leader to want public employees to “live forever. ”
Consultants of the Conservation Group accuse a professional leader to want public employees to “live forever ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work
Officers were accused of wanting employees “to be at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
The Consumer Group’s congresses were angry when the public and public employees’ workforce told their companions to ask their feet when their officers ordered them to return to their jobs.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “inappropriate ” that the necessary public service, such as the release of a roadbook, would be stopped while staff on the general market would have worked hard to keep the society walking in the crown virus age.
“ It is unfavourable that people refuse to return to their work while workers in warehouses and workshops throughout the country have continued to work so that public staff could eat while this has been done, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go to summer vacation, but they cannot do so because of the people who refuse to return to their jobs, even though it is safe.
Officers cannot maintain this policy of living at home forever — especially now when we know that people can return to work in a safe way."
After the last week’s president’s call, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed director of the public service, announced that a board would “should disappear from the fact that employees in public service work their homes, and hurry their return to their workplaces to August 1st. ”
The company of public and public employees expressed their companions, who believed about 200,000 people, that they would not have to meet this requirement, and that was a matter of politics.
A speaker of the public and public employees, the largest public employee’s workforce in Britain, said that the need to return to workplaces “was not provided with health and safety of our social partners in advance, or to strengthen the economy.
This is a loneliness of political pressure from the Conservation Group, which demands that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to social partners is clear: If you are doing your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, don't take it as of course that you need to do it."
The issue is increasingly unpleasant with a delayed version of road tickets because employees are working at home, but about 400 000 people are now said to wait for their application.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has now published that it will ‘let us hurry’ applications from the British for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
The public and public employees’ company has acknowledged that some have had to wait for up to 143 days for road letters, but claims that “small and often narrow offices” make the 4000 staff of the roadworthiness service difficult for a week to keep the necessary distance.
David Davis, the former minister of government, urged the leaders of the associations to “go wisely ” and seek to cooperate with the government to return people to their places of work.
So he added that if he was in government, he would ask a practitioner: “What do you want, that people be home for all summers? ”
However, several largest companies in Britain have also ignored Johnson’s recommendations to people return to work.
Study at larger jobs with a total of about 400,000 employees showed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Behavior of the History may be an important part of the sentence
The gift has grown, but understanding and consciousness should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this shortage of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is learned from Australian history.
The fact is that without any action, the only lesson specifically discussing our history — “Saga Australia ” for 12 grades — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
In the last year, only 628 students in the Victory graduate graduated in the history of Australia of a total of 49.324 graduates, or just 1%.
In the last six years, this figure has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students have registered each year.
The first reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in 12 classes is that little has been done during the previous years of study to raise their interests.
History is not even a unique study area, but it is subject to the broader “consciousness. ”
Thus, students completed at the 7th and 8th class only one short unit on the “original and island scarce of Torres and their culture”.
In the nineth and tenth years, another unit of Australia is in the world wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all what is learned about Australia’s history in the primary school years.
In the nineth and ten years, another optional unit is the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victory schools.
First, a story must become an independent study, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since a story is only taught as part of consciousness, it has little space in the study program.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in the field of science but have not educated in history.
Historical skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
We need to advise more specialists in history to ensure that such skill is taught in a accessible and exciting manner.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 will have to be a compulsory article.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, because they had to learn the material from the ground.
Knowledge of the story alone and see no deep gaps between races.
But without it, as clearly shown in the Victory’s study program, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elis in a final game of Europe - Isaac divided into a half game
Aron Elis Dundar's son has come to the final play of a European seat in the Danish electoral department in footballs.
Isak Bergmann Johnson played only a first half game with the Norrskaping peak against the Falkenberg bottom in Sweden.
Aron Elis was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play a decisive role in the pre-competition of the European department.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it wonders whether the joints end up after the final round of the top part of the Danish section later today.
Aron Elis played the whole game at 1 to 1 at the same time with Horsens at the outlet today, but OB had worked the former game of the teams at home, 3 to 1, and thus worked a total of 4 to 2.
Isaac was at the beginning of the Norrköping team, which was unexpected 2 to 0 under the previous half of the game against the Falkenberg bottom of the Swedish election department.
Norrskaping made a threefold division at the beginning of the second half of the game, and Isak was one of those who had to deviate.
Norrköping was estimated to be equal to Falkenberg at 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
But it was still time for Norrskaping to equip hell in the last hour, 3–3.
The North Creation continues on the top, with 24 points, four points before Elfsburg, and five points before Malmö, who is playing for good later today.
The step made Falkenberg fit to get out of the bottom for a while, but the team is a stairway from the top of the city of Helsing, and Kalmar, who has a game for good.
Collections of National Festivals in Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja Victory daughter established the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020” to gather records of the National Festival that the Eyes are going to celebrate next weekend.
Many are going to tent in their gardens and be happy with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Watta in the "Heily" section of the Wave.
“ Nothing has yet come in, which is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group so that they are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilia.
Something is about the Eyes to have a tent party at home in a garden.
“ People have talked about being with their own [feast], perhaps tending in the garden and hoping together the family as they always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ A man expects people to spend time with his people.
However, she is likely to say that many are simply not going to be at the site, “but still to hold some little National Festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to reimburse the books purchased, but Anna thinks that many residents are rather trying to make a record on the next year’s celebration.
“Man is even investing now in the funds and making it valid by 2021.”
“ I am a great nation’s man, I love the preparation and all around this, but sometimes something comes into the life that you do not rule, and it is just that way, ” says Anna, but it has somewhat suggested that people are asking whether the Eyes can’t release the National Festival “one time. ”
Anna Lilia claims not to have established the group for himself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival, but to gather records of Sales Holy Festivals in the Eyes this year.
“ What did people in these strange times do?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then I'm going to identify someone who uses such permissions in something but I was just creating some area where people can insert what it's doing."
In addition, the burning of the feather has been loaded up each year.
“ I think many are excited to get burnt on Friday evening.
Of course, the only thing that makes a line in the account is that the prophecy is no specific."
“ It will be turned on in this burning, but it just needs to be found out how it will be, ” says Anna Lilia.

Will Prince Andrés be mentioned in new cases of sexual crime?
The British Royal family now prepares to respond to possible new information in judicial documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell will be made public
Among those found in these 80 pages of documents are items with witnesses Maxwell from 2016
The display of these pages could also put a great pressure on the Prince Andrés, where there is interaction between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, meant a sexual slave of the disgraced American financer, claimed in judicial documents that she had been forced to cooperate with Prince Andrés.
Prins Andrés is now preparing to protect the possible publication of information during the week with the even more harmful charges of his friendship with the child adolescent Jeffrey Epstein and his meant witchman, Ghislaine Maxwell.
During the week, the U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The display of these vast documents would be a shock for the 58-year-old Maxwell, since they have a large part of their witnesses before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “reasonable questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put a great pressure on the Prince of André, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts meant a sexual slave of the disgraced American financer, claimed in 2015 in judicial documents that she had been forced three times to cooperate with Andrew.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected these claims.
A computer mail from 2015 that has been leaked and BBC appeared last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We are no doubt that the Duke will be rebellious
There he said to the supervisor: “Let me know when we can talk, with certain questions that I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell answered: “It has information, call me when you have a free time. ”
Last night, an author who stands near Andrew said: “The Duke of Jordan has not done anything wrong, so we are not worried about the opening of the court.
As courts in the United States have strived to point out, it does not mean that an accusation is true, even though it is found in judicial documents.
American courts have encouraged the media and the public to take care of the most careful treatment of the accusations found in the legal documents.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have full rebellion in the next weeks."
Maxwell is now maintained at the Main Center of Manhattan, waiting for some of Epstein’s victims who were under law from 1994 to 1997.
It is also due to harm for refusing to report on his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last talked to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s violent headship, which is now under the surname of Giuffre, which she took after marriage.
About 40 pages of a total of 418 of these witnesses were made public during the last year, but after the decision of Judge Presna in New York last week, more things could be opened first on Thursday.
The lawyer Maxwell was given one week to submit an application.
Epstein felt dead in his prison cell in New York earlier when he was waiting for sexual crime.
Research police are looking for a criminal attack on Edinburgh’s streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him an attack that could prove lasting.
The 29 - year - old victim in Drum Street, Gilmerton, was advised between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious anxiety.
The investigator, Dale Miles, who is conducting the investigation, said: “This was a violent and unreasonable attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in the 40 ’ s, about 180 cm in height and strongly grown.
He was shortly cut and dark hair in a white ball, dark pants and dark shoes.
Miles, a investigator, said: “I prayed all those who were in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious to give up. ”
The Commander wants a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Messenger in Iceland, wants a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
He has been said to be “profit” about his security since he came to land last year.
This is mentioned in the CBS news, which also says that this will Gunter, despite his functioning in “one of the most secure kingdoms of the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs to leave it with the Icelandic government that he can carry a gun.
Then he has been asking for a busy car and a west that protects him from knife tongues.
CBS, however, repeatedly reported that Gunter is not in danger to Iceland.
The CBS reports that the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request was made from the United States for the possible weapons event of Gunter because the authorities did not express security measures for foreign residents.
Although no request has been made, the news office’s authors say.
The CBS also has it after his authors have been told that Gunter should not be sought to carry weapons, because it would be taken as a condemnation in this country.
Gunter is unexperienced as an inhaler, but has been a skin disease physician in California for years.
He's active in the United States Republic, and he's a great supporter of Donald Trump, President.
He raised recent attention here in the country when he spoke about “the invisible Chinese virus. ”
CBS also reports that Gunter was deeply depressed by the American Embassy Council in Reykjavik.
He had already seven next workers in the May message from last May.
He has, among other things, accused them of belonging to the “Deep Kingdom, ” which is supposed to be the network of American officials who work against Trump, and reacted in anger to the fact that one bar snowd into his office.
The missionary traveled to Washington D.C. in February before a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter was said to have wanted to work from California, but after all, Mike Pompeo, foreign minister of the United States, had to order him to return and do it in May.
The home game form is the key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games in the future when the adherents get back to a game
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the electoral department began again, but he says that if the audiences were released to play, it would be easier to maintain a good game at home.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six pieces above that have lost more in the home.
The trainer Portuguese said that if such victories were possible without the adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them, some kind of activity can be built up, where the play plan is in the front,” he said.
“ But I think that it is much more powerful to do it with the adventures, because then the emotional side of the game, which is the next only with the help of a fan at home. ”
Mourinho considers that with stronger competitions it is increasingly difficult to maintain the long victory periods in a home site that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up in the past three times.
But this is also a key element in determining whether the end of the period reaches its goals, especially in matching games and neighborhood laws, where the atmosphere of the field can divide creatures.
“I believe that the policy of the electoral department is that it becomes more and more difficult to make this unfair appreciation because of what has been good.”
“ However, it is important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, we have gathered a number of steps with victories in home games. ”
“ I am pleased with the final of home games in the past, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see a victory against Arsenal with the hole full of Tottenham adventures.
This is a consciousness that is built up slightly and slightly."
Buyers excited for demanded lifestyle property in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better ” is clearly the motto of new large owners of the Lovely Bank’s district, which was recently sold at 1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting buyers looking for a lifestyle property near the center of Geelong, they increased to see this 1,35 hectare land property, where there is a car shelter for 14 cars, swimming pools and views over Corio Rivers.
Joe Grgic, a property hall in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that the offer in the land property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days since she was placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove again for sale
Home options for isolation
“ We received a number of offerings from various members, ” said Grgic.
“The property is sold to a homeman who is very excited. ”
The land property is accompanied by four rooms of houses on two hills, including special bathrooms that are large enough to sleep in a sofa.
The new owners have choices of three rooms and can use a refined kitchen and updated outdoor area with views over the pool.
“ This was how the property was composed, that it was three rides, and that she was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ In this way, interested buyers from Melbourne, who wondered what the property was in the middle of the area, but still with the landscape.
“ I have people who lost and buyers who are still looking for. ”
He said that the bed-style storage area, which includes a double truck and a free-standing shelter of more than 10-12 drivers, was perfect for traders or to store a wheelchair and a trailer.
Thoughts their security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been vigilant of his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how the CBS News of the United States’ Ambassadors in Iceland begins, which represents a number of CBS records from the United States’ Foreign Service.
The CBS report claims that Gunter, at the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wished that he would be granted a special authorisation of the Icelandic governments to carry weapons.
Then he should also have desired for a truck, as well as for the ideas of a west that could protect him from a knife attack.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is really threatened in Iceland, but, according to officials’ information, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any special danger.
In spite of this, the American Embassy in Iceland recently published after full - time life guards, including in the morning magazine of July 18th, but CBS reported that it is done to sleep concerns to Gunter.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on a serious security measure in connection with its missions, but always states that security is ensured by a preventive way.
The Ministry does not answer questions concerning Gunter’s request for arms living, and the Icelandic Ministry does not want to tell us whether the United States formally wanted to have a gun by the missionary officer and usually say not to the security of foreign missions.
However, according to their Icelandic authors, CBS has never been submitted to the request for this matter, and according to three American officials, Gunter was received from these plans, where they could be condemned to homemen in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been admissible to the U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed as a transmitter last year, but he will already have divided his warrior seven times.
Thus, the first warranty warrant is said to have prepared himself for a long time and learned Italian only to have been denied the position in the last minute because Gunter ‘does not read on him’ at their first meeting.
His followers have not been much better under Gunter’s control.
Governments of the United States Foreign Ministry are said to be conscious of the position in the Icelandic ambassador, but are insisting to intervene in matters related to the President’s close relationship.
Besides all of this, Gunter is deceived to follow the various rules of the foreign service and respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, which was said to have refused to return to Iceland in the following months, leaving its temporary place of work, and in the middle of the world’s age.
Will Gunter even wished to do his work remotely and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, wished for it in particular.
According to the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permission to the end of the conference and the Crown Virus age, but according to CBS, many within the Council will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not until May, following Pompeo’s contact with him and please asked him to return to the Iceland Embassy.
In addition, CBS is reported on the enemy of Gunter in Iceland, especially in connection with today’s calls for the crown virus “the invisible Chinese virus ” and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of the many, almost unexperienced missionary servants who have been appointed in Donald Trump’s rulership.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata class says a government crises in the country; the Congress Group wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if it was necessary, the Congress Group would have to make a statement of objections outside the presidency’s home.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest to Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said that if it was necessary, the Congress Group’s servants would have to meet the president and objects of seat objections outside the presidency’s home to lead the crise in the country to smell.
At the assembly of the Congress Group, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a voting statement to check whether the majority of the congress members of the group and coherents were in force with him.
“ He said that the government has a majority and wants to go to a vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the headquarters of the Congress Group, after the meeting.
The assembly was held in a hotel where the Chairmans who support Gehlot have held themselves in the last days.
“ The principal minister asked us to be ready to stay longer in the hotel.
If it needed, he said, he would meet the president and also keep peaceful protests outside the house of a Prime Minister," said a class leader.
President Rajasthan can gather the assembly and let the Congress Group show its majority, said the class leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata group had come up on the board of the government of Ashok Gehlot of the chair.
“ The country is now governed by laws and regulations.
Governments are formed and served by the commandment of the people.
Bharatiya Janata has discovered that the government of Rajasthan has been dismissed.
This is a disappointment of 80 million inhabitants of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must call the plenary together in order for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi in the fashion of Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, told the Congress members of the Conference on Saturday that he was prepared to go to the presidential meeting of India to ensure that what he calls “the Bharatiya Janata Council ” in order to take a voting statement of confidence does not take place.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the home of the Kingdom leader of Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press on a meeting, met with the Congress and government of the Congress Group on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were built and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to submit the meeting request again and pointed to six objections.
The certificate will soon be sent to the Head of State.
Gehlot has accused the Head of State to sit down for the assembly, where he is “under pressure” in order to stop the voting procedure, which reduces confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata found the missionary committee at the leadership of the Satish Poonia and the leader of the Governing Resistance of Gulab Chandra Kataria with the Head of State to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the State.

Spencer Grammer's game surrounded outside of Manhattan's restaurant
NEW YORK – The playwoman Spencer Grammar said he's been trying to calm the angry man when he cut her arm and put her friend in her back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, a 36 - year - old, told the US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else would have done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from being worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend saw that a snake at the surface of The Black Ant in the East Village city of Manhattan at 23:30 p.m.
on Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded to receive a reward, and then the restaurant was closed.
Grammer and her friend hurt when they tried to “resolve a conflict between an unknown man and other local guests, ” says the police.
The man ran out of the place after he hurt the right arm of Grammer and put her friend in the mugg with an unknown odd thing, said the police.

“ It touched us very much to get the opportunity to thank them in their own personality, ” said Grammer.
“I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after recording himself in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say that he is not going to flag his wealth in an impressive way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev had the northern Iran Rhys McKee in their battle in the veltivigt of Abu Dabi on Saturday evening when he triumphed his competitor when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed out of the first cycle by making the hit on him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in the history of UFC for a short time between the victory in the modern history of the race, where only ten days had passed since he conquered the British John Phillips in a similarly decisive manner, then in an intermediate way.
Chimaev, with the victory rate of 8-0, received 50,000 U.S. Bonus for the performance of the evening against McKee, and has so fully caught the attention of the MMA world that he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which may be inevitable comparative because of the great difference between the superiority of the Chimaev and the UFC master of lightweight and where he is born in Téténia, which is near the homes of Khabib in Dayestan.
Despite newly discovered famous and economic benefits, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his companion in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for myself, I do this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked about it on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, been aware of Conor McGregor's teams and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social record that he could “reasonably” victory Chimaev with a donor.
There was no poisonous response from the battle cake, which is called “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native language Czech, which said that he would “male Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after being moved to the 19 - year - old country, may not have any financial power, but he is obviously inevitably insufficient to lose his ability to fight.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many battlemen are in the cultivation department?
I can paint them all," he said.
“Give me 77 pounds of masters, 84 pounds of masters, I paint them both, on the same day. ”
The Israelites continue to object to the presidency’s reactions to the world’s age
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel objected to the presidency of many of the land on Saturday and were the largest objections outside the official address of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have been over for a few weeks, but they began because the critics believe that the government’s disadvantage should respond to the crown virus age after initially maintaining the threat of the virus.
On the hands of Netanyahu because of corruption, the prosecution has been further undermined.
“ Bibi, go home, ” said one of the Protestants.
On the second panel, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants were also gathered outside the beach house of Netanyahu in the well - being city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to spread groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called rapid and unorganized re-opening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day rose to 2000.
The economy of the country has been affected by the limitations of the virus and unemployment has increased largely to nearly 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance was not sufficient.
The protests took place in the shadow of judicial prosecution against Netanyahu, which began again during the month.
Interrogations will begin in January.
He is accused of betrayal, faultlessness, and cousinfulness in a series of harmful matters.
Hundreds of Protestants gather in the centre of Los Angeles to show consensus with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 Protestants gathered in the centre of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon for supporting two months of old movements in Portland, Oregon, which focused on state lawyers after conflicts with Protestants.
Similar contradictory meetings took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The meetings in Los Angeles were organized by Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The team went to the headquarters of the police in Los Angeles at First Street and Main Street and then to the main center of the major city area.
The participants also moved to the Alameda Freedom at the National Road 101, but later left it.
A portion of the people saw breaking windows in the state buildings in the center of prayers and was written in the state mark.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people in the Mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the Government of Karnataka
The Eid-ul-Azha festival, or Bakrid, will take place on 31 July and 1 August.

The U.S. Messenger wants a armed lifeguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Messenger in Iceland, thinks his life is threatened by a country and wants to walk with weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. broadcaster repeatedly advertised the lives of “bodyguard” in the Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveiks, the main reason why these jobs were revealed is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes that his life is threatened in Iceland.
Ticket has talked to Icelandian authors and foreigners who are convinced that he is in great danger and why he is of the Jewish families.
What the danger is, is not evident, but the advertisers of Kveiks said that islam terrorists had been named as a threat.
The CBS’s television station discussed the issue on its web this morning and, according to Washington’s officials, Gunter is a victim of persecution, demands to be able to carry himself weapons, to get a hot west, and to armed, in addition to a gun - in - law.
According to CBS, Gunter has been repeatedly said that there is no threat and that the advertising according to “bodyguard” is only to sleep Gunter.
According to Kveiks, the positions at the end of June had not been recruited, but the application fees ran out in February.
According to Kveiks, the United States mission has not been formalised because of these changes.
Neither has been formally desired for increased care or for permission to pass out of the messenger’s walls.
The Icelandic laws are decisive that this is not allowed except with a special authorization from the Kingdom Police Officer.
In the control system, Kveiks Representatives say no information is available on any threat.
The most recent danger assessments of the State Police Officers are somewhat decisive about terrorist attacks.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
According to Kveiks, the presidents of the arrival of a foreign council on the streets of cities and cities in Iceland are not there.
Gunter raised great attention here in the country when he shared the American President's day and called COVID-19 "Chinese Virus".
He had the American and Icelandic flag with the tent.
A radio in Seattle, who was raising Trump's response to protests, now claims to have a gun after the Starbucks-coffee house below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new view of violent protests after heaping Donald Trump President of the United States in June for predicting that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed was that the ceremony was closer to the attorney’s home.
“I feel like I need to buy me a firearm because this will clearly continue to happen," said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that entertainment had “broken” the Starbucks café at the bottom of his multi-bike house.
“Now it's enough, it looks like a street party down in the street from me. Very angry now.”
The response was quite similar when Trump the last month complained that the city manager of Seattle would allow violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These free Democrats are glorious, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, the co-director of the “Danny & Gallant” cooperative radio station ESPN in Seattle, said: “Get through it for curious matters last night and did not see any burning, robbing, or deaths.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the people to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the entertainment and said: “Well done, idiots, ” and noted that he had also seen a few long houses away.
“ Do not have any idea of what is going on, but the cat and I will find out. ”
The reversal did not interfere with people who were inclined to Gallant before his previous view and fashioned messages, such as “Take a lax, ” and“ Yes, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “We wouldn’t eventually take them to this viewing trip we talked about. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Awakened, seeing that a lot of people was tiing “slapping on lax” to me. I laughtered. ”
He said he was standing with his previous claim, as he had passed through the CHAZ self-control area of anarchists and although it wasn't as bad as it had been designed.
“ So they were burned and robbed after all, ” he said, “examples made. ”
White Lines Star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in a apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the recording site of the White Lines, dealing with the suction and shock of the Ibiza, but in the last week's search for houses, their face was another and quieter, far away from the beauty of the party island.

When they announced the divorce in August last year, Clavlin, 34 wrote to Instagram: “I have decided to understand legal divorce; we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and we will continue our cooperation on our children’s education.
In 2011, Laura and Sam first met in a hearing trial, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “unfortunately one of the greatest results of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in the White Lines, she had played in the previous Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from BBC, which was shown earlier, where she played the lawyer of Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners image and in the British Sky rankings.
Counts too early to claim for another wave here in the country
A physician’s pharmaceutical expert says too early to claim the other waves of the paediatric population.
Three new inland meals were reported in the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday and have been decades of suspicion.
Two domestic meals were reported on Thursday, one in a man aged thirty more than the other in a man aged twenty - twenty.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, there were so three additional domestic meat, one of them who had been at the Rey Cup bankrup convention in the Laugardal.
John K. Johannsson, an information agent of the Head of State Police, says in conversation with a news station that less had to be shown because of this infection than was originally considered.
The second is in the case of a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15th.
In that case, rules on the so - called home gate had taken effect.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus’ daughter, a pharmaceutical expert at the National Medicine Office, says that, however, the person concerned the old course.
The vision of him was negative to the land, and then he became sick, in isolation, and six have been put into a punishment.
All of them are on the way to show, but two of them are beginning to show symptoms.
The third infection has then been associated with the older man that was diagnosed on Thursday and has been put into a pathogenic situation.
There has been a new variation of the crown virus that has not been identified in the country before.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we have not seen it before.
He who was considered to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries.
It thinks it is too early to claim that the so - called other waves of the pestilence have taken place in this country, just as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority are still busy, it is not eating that.
But we're on our tears and are watching, minding ways to fail if something like that could happen."
Megan Fox speaks about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin throat in the rappara Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in star signs, and I immediately knew that my double throat was about," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ Two - year - old soul is when the soul has come to a sufficient level of existence that it can divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two helmets of the same soul, I think.
I told him when we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had been familiar with him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the star signs and asked him out in his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly's taking the same string, but they've seen a movie.

She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."

Increased heavyness in protests against race law in the United States
Protestants have walked across the streets of many cities in the United States to raise attention to race law.
Congress has been held for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI to Portland, and thereby still undergoing the objections.
Protestants now also contradict the arrival of the police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, a lawyer used blossoms and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after a protest meeting to support the protests in Portland was released in violence.
According to the police, over 20 police servants were hurt.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into Black Lives Matter's demand.
Media records say that the man could have walked up to a guned rifle before he was shot.
“ The core of the matter is that it is terrible for someone to be killed in protests, ” said Steve Adler, city director Austin, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “hearted and wordless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants required justice in the case of Breonnu Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with a permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
The boyfriend Taylor had first shot to the policemen, for he thought they were inbreaking thieves.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other police have not been sent to charge.
The leadership of the NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more intermediate in the research police on the murder of Taylor.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when the rebellion army shot accidentally.
Possible group infection in sealing
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of them were previously infected with an unprecedented variability of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist that has returned from the country or the symptomatic Icelandic, which is likely to have been more infected.
The local physician says that a possible group infection may be in a sealing connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with the type of the virus.
The source of the infections is still unclean.
Three were then diagnosed by the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of the others diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country last 15 July and was likely to be infected outdoors, but the third is also inflicted with unclean origin.
After analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new variations that have not been identified in the country before.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a pharmaceutical expert, and a physician, says that icelandic genetic analysis is now undergoing where this type of virus is most likely.
“ The other case was similar to a virus that has been ongoing in Switzerland, but not exactly the same.
They are going to look at this and try to map it better and make it possible for us to find out what part of the world's infection comes," she says.
“It seems to be here on the side of the Atlantic.”
Thus, the infections are disconnected from those two who arrived at the beginning of July and were moved to the United States.
Do you think that this new species has come outside rather than being mutated in the country?
“ Yes, this is different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this was something to paint here, ” said Kamilla.
“ The probability is all that these individuals have in some way come into clearance with a person who has recently come outside, without knowing it itself. ”
She says that there is no evidence yet of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ Of course, there may be a traveler who has gone back from the country, but there may also be someone who does not get any symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and then, naturally, more infections could come after.
We'll be on our tears the next days to watch it."
“ Anyone who has arrived has not arrived any smart group infection.
However, there are individuals who have been infected in connection with one of the infections yesterday that have symptoms and have been showing," continues Kamilla.
“ We have not yet come with the results of them.
So that could be a group infection in sealing."
Do you expect this to be a social issue now?
“ It is not excluded.
It has not been past, but it is not excluded because we don't know who has carried this infection in these individuals, which were differentiated on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be possible to mention that here is now starting a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, however, we need to be very careful, and we need to keep this in mind even though there are such limits on what we can take a lot of shows in people.
We don't take a vision of people without symptoms, but first that we are getting a infection that seems to be inconsistent, we need to be given some more free hands by taking a vision from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, in the next few days, the National Hospital Department of Anti-Virus can be expected to give a better map of the position in this country.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the domestic display and to take care of skiing at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some foundation for taking a vision in individuals who are not in the discouragement tasks; the person must be in an injury and show symptoms or then have had symptoms and suspected of getting clear to someone who has recently arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that the infections that were diagnosed yesterday are still underway and that the individuals are now getting information about their journeys.
It says that the origin of the domestic medications seems to be inconsistent, but it does not exclude that some of those who have now been infected can produce evidence that eventually leads the infectious team to the original infections.

Google Pixel 4 can create the galaxy
Double optical zoom enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in three-wide and thus return a better moor in the background with a facial image setting than in the previous pixel phones, which trusted the alphar on the software to achieve these so-called “bokeh” effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, the legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz got up on the scene to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 last 12 months.
Engineering is still in front of all aspects of new smartphones from Google, and in this phone, "computer-controlled photography" is new to improve the HDR+ setting by merging up to nine different images.
New bi-directional descriptive controls offer different slids for brightness and shadow, allowing users to preview HDR+ for real time.
The phone is also angry with a machine study to offer a better automatic white equilibrium and improve the Night Sight night setting, which is so thorough that it can catch the galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to other cameras, Pixel 4 Soli presents the "Radsafe" on the front of the phone that greins Motion Sense movements so that users can release well, disable time measures, set awaker on the blund or turn off the phone's sound by weaving hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are performed in the device instead of connecting to the Internet and the same applies to the improved Google helper, where technology is now highlighting the shortcoming of reaction time and improving user protection.
Continuing emphasis on Google's full use of its computer status has also resulted in a new voice recording app that converts sounds directly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone that supports Google Stadia, a play scene in the cloud that will be released by the stocks of 19 November in the United States, but after the date is reported for Australia.
In addition to a new pixel phone, Google also presented a new pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing chairs.

The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools are completely wireless and adjust the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported updating on its connected Wi-Fi sites in the Nest Wi-Fi line with special bones, together with many basic sites working together to improve a wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest Name, doubles its predecessor and adds to its built-in audio students and speakers to use the Google helper at each base in the home.
It goes for sale in Australia on November 5, and costs 399 Australian dollars for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.

Stang hunter “loved throwing a beer bottle to sale” in Devon
A steep fisherman threw a beer bottle into a sale when interrupting the fishing line, according to a well - being organization.
Photos taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seems to show a man on a rock that throws part towards a animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the gray sale has been hunting when the barfishman emptyed out of a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this “a terrible and unreasonable behavior. ”
He said he was picking up waste at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning, along with other people in the Seal Project Seller Protection Society when he witnessed the attack.
“ The soul tried to get into the hunting line, ” he said.
“ The steep hunter stretched the beer, emptyed the bottle, and cast it into the sale.
“The flesh landed on the back of the sale and he swept away. ”
Kenna said that “the better is to sell a strong - populated animal ” than that the seller would simply have done what would be natural to him.
“ Through throwing a glass bottle into him, you stop him on his hunting, ” he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was “not a unique case” and that it had recently received “many reports of this aggressive behavior.”
In the company's Facebook operation, volunteers collected 12 bags of waste in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of anti-social behavior” had been seen.
All sellers enjoy protection according to the laws of the protection of sales, and people are asked to stay away from them.

I took a few trips up and down the pole, but then I got to beat him, and that was awesome feeling.
Grab my stalk and jump on him.
He measured 102 centimeters, and I doubled him," said a delighted hunter in the hunting cabin in Laxá in Dalen in a conversation with the Covery.

Television reporter thanks to the viewer for the observation of a carcinogenic spray
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — Television News Woman in Florida thanks the observer’s attention for having noticed her neck and sent her an e - mail that she should have checked him.
Victoria Price, a newswoman at WFLA, Tampa, went to these advice and was diagnosed with cancer.

“ The doctor said it was being distributed, but not too much, and we are hoping that this will be my first and last operation, ” she said.
The audience sent Price an e - mail last month and said that the node reminded her of the node she had.
