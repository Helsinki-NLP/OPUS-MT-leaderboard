Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was captured after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bosland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they noticed it as it left a tank station on the Batdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he left the bushland where the officials lost it from their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the description of the driver was later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of neglecting a stop signal and unreasonable driving.
He was to appear before the Court of Justice in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raising a woman at the Scotland Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, slept, and could not signal any consciousness."
Webster is also proposed to have raped a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' law.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-president of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This roadbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops the powers of ancient trade union.
The supplementation of the national labour law to create a possibility of discrimination to organise a trade union representative in order to complain against a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors suggest is the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the reactions which the trade unions have been exposed in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and union law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions took part in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed for union and joint negotiations and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and their voice should be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly said: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed for each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this law are zero and insignificant; targeting measures are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chair of the International Human Rights Commission, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was accepted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect or join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country discussed how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union would then be able to participate in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After these rights have been incurred in America, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so the working people must have the right to unite themselves and to listen in a free and open society.
As pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unprecedented production level.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employees representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America in the past and incorporated the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, who said that it probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June and to enter into force on 1st Septh, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions on a provisional basis while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in law, while seeking to achieve these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing for the judge shall be taken to bring a more persistent decision for the law.
Abortive advocates welcomed the decision that recently took place in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The present decision means that the women in Louisiana are avoiding a violent law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had complained on behalf of three of the five hospitals of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to the doctors from the two hospitals who had not attached to the complaint and also applied for instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries who have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutionally.
Key points of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Aborting advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instruction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abdominal agents oppose the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a physician who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient information rights, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery because of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions while their requests for patient resignation rights were still attached.
Delayed diagnostics and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates of eggstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James set a video home for her mother online, who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in Australia's rural areas there is a higher risk of dying to ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
CLEINE STUDY: New medicines may slow down lung and eggstock cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-sicknesses, as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the diagnostic time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the country, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of eggstock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologens, and these are mostly to be found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services in order to tackle the distances, it proposed to strengthen the service of influential doctors in order to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of the geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in eggstock cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of age, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decreasing household ownership numbers
The reduction in the number of household owners under 35 could result in the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Kernelter Group for Garden Products".
The report suggests that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people spend with home for their garden.
The increase in people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure to asptain gardens for parking purposes and the falling garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated 5 billion pounds per year will be placed on sale.
In London, where over a period of 6 years the share of home owners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the smallest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can't draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garten Advisor for the RHS, said, "Container gardeners are very popular for example in renters because they can take their plants when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of garden retail trade due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from late 1980s to mid-1990s.
He also forecasted a improved market situation for this year due to the better weather under unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, which was referred to by the opposition politicians Imran Khan and the priest Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state broadcaster PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters from PTV buildings again.
The broadcaster sets up its operation for about 40 minutes, but in the meantime sends again.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they provided collisions with safety forces with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators requested Sharif's resignation, but he rejects it.
The army of the country therefore urges a political solution of the conflict to "should waste without time and use without violence".
After a meeting in the mainquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan suggests Prime Minister Sharif to have deceived Parliament's election in May last year.
The protests were escalated in the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to go to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's most servant US diplomas to provide information on a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the U.S. Messenger and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. experts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries spioned each other.
A previous report that the most important secret service of Germany Ankara in the Visier also provided a significantly more annoying reaction from the Turkish government.
Warning: Cloud Leader threatens with consequences for pendlers
On Monday evening, the unbundled warning of the Lokführer could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The exhibition announced for 18-21 a.m. on all transport companies, including the Fern, Regional and S Traffic Traffic;
The main direction of the warning strike is the freight transport.

said the district president of the German Lokomotive Leadership (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting considerable losses.
Regional priorities do not give it.
The main direction of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to see the consequences concretely in advance.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutors submitted proof of depression by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The Chief of the Calvià Police on the Mallorca holiday island was arrested after corruption of businessmen and bar owners in the famous Binge-Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
The main Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online day newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted proof of expression by police officers and employees of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for corruption fighting Mallorcas on Friday.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption claims and are consulted together with Navarro by a judge.
The National Spanish Day Newspaper ABC reported that the angry night club seats said that the veteran economy of the authorities has serious effects on their businesses.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made a viral YouTube video of international battle lines in which an 18-year-old British tourist was showed, full of 24 men during a soft tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholized holidays in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the beneficiaries of alcoholic beverages.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio case took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Knepentour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of 55.000 € (73,000 dollars).
The tourist town Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidays, is also known for some accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of the "Balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with strong sights and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, another 5mm rain fell to the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down to Sunday in the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a number of short, stormy actors, including a guss that started just 20 p.m. and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided a early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of 15.8°C on Monday.
The weather conditions are likely to lead to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m., but it was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windstones reached about 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to start through a second land flight and eventually set up at about 40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible sighters.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
Given the galoppy technical progress that threatens to transform our pleasant home to high-tech castle centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with an extremely confident electronic accessories.
While I write this, my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If the cable wasn't, all listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be much more retro.
Without prejudice to the echotronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world news is the electric scratch of tomorrow, purchased - old.
And, for example, who today has a tube TV in the living room, who simply says that he really rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the urging of the Ifa on the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in electronic matters.
The shop, which was previously dominated by the washing machine and CD players blindly, today does not even consider the purpose of the devices that are spread with unfatherable fragile expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What should we talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quarkers?
Actually, for about 20 years, it has been the most important thing for us to network our house.
So the joghurt itself is resorted so that the firenotifier informs us in vacation on the Maldives that it burns gradely in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly be true to the next time: We raise our armband watch, say, "Sauge!" - and at home the dust-saugroboter runs.
Irre.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown product dimming," actually a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam fgarer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza needs in the oven, but nothing is useful because we stand in the dust.
From the daily practice we also know that when a newmodic device is really used urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israelite children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and murder heritage committees went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools stayed closed in Gaza while the area was recovered from the fighters.
The school start brought the communities in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of battle are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, before meeting the students granate splitter from the walls and shining walls.
"We're a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little strange" to go back to school.
"That were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a gun restoration the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of the border communities, such as Saad, stayed in their houses or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian maursergranate, are still hesitating with the return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Your children were preliminaryly placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city of Gaza, which was hardly drawn by the Palestinian arrival.
He appealed to the children to learn much and said, "We will ensure that your knowledge is acquired and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last Tuesday on an unlimited arms restraint.
The arms rest led to an immediate end of the fights, but important problems remain unresolved, like the demand of Hamas for a lift of the Israeli-Egyptian Blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battle.
A new round of indirect conversations is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of civilians, and at least 494 children according to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contradicts this information and estimates that it is at least half of the killed fighters but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and marble grenades during the battle on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250 000 people searched for a refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary protection rooms.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protection rooms and continue fighting, the educational authorities have moved the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school is opened again soon so that we can learn further, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza city.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedure
In view of the loss of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has spoken for the end of the current NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban on the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landechef in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that rather leads me to the result of fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD has failed to vote on Sunday at the five-percent obstacle.
A first call for a ban on the legal extreme party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also in the NPD sphere of informants.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now placed in tents in the new country place.
The Central First Capture for Refugees in Harburg places out of all nights.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were informed just shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to be reserved by the citizens and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to contribute constructively to the human entrance of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the District Management of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first recording are the crash of applicants - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in subsequent facilities.
Thus, many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
This increase has resulted in the overall increase in June, July and August at 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data show that the home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which has been hard hit by the cuts in state expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that with the beginning of the spring, there would now be an increase in the real estates that are for sale which would be subject to the market "a real test" for the next months.
"If you consider the continuously high rates of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuous low interest environment, it is likely that the home prices will increase further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the Leader of Peer Medau and attests this to position "as a fieldlord".
This is not the style of the university, it is said in the Communication.
So the Medau family was already "in the midst of June orally informed about the sensation of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he refers to the fact that the plans are not "preliminary or even decisions", but to "preferencies".
The development of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus fears.
The street was nine metres wide and is not the talk.
It is about 5.50 meters according to the current position, which is a meter wider than yet," explains Pötzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and educational parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Togeparked is not at all because it can be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Remember the Inhabitants
The children's crisp of Bergwichel, which is located on the ground and which would lead the access to the park deck before their door, is to be "not affected by the university president".
Instead, he says, "that this is not only about the children's screw, but also about the residents at the incoming to the Friedrich Street Street and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
So it is much more than particular interests of the Gentlemen Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the children's crisp's parent council, with the expansion of the road, would be justified to "the few naturally consumed spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide itself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Bauamt, wants to inform the city councils about the construction of the university by 2020, "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the child cripple about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access for the new park cover is not to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Strib streets, but over the Medau mountain.
To make it necessary to expand the narrow road on about a kilometre long two-piece length.
According to the Medu's records, the traffic in the Park of Hohenfels would make it twenty times.
Of about 2000 vehicles daily, the talk is.
The city's sides did not want to express themselves on the project.
Glandorf withdraws from the handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal Legislator SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was mature over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the World Master of 2007 informed on his Facebook page.
Thus, he has a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Since the wurgful backspace player wants to go to Torejagd for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagurdsson.
With the island, which announces its border for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmed me as they will enthusiasm my long-year co-players and my followers.
But I would also like to be healthy available for my club in the next few years, and there are longer periods of regeneration that do not allow the current double load.
The left hands had even to fear his career after a fersen infection in 2012.
He had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortison syringe, which later had caused a strong inflammation.
A emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Glandorf had then announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not go to any body without a trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related feet operations that took place in 2012 in short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
This is why some other pain-related complaints are involved.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can't control my head but my body can't fake," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be ready in absolute emergency.
"If all the sticks are ripped, I'm always ready to speak," the two-fold family father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become quite humble as to my health.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go somehow.
In addition to the WM title 2007 and the profit of the Champions League 2014, he picked the EHF Pokal 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured with Flensburg the Europe pokal of the Pokal winners.
German economy in spring decreased by 0.2 percent
The crises around the globe have braked the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the pre-quartal.
This communicated to the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only consumption lived in the spring, while the investments fell.
The external trade also braked the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual rate, for the first half of the year, a total GDP of 0.8 per cent is compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led the city of Burgmann for the first time on Sunday.
The city of Burgmann Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietsenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Möüste".
It is the largest tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this round through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various journals.
We're from The Hero and we've driven overnight to take part in this round.
We also want to meet the Münsterland in this way," the bike drivers rejoiced the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the Vereinsheim der Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went to a small "friedensfahrt" through the city over the wall, where also the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led back to Horstmar to the Schöpinger Mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Picture Beck.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 metres, 120 km with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 hectares proved their good condition.
They were arranged on their way in Havixbeck and Picture Beck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Representative Heinz Lülfing was very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all participants.
The organization survived without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lülfing draws a positive point of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably on the bad weather forecasts and on the morning rain.
"We see again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," however, the bike drivers promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new post.
Constantine Weckers unleashed honest memories
It is actually more philosophical evidence than biography, which Konstantin Weaker, Songmaker, Passifist, Polite-safe Activist, Ex-Hepling, brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thought feet for thought feet, the coin born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he's unfairly honest: From the Onanie as a gymnasiast to the shop steal and drug use he does not let human weaknesses out.
To show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow people.
Wide space also takes abstract, but the more important terms: love, soul, Ego, His in Now, Spirituality - all of this he trys to go on the basis, in very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his societal criticism, his political engagement - and as he did not only the music (the opera lover became a Soul and Rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Last time, the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker has also drawn closer to the asketic monk, which is "through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving all unnecessary."
Between all the high spirit views, however, there are short anekdotes to the earth: such as over battle operations in a local or whale-witched car journey of GI, where he showed a tree frontal.
Even there, he's unreasonable.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry proclaims for a comodie, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on a imaginary conversation with his father and came from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with live melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" treatments after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just listened to his voice, "Shut up with the scratch.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown when I was a child - went to the knee with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a castle in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's times, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little bright now, but they're dark, smoked, deep fragile labyrinth with flames and smoke and much rust.
My father just put himself in the wool, and then he was slowly heard how he started singing because he was able to wash the castle from himself.
When I lived around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Yet, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we started, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop embarrassing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French with which he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetes.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carotta.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was taken by theater.
It followed the coma of mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and commodities who have filled his working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the middle of the seventy years. "I was the only black imitator/Comedian in the television for a pretty long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only before the public, but also learning from 1975 to 1985 how I could become a efficient Witze story machine while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which people painted themselves "black," Henry launched his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly awarded light pillar of British television" was also a "great-sized parodie of black people."
By introducing figures that the British black culture both spotted and celebrated, Henry worked in the eighths on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went to the shipment in 1984, and in the ninetys, he was known among other things than the Kitchenchef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy series Chief!.
After his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just going to take the time or get a little in place."
Afterwards a series of documents for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was usually allergic.
I had never learned anything about him at school, and I thought it was mostly a domain of the middle class, whites in the pants and a coal head in front of it.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so.
Henry took up 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was excited.
I felt that I could do this.
It was almost like someone would have put my head right.
"That's about it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he came into the coma of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break over 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the pole leader announced that the idea would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a theater piece, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the sights.
This also came well, so it's like a great sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comediate - our conversation has been carried out by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of foreigners is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're driving a wall.
I sometimes appear live in the Apollo, if I like to do so, but totally there's not as much for me as before.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up competitor again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actress.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebells block streets in Jemens capital
In the conflict between Shiti rebels and the Jemenian government, the Huthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi attachers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenite media report a transport chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, according to the sheet, his claims should not be fulfilled.
The Shitian Huthis struggle for more independence from the sintly governed Jemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The national tribe of the Huthi has been camping the Jemenite capital for almost two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access paths of Sanaa.
In the country around, there are always bloody fights with the Jemenite army.
Kenia registers officials to "resident employees"
Kenya has started to register all officials biometrically in order to remove "geist employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid were a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive wage payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700.000 £) per month was lost in payments for "residents" and other mistreated financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials now have to appear in identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been reported in a government message.
Those who would not do this without a credible excuse were removed from the wage list.
"By this approach, significantly contributes to rationalisation of the public service by detecting the actual number of officials and also purifying the pay list at both government levels - so the "geist employees" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal around the art consultant Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before court on November 11th.
Five inheritances of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Gründer Theo Albrecht, demand in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19,4 million Euro damage compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency procedures.
That told a court speaker on Monday.
The complaint says that Achenbach deceived the purchase of artworks and old-time hours and computed Berthold Albrecht higher prices than actually paid.
This would also result in the agreed provision.
Achenbach has purchased value items for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was at school in 44 years, 23 of whom as school leader.
From this time, Manfred Judger knows many standing Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always weared by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain of the giant mountain.
Manfred Judge loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trauutenau/Nordbohemia, today Trutnov.
When he was 14 years old, he was interested in the Teacher's occupation after four years.
One year later, the Sudetenduts were disfellowshipped.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern - in the freight wagon in 1946.
Thus, the judge swallowed into the Oberfränkische Senkendorf.
The teacher education took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Judger had to go to the next railway station six times a week, traveling to Bamberg, going three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Judger received a sleeping area in a red-creuz home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he took the first and 1954 after three years of teaching officials the second state exam.
Since he had no place of teacher, Oberfranks went to Oberbayern and came to Collbach school on 1 November 1954.
The "Froulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he included a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Collbach in 1968.
Until that time there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69, these were gathered in Petershausen at the present council.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the place.
To avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to the modern building, which was extended in 1997 after Judges' pensionation.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of Ludwig Götz’s Mayor, who, on the other hand, made a work room for the community and for the enlargement of 1997, to build cellar rooms, even though this was not eligible for school building directives.
"Burgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," the judge recalled grateful.
During his career Manfred Judger never forgot the speech of a government representative who had answered to a referral of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love." Manfred Judge converted what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "That doesn't always work." Whether he only meant his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students were crushed, they did not get a criminal work and were not condemned as a refuge.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box gloves and let the two contradictors approach each other, even if there should be a whale.
For the sake of the school, judges maintained a good relationship with the Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the parteilos Judge after its retirement to submit at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the municipality council.
But judges were elected at place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers put in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Scots Intermediate stops
When cyclists make rice on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is not special at themselves.
On Friday, however, only the number of racing impressions made: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and Begleittross enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and experienced a concert of Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists attacked the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continue to shoot.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Citizen Champion Hans-Peter Seum, which was started in Bad Vilbel with the bike, and the leader of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things were prepared: The countrywives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, twist, jewelry and cheese cooks that were wonderfully mouthed the cyclists.
"Some cakes can only back farmwomen," praised a participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
In the beverage of the Gitt Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could be produced.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the visitors with known melodies from operetts and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambient of the park worked relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved, finally he has re-fixed out-of-the-art bicycle chains."
Consequently, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well before the Trink House of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also, promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 as a tour manager, could only sniff a short while he had a lot to do with the technology on the site.
His pickup truck, in which he wrote Facebook entries and made reportages with his employees and the 15-headed motorcycle truck of the police Hessen, wrote and made reportages, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or fulla, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westfalen are bicycle riders.
The number of participants is somewhat adjusted to the overnight capacity available.
In Category I, the participants are included in hotels, in category II in collection accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression from the courage when they again broke up after one and a half hours, "Beak!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they whinked for awesome.
After arrival in Schotten, the group was allowed to put a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were demanded in the idyllical Alteburg Park.
Under the government of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, it had been prepared to make fun, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather white.
Citizen Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach in his function as CEO of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were obviously pleased about the "many operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporty operation on the bike, the opportunity to move under free sky was zealously used.
Between the guests were increasingly mixed citizens who had been affected by the good mood as the great scars of the wheelchairs.
On the second day, for the bike drivers, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of bicycles, the sportsmen met back in Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Totally 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they claimed to have founded an organized criminal association and picked up telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) described her course as part of the activities carried out by the Islamist clergy Fethola Gullen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school leader in Slawjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive education that will be useful for them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wear covered shirts, keep balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It takes place with a proud roaming drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back when the highest position of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male colleague.
Their finding claimed to be nearly 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was a consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
I already described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup in May.
Not only stands the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as the voice of public concern and disturbance when things run wrong.
This ensures a almost unsustainable duopol, which demands a complete reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk to enter into everything and to separate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be bringing himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it weren't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overcome.
While competition is closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the ongoing negotiation of licence fees for BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public is purchased into the definitely largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pences per day.
And apparently the BBC rises up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent before 10 years ago.
The view and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news on my mobile phone today and see missing programs on my iPlayer later.
But she remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the republikan governor of Texas, Rick Perry, held a decreasing comment on the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of official violence.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account that dismisses the previous one.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
The employees of Perry did not answer immediately on requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet, a disproportionate picture was drawn by the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was condemned in April 2013 for drinking at tax.
Perry put a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which could lead to a charge against Perry - which may be a presidency candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I complain to governor Perry when he pours it out."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was carried by Michael McCrum, a special lawyer from San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-class team of judicial courts applied for the judge to reject the accusation and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffus.
Perry stopped 7,5 million dollars of government money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - which is resident in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to enter back.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidateship in 2012 as a fifth, Perry went into speculations that he would stop by posting a twitter of a picture of himself when jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley again declares the home market as "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the home market in the southeast of England was "reversed" to normal level.
Homes in the capital were warmly desired and the subject of huge price increases, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a loan blast, proved to set limits for hypothecillary credits in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-quality construction company Berkeley said: "The market has returned to normal transaction level since the maximum level of 2013 since the current financial year" and added that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the departure, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the catastrophe office, prices in the city area alone have increased by 18.5 per cent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, price-value and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and amounted to 423.000 pounds at the end of April.
In recent months, however, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been absurd by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetorics for a possible "vill tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate maker Foxton warned last week that the hypothesis market report for April, in which sharper credit grant schemes were presented, would lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and at prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the hypothesis authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis of a already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has decreased by a quarter per year, says the distributor WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts for the sale of an appointment amount up to more than 2,2 billion £.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the sales of dates have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - nearly one third more than the maximum of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre tax result increased by 40 per cent annually to 280 million pounds, turnover by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be expected to meet the current market expectations for the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-skatte result to 450 million £.
In the afternoon, Berkeley acts were fixed at 23,96 pounds in the London trade.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar award.
Naked photos of the Oscar Prizemaker Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of more than 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "equivalent injury of the privacy".
The authorities were notified and will persecute all those who forward the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were reported to be created by a gap in the iCloud of Apple's online storage system. The claimed "masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I have taken in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so really satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" declines that the pictures of her are dealing with and twisted "These so-called naked pictures of me are GEFELSCH, people.
Let's just reject the beginnings.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande dismissed the authenticity of the claimed photos from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's high-proof new novel about love and the letter "J".
They crushed, so you could best describe it, they slowly solved up like a carton that you have left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strangerous, intense, distant, and maybe a bit of scratch.
And then shake his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was stupid, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stiffness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for relief the lonely longing of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon was a crushingly delicate beauty with untucked hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more distant and harder than port reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompanying, who thought that she had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the vivid name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, in the bathrooms there were still spines, necksnacks had left their tracks on all windows and believed that they were all of this, and the garden was overwhelmed with unclean, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a child marrow, both threatening and attracting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn on the broken lounge chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been attended to the service consoles that provided the country with calm music and sensing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer who would have listened to his father in closed rollers at home.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their original aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so right forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what the adoption and regulations had never managed, and as people in books choose from the tower-teller-to-milionary memoirs, cooking books and love romans, then they chose the balladen in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play a imaginary piano and sing in a huge-comic Serenade Ailinn’s big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song of a Jazzpianist named Fat Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without put two fingers over your lips, it takes you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game at that time, and it was not very funny now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard who.
Jazz, even if he was not directly forbidden, wasn't played.
Improving was no longer modern.
It was only space for one "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be very sure where they would end.
Likewise the sense.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed sense.
Though he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz about the half secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably couldn't remember a time in which Popsängers were not black.
Again, no laws or forces.
A conform society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thankful as they were saved from the destiny.
People with afro-Caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sport by temperament and body building, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as of nature and were responsible for the task to ensure that no family remained without a working service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community was careful for the channelization; what remained of the Greeks crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WHAT WHEN, WHEN THE COMMUNITY WHAT happened- out of fear to be accused of fire, even of fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeifen restorants, kept in mind and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his capabilities.
As she had only heard Balladen, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the misunderstanding words that Kevern had just sing for her could ever be consumed.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the huge coal-style leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
After all, she thought he was something weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shake her head unbelievably and locked her throat sight.
There was nothing else to see in the world than her uncovered ribbon black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
They seemed very worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw again.
You don't have your feet right now.
Maybe your knees, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knocks are too thick?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick knocks are exactly the reason you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be strange, he often put himself in trouble because he, like his father, did not have the calm charm that was needed to condemn the cruelness in his heart.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and raised out of her chair, threw the console and shed the wine they had drowned.
Holunderblomsy wine, so drinking was not apologize for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to scratch like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary inconvenience of his words and the fear that was shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would hit them?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same giant and ice-scalled ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more devourable after WHAT WHEN WHEN been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, pulled from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or murdered them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch!
They only knocked - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-toxicity to the non-saying love balladen from the console - they first knocked and then hit.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the cnutting itself was already a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the mourning of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She looked at him as he distant - as from a room in the upper floor, her companion watched him - a man, complained by something he himself had sworn up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, scared, defeated, without battle spirit - why was this a sight she seemed well to know if she couldn't remember once she had seen something like this before today?
When she was back alone, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Several years prior to the recent events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher worked on the order of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, on a brief lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been expected to be the best, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to facilitate the inborn aggression of a people, leading thousand wars, and most of them have won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness has been seen historically despite the highly demanding church towers between the hooks rarely.
But some qualities are unreasonable.
The higher the churchorm, it seems, the less passion it continues to wake up.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental balladen, is exposed to stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the deeds of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps rural communities as well as our urban areas firmly in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and persistent dispute in the home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme nussboom lowered her head.
I also have to ask you, are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme answered Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme called upon her right to privacy and denying the statement.
Feminine?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a non-profit workplace.
We serve a non-profit society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things you mention as "reasonable" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as the expression of natural force and vitality.
If you continue to move around, WHAT IS THE HEALTH, WHAT IS THE HEAT, as if if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential vital viability.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the year or more.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to balladen, visit Musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, excuse.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to go beyond," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been healed as effective as we pretend to ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may recognise how we repeat the mistakes that were only to the fact that it was, WHAT it was done.
This time, however, it's not the others that we leave out of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
To indicate that an English throat.
"You go too far," he said, "if you mention actions as "fails" which our grandparents may have done or not.
They also go too far if you say that they would have left their "worn" and their "mistrust" on "other".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, like protecting the present, we are not talking about "ons" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one that, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good done what happened has happened.
That was then.
We don't have to be told anymore - we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be allocated, no guilt must also be dealt with if such a refuge would be appropriate and if there would be a way to devour them.
But what does the past mean if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to forget it.
If I can say something about it,
Luther Rabinowitz fell together with his pyramid.
"I'll remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, as passengers described, had driven on the footway in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says that no State is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state struggle for the disaster of the government and said they were acting against police officers who are being petitioned to be armed by political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane flew out of the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded his office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the adjacent South Africa after reporting of attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it de facto did not give a state line, but the military responded to the threat of "political fanaticians" whose armed by the police.
"What happened today tomorrow that the Staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after having received several secret service reports that within the police acted some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just in the past to cause devastating damage," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of a crash.
"Even if nobody claimed to have ruined the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have yet demonstrated signs of a state stroke," he said.
Talkers of the Military of Lesotho informed on Sunday that the soldiers were moving back in their casernes and the situation in the capital is quiet.
In the meantime, the Viceptremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government management during Thabane's absence.
Thabane informed that he believed that he was to become a target disk because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Thabane had postponed Parliament's sessions due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said that his actions wouldn't have undermined the government, otherwise blaming accusations to the defence.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down at the lowest point in the last 13 months, such a precisely observed study.
The final market Shopping Manager index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, according to a position of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a timely increase in tensions between the EU and Russia across Ukraine.
The figures shall take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for the management of a delayed recovery of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Governor of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether it considers a quantitative enlightenment for the Eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"But a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more clear for producers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner in Russia in the EU, fell at the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth in the key industry mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer calming," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely to cut the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economy Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchase manager index of the producing industry in the Eurozone is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are currently finding life quite difficult, since the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly impaired the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some contracts are delayed or even cancelled, especially large contracts.
He said that it is "an ever more probable" that the ECB must finally initiate a type of QE, "because we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: 10 years have passed since the terrible occupation of the school, as the children there are still suffering.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people of Czech milits were taken as hostages in a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of these children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had lost the death of the crueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible settlement of the Beslan School, where 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night against a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of the wicked one.
The tragedy united west and east into awe, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst distress.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had lost death at the crueltat in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Her greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children like they die - finds a end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian Star Photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried in her underwear to climb back into the broken school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was totally confused looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier made her safe.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be operated again.
Some granate splitters are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says championous.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I'll always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the settlement will always remain a part of it, although the memory will become a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophes, and contribute to doing something like this not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russen is going to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day camping in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me I should lay down when there was an explosion, and keep her hand."
After a explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear, they could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying little kid, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullshit.
His father, Vladimir, who locked his son out, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was stuck outside and with bone injuries in the hospital, on its own, in assuming that her son had died.
After her reconciliation, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and bumped me.
This was later flying to London (from the now dissolved news of the World), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop memorizing," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be blessed in my memory.
I remember that right afterwards I threw all my toy guns away.
But now I can play computer games with shots and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children with whom I played in the court and who have not done it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I very well remember my journey to London, especially at the play shop, where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in an up-open car.
But now he fears the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I'm so sorry for all those suffering among the griefs," said Damir, who worked as volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me next year at the school.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the settlement, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence took many months.
She lively recalls her journey to London with Damir.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation thankful for the price and the possibility of traveling to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damier and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Burschtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he was playing with cellars in a restaurant and thus shot with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still being killed.
These are just like our kids.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are tired or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
So that's great and is a very softer and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last greeds.
I know that he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and inflammate there candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turning our face down for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. This is now 17, larger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with all around the body parts.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I heard him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he walked away.
And that's how life goes for us, different from many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the camping became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the camping 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarian of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a physician, had put him off for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is no one day in which we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean it's happened yesterday, some scenes of these days are always pursuing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intendingly: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was forever as a statue (right).
I remember that this day Georgij wanted to go to school so much, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him in the TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the books.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we've ever learned the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedy and never learning the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
We need a dozen years to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the settlement, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when the 1st September moves closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friend tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at feet of a murdered terrorist during the settlement, but he managed to survive.
During the settlement, he was captured in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go as a secret service officer to the FSB, but could not do this because of his health damage due to camping.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt something better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost the consciousness.
I'm never going to return there again and ask me not to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after laptop camping
My pain is incredible and I'll wear him every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can go well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medicals, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never report my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this, and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary goes closer.
I'll go to the festivals to the memorial.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's difficult to accept this if something so unfair is going to happen.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate for his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the campsite and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the biggest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the murdered.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
What do these people fight for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe that.
We were formerly a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If we could only take and throw out all these rebels as far as possible.

The baby that has been carried in security by a special input command
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special input command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the griefs at all
In 2004, the world stopped breathing when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's settlement.
The terrorists let them go, but in her grief, her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar left in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonah’s mother and sister died in the murderous mix.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana that he has called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the settlement and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that raise up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make pictures or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most valuable option is a water density point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Independently, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other ventilators are closely closed.
Put your camera into the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scenario and recording modes which optimize the exposure time for the damned underwater conditions.
And before you jump into, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only authorised for up to 5 feet, other up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping leader and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-shot cameras have an LCD that can compose images with, Action cameras usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to look at this under water, and the right image setting is a happiness thing.
So you're doing a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode, with which a series of recordings are made with easily modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface if you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on the country, but it is more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is very important if you work with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed white angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a adviser, he devoted his career to save both the agony of the disease and the illness of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to diagnostics and diseases, while the treated people are mainly busy with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble raising myself.
While fighting with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatiently contempted.
"I prefer everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out a X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer that attacks the chestfell, that is, the skin of the lungs.
Like most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which once was considered "wonderable" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore as easily.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, but the industry voluntarily committed to not to use it anymore.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain industries were working directly with the fabric - climbing, building workers, room workers and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly to be anxious today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, experiences today the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we experience the fatal effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 has been prohibited all asbestos types), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the mesotheliom's goat is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos insured.
Also in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, as the starting shepherd of this fatal carcinogen has already been made.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a climb.
Indeed, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I graduated my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pfurtners - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my agemates will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partly.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who were ill in Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
This was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio signs die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still get sick?"
The leading expert in the United Kingdom at Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestospidemia in Great Britain is expected to occur, 90,000 of the disease will be victimized.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief view of the acts of the courts to which the parties concerned often refer for claims on damage replacement shows how far the mesotheliom’s goat is already spread.
For example, in June this year, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Janice Allen was insanely exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenty.
"From this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestos", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe risolations, boile dissolations, even for braking facilities in cars.
It is less fatal than other asbestos forms, but it is considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with a possible death sequence.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "the clear but indirect suggestions that this was a key reason for the unique high mesotheliom rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom offering, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is nevertheless unusual.
He presented a study of stakeholders in which it shows that "a significant proportion of the mesotheliome was probably caused by work or by asbestos contact in the environment without a known postponement."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could go out of being sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been in the heart of the government, uncertainly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service stores and pipelines behind the committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibres could be triggered by something as harmless as "star air movements".
Parliament's members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliament’s Labour Service claimed that the Westminsterpalast had received a "super health certificate", it is now inconsistent that 1 billion £ of work needs to be put up over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections of 2015, the members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "asbest's presence was not managed in accordance with the respective provisions."
Nobody can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general mediciner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaint was positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old, and he had an operation just late evening.
Suddenly, I had shake frog.
It came very suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I didn't make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chest, the skin around his lungs were affected.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Wondered doctors made X-rays of his breast and put Pleurakathether in order to remove liquid from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now, this was not linked to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition was again worsened, and his home physician brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to a expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a sink equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breasthole.
I'm a optimistic.
I'm usually going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week, "You told me it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbot had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably rather not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from a building to another in footway tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground candyes (as Graham abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances with the greatest probability.
It shows that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls due to its fantastic isolating and flaming properties.
Even schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
On websites the theme Asbest is now often discussed in schools.
And then, innocent items in our houses such as footground plates or drawers have standard asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that fell into an affected woman was the departure of a garden ship in the 1970s.
So watch how to cut off your garden shoes.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable, are enormous.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to the one patient.
As many patients before him, he reminds him of how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to accomplish.
"It was very difficult to take all that," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I won't experience any other Christmas.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly incredible because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smaller fibres.
When the asbestos is turned up and the fibers are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who probably had been exposed asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos can reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
Of nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The usual options in other cancer disorders do not work well in mesotheliom.
For example, the efficacy of a surgery is severely controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure declines that.
"You can't cut out the chestful," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because the cancer says "not very well on chemotherapy," which "effect shows," but not healing.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Happyly, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a single-man support and consultancy office for fellow people four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he imagined happy when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and expected to extend his life only for one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, created "to make things appear in a little more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage by not having to be rejected, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom-sick to take the best available treatments.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many people are concerned with another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s, it was realized that a very low burden also constituted a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally attached their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full-quality compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to a asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation about his death, however, a speaker of Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove Asbest
In fact, for Mesotheliom-sick people who are seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this year there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom stakeholders to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a 350 million £ fund supported by the insurance industry for all diagnostics after July 2012 to prove a contact but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court could have said to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesothelioms that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time wouldn't have gone over and Mesotheliom-sick people find the companies and they could normally complain.
Mike Penning, Minister of Work and Pension, also admitted that the law is "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of seven death victims, there is a need for rapid action every day.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years with long-Lazdunski.
Abbott felt strong.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see that again and again in patients.
There's something that lets you go.
If you give up, you're getting very worse.
In March 2012, Graham Abbott undertook the operation.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
No signs of the disease showed post-care scans.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flakes around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Abbott was again undergoing six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very difficult.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 and Tamsin, 14 is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very social and inconsistent.
She told her friends, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more retaining.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to do.
But for Mesothelio-marked people, such conversations are not carried out by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) a cruel security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong Right to Government elections, demonstrators swear recompensation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong elections.
This approach is likely to fire the long - announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists had the planning and mobilisation to do so within a few hours after the admission.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking faithful candidates.
"It won't be unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control over Hong Kong, Peking has promised to let the inhabitants choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct election right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership maintains the end of a closely controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be authorised "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most publicly effective protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Ocupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general election law.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of occupy-Central attachers had gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the admission.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further information in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication the organisers informed that the movement "the occupation of the central district has only considered as the last fund, an action that will only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and it was the Sunday before the government building that worsened security measures including police forces and barricades.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The growth of people from the continent strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy-Central movement, as they threatened the business of the Hong Kong life-ader.
"The protests of which they speak could cause major economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they persist," said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum to the election rights that 780.000 people participated in - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of the school closure balls in the United States is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen appearances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are glad to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain to students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also claimed that the service had a security sponsor.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to climb their habits in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company speaker said that no new bookings were made since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "studios would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of 9000 pounds per year, it would expect a market for this offer.
Students today are very different from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as deprived.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for High Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start the study this month are exposed to a crisis of life-keeping costs, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and grants do not take steps with the strongly rising invoices for the simplest living bases before they can at all remember spending thousands of pounds for as simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. in the beginning of this month.
The participants put their hands in the air and sang, "Don't shoot up," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shoots of 9 August, personal essays came relatively late with titles like "Thinking to Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women".
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you find many people who are about the white and speak privileges in such a high-quality way," she said.
People felt urged to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson raised problems with black American women every day, but not considered as "women themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colory in their own country is under captivity, the silence of ears is deep.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect to the topics of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 100,000 black men were polluted and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the fight for the election law could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply for the women's election law, and the right of choice for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remind yourself of such things, you will be aware with power of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the election law in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came up nearly 40 years after the original request for help from the pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - is a mirror of time in which white feminists played "fangs" with the problems with which black women have seized themselves since generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to train a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who build their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to anticipating resources are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a risk inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender homes are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are surprising.
Christina Summers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stolte Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "wide more harmful than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the front of the mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up almost 63,000 unmarried minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform will also come back to the surface - this time as a female theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, an organisation that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for reconsidering the topic as a major female topic, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work shows on male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position in which they are appealing to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a afterhall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweet house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate makers, as it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had bedd his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was unfairly published and was now removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exposure of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the maker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of houses provided interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is a new millionaire after lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey is in this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues with a happy winner who gets almost 1.1 million dollars from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaperskiosk in Harvey took the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, a suitable conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had achieved the Mega gain of 7,5 million dollars only a few weeks earlier.
The winner couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the profit permits them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionary from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the gladiators stood deep in the math on the first Rheinbach Roman day in the leisure park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors last night, who defended the rain showers and the herbly cold, and left themselves unhappyly excited by the historical spectacle.
There was a lot of presentations, shows, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial battle force from the Gladiator School of Amor Mortis, which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the soft sand prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men into the ring to the heroous two struggle in various gladiator gates.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle signs and short swords and legs on the left leg and armpiece on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breastchild, short sword and wormflance, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which, with a casting network, three bag and a dolch, took place against the "Secutor" and after a short fight, stuck the bones to the ground.
Since the swords were metalically connected, the shields created and the wurfflanches fled surrounded by the arena that a fear and anxiety could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on the one, the impressed "Summa Rudis", the Musculous Judge, had a constantly remarkable eye.
"We wanted to resurrect the Roman everyday and make the culture of the Roman time experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the event "Friendskreis Roma channel", the intentation behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Opidum Romanum", a Roman city was found from the leisure park for one day, as Vice-Claus Wehage found in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest into our region but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of these were also admired by the Roman day, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the 11 metres high and 1400 metres long Roman channel bridge, which was at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once presented the water and energy supply, and now, manager Petra Fricke knew, "We still benefit from the knowledge of then."
This also confirms Diplom Measurement Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "ingenieur teamTwee" of Rheinbach, who presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented skies and models of the excavations atno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressively the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Grounddenkmalpflege at Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
Constitutional walls of an economic building have been found with a darre for drying cereals and for mealing.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of findings from these excavations presented it in a glass vitro, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a terrible necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the Roman Rhineland then suspected Morscheiser.
In addition, with her, the children worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to the modern furniture game, or they wrote their names on wax tables like the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Roman therms Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bastle at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and to use a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the Nature Centre Eifel Netersheim to mail the meal for a flock or a müsli.
With the original compulsory Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and came over the impressive state of the city's gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Romans Project Weeks".
With a week of Romans from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Watchberg will also import into the Roman Year 2014, which is intended to remember the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations, and the Watchberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the League-Spielkreis Oberbachem are offered, among other things, a themetic hike, a lecture, a cooking evening, and guides for school classes, and remembering the Roman past of Watchberg.
For example, a Roman Legionary is told of his work on the Watchberg, presenting plants as living monuments from Roman time and offering a fun time of teaching in matters of international understanding between a group of Watchberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
Adendorf's basic school is devoted to the Roman theme in a week of project.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Watchberg are to be experienced again.
At the Watchberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remember the foundation of the Berkum Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is burdensome for the Western African economy
The Ebola epidemic in Western Africa is also a severe struggle for the economy.
Markets are perpetrated - and international companies go on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major struggle for the Western African economy.
The harvest is rooted on the fields that are left mines and the markets are wasted - the virus has been hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic crisis," judges the Head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been the hardest hit by the virus, here alone, more than 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was in any corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands more were on.
External companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are exercising their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group Arcelor Mittal are deducting their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying the affected regions.
Also the local dealers and farmers react: Only few buyers leave their homes to get a refuge.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cacao and coffee beans that are important for exporting are on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food Gets Known
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris Expert for the Western African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables is preferable to stay home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food will be short.
On the markets, the stocks will disappear basic nutrients such as rice.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region of international companies threatens image damage - with profound consequences.
The greatest risk is that international companies are principally avoiding the area over a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French thought Tank Iris.
Determining how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
In the case of investors, the impression is that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the strap-adhesive state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are strongly absorbed by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with EUR 60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are also evident in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the south of Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
However, elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly falling.
Protect your 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau is celebrating his 50-year foundation feast from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the Preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September will be carried out at the Danish Forest.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, the big ball shooting is at 18 p.m.
Afterwards, in the large festival of the mood evening with the "Stoppfälzer Spitzbaum".
Blaskapelle cares for the music
The peaks on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 p.m. in the church and the great festival at 14:00 p.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndlns.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The screen rulership has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Foracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when the Association for "Societal Entertainment" was founded on 21 March by exercise in room studios and small calibrations.
The NS regime had led to the resolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, which had lifted the "new" protective association "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism on April 30 in the hospital of Luke.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a guardian champion through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the protective association started in the guesthouse "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports guards, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes to the first Gauliga.
The association records pursued every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the numbers of members have also developed positively.
After the association site "Leiner" has no longer satisfied the demands of a modern protective association, then the board under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Harteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, priest Strasser for the new protective rooms awarded the church blessings on 8 May 1988.
One of the major highlights in the history of the United Nations was certainly the 44th gaushot, associated with the celebration of the new guard flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the protective association celebrated his 30-year birthday.
In 1995, a böller group was founded.
Joseph Schmalzl became a Böller-referent.
A major challenge for the "Ballers" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerian Baller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honourable work, the association members have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competition
The sports performances of the protective association can also be seen.
Totally, eleven teams are currently participating in round competitions: six air weapons, a air pistol crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen from the Gauoberliga (highest League in Schützengau ANB) to the districtsliga 1 in 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga north to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sports, events such as bocksticks, faschings and kingsball, association excursion and Christmas tradition have.
With this, the guards are also at the festivals in priesthood and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race
Tony Stewart's return to the race ended about halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time after his right front strip was placed around 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car to the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focus on race in Richmond, Virginia, next weekend.
"I wish we had had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart used to run on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to make the right side of his car repair.
"I've come in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the slepper and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met another driver at a ashway race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which had entered on the road during a race to face stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart must expect a complaint.
The three times champion was received with a great applause when it was presented before race.
After a start at 12 position, Stewart was shortly pressed into the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After restart in round 122, run bushs
Wagons with no. 18 excluded control after the exit of curve 2 and collided with stewart, both cars driven against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to position 21.
Dancing joyful descendants searched for
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to fellow struggles.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV make Jahn the full-day education at the further schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now there is a stronger search for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two Jazz and Modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more actives, the whole would be much more fun, "you could dance quite other choreographys," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can break up between 17 and 18 p.m. or Friday between 17 and 18.30 p.m. at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without binding into the training hours.
"The training starts regularly with a warming program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographys are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from Folklore from classic to sport and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the community is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've been overnight in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motoric development.
Who isn't such a jazztanz, he can also incline in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always get into the lesson in the fields of child dance/jazztance, Bambini-Ballett, video clip dancing and hip-hop in the lesson.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Whoever wants Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can look and join.
Bulgarian prison overseers protest countrywide
Hundreds of prison workers from all Bulgaria have organized a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the recovery of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have protested symbolically against the new working hours for a month and demand a return to the previous 24-hour layers.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported no agreement.
The negotiations persist, the Director-General for the implementation of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov, notified to the BNR.
The protest of the prisoner's employees is expected to be supported by members of the Federation's Association of Employees of the Interior Ministry.
Ukrainian army has left Luhansk Airport
In Eastern Russia, the prorussian fighters continue to be on the formarch.
After serious fights, which were reported to have been involved in Russian Panzerbataillone, the Ukrainian Army gave up today, Monday, the airport of Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the grave defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the highest army leadership without calling details.
Prorussian separatists shot a plane off
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have once again shot a battle plane and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donezk region, according to the U.S.A. on Monday, Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships reduced
In addition, the reconciliation claimed that two boats of the Ukrainian coastal guard had been lowered for the first time in the Asian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of its ships were shipped on Sunday near the port town of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the Sender 112 ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
Separatists reported that they had controlled several localities in the Donezk area.
Diplomatic Opening in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets today.
In addition to the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the Separatists from Eastern Russia should also participate in it.
In advance, all players used their appearances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
The NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
On Monday in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the NATO was adhering to the 1997 NATO Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO Chamber accused Russia of "a crushed breakthrough" of the agreement.
"Today we have to see the reality in mind that Russia does not view the NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and comments from the Russian side, "that they view us as opposers".
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that they want to strengthen the NATO praise in Eastern Europe.
A "Readience Action Plan" to decide at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas conversations
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas disputes.
The negotiations were launched for the next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union whether it also sends a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has been getting no more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, from which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will "come quite clear"
Now, the bureaucracy becomes aware of this again.
But a free letter for all complicated details is not.
Hearty concerns from the CDU against the truck wall have eviled the CSU.
According to persistent oppositions from her CDU, Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car wall.
"To say it clearly, she is in the coalition contract, and she will come," said the Head of Party on Monday after meetings of the CDU-Spitzengreams in Berlin.
But a detailed model was not fixed at first.
In the black-red government programme, "specified parameters" are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being continued to work on it".
However, the NRW CDU persists on its no to a wall right on all streets.
Merkel stressed that also Minister for Finance Wolfgang Schueble (CDU) is constructively engaged in the discussions for a draft legislation.
In addition, he talked with Dobrindt about more possibilities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Scheuble had left a "speaker" report uncommented on Sunday, his house checking a own concept to compensate for motorway investors with wall income - after the election of 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned about developing Maut concepts against the executive minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed to support all circuit and federal roads," said the Nordrhein-West-Falish CDU President.
This is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the topic.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landing Associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background is fear that a wall affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded for the wall criticism of series of CDU coalition series.
The left views the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as failing.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party manager Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German streets to start in 2016.
Inland autoowners, however, may not be charged additionally by coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the wall via the Kfz tax.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British says she thought as a result of a misdiagnose for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that harm the nerves outside of the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK announced that failure diagnostics are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motoric disorders such as muscle weakness, uncertain walks and crowned teeth.
Diseases also suffer from feelings of deafness or pain. The disease is unhappy and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad survival opportunities.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 years old and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said, "As a child I knew that I couldn't do the same as the others.
I always fell down and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride with the other kids Rollshoe or Skateboard and I was often arrested in school because of my kind.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several surgeries to eliminate their axills and stretch her feet, she saw her illness acts when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received a reply, I was shocked and scared in panic.
I thought I'd be 18 in the wheelchair and die with 25, and then slowly all my skills would lose.
I made this all alone with me and planted my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she realized that her skills had not declined as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
Following some genetic tests, CMTs were detected.
"When he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closing of the former troop exercise site
For nearly ten years, at the former troop exercise site in Munsingen is no longer shot.
Yet, every month, deadly ammunition appears in the heartpiece of the Biosphere area Schwebische Alb.
Sometimes the granates are still so dangerous that they need to be sprayed on site.
A ear-deafened knall halls over the heartpiece of the biosphere area at the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen troop exercise site, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area is the core piece of the Biosphere area Swabic Alb, which is opened on 13 roads for hikers and bicyclers.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington's room increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax statements for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in the room of Washington did not constitute an exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $27.6 billion to government and local bodies in the financial year 2013, an increase by 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9 per cent a year before, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 per cent, according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 percent, come from company taxes, while 36 percent of Marylands revenues come from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, says researchers, which resulted in an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these gains came from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the departure seems to occur for the Washington room.
Businesses in the district, Maryland and Virginia collected over $10 billion to government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over a year by $4.2 per cent.
However, the apparent recovery of the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue, as the real estate taxes amount to nearly one fifth of the tax statements of companies.
Company in Virginia and D.C. pays almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, the manager of the Centre on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies can not only be allocated to the recovery of the real estate market
It also appears to be recovered, such as data.
Company in the region reported income taxes in government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in business income tax, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not increase equally in all three places.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia, with 6 per cent in all three official areas, has the most significantly low income taxes on enterprises (in all three there are fixed rates of company tax).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A comparable study by the US tradekammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, government and local business taxes are required and there is a better tax climate in general than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will decrease to 5 per cent in the coming year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small enterprises in the Washington room, and therefore they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than the total company taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, Washington's room could hang behind if the federal government's shortage of expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Partnerstadt: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hope and paint - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
Deutsche Bier, broke in Frankfurt's Partnerstadt Guangzhou - so is the urgency of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would leave in our city," said the Vice-Parteise Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion on this issue of the Twelve-Million Mettropoles, the functionary of China's governing Communist Party came back.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, wasb Li.
Hence, people also possess the purchase force to provide German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German Political Delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and life-joy," he added to the lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines Mr. Li, he flirted to the host.
The functioner from Guangzhou joined the guangzhou with a shear rubber, but with red wine served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German bride art.
Tsingtao-Bier is broken according to the German purity command.
More commercial services
A second wish from the Chinese hosts would be a flight-driven connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The airhansa had offered the flight before, but deleted for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would reward again," the local politician became convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to increase."
At present, travelers would have to take the turn over Changsha in Hunan Province, complained Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
Chen Yunxian, Vice-Guver of the Province, raised this wish in his discussion with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," shepherd-Gumbel answered - the Chinese Vice-President Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nicked.
Consulted Partnership
Guangzhou's fine Vize party hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the office for corruption claims.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against Guangzhou functioners is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is carried out by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is very unusual in China's Communist Party.
Before his arrival in Guangzhou, he was working as a top-functionary in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW builds a great work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those who are cared for from both sides, such as with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the South Chinese metropole at the Perl River is almost as strong as the whole Hessen.
In the next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "presss the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago in a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today has hopefully shown that the 81-year-old comic is recovered from her disease.
"Thank you for your persistent love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pressing the thumbs.
According to her mother's sources, on Thursday after an emergency due to heart rest in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors will deliberately keep them sedated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is continued to be described as "earst".
The reactions came from many sites, including in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental vacuum cleaner and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from now on, more stringent environmental standards apply to the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1 September will receive a label on which the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the "Euro 6" category, sharper nitrogen oxides are applied.
In addition, there are more money for the noise builders: they receive a bond-wide uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected an overtake of Twitch, but because it was far assumed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to the Google video service for a cool billion thing, and cooperation appeared, of course.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which better awareness gives the (most older) games a mark of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was somewhat tired, a lecture book example of a established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, as the company reportedly was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we currently know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community that they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly said, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports rather than to see it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that goes out of seeing others while playing instead of taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over the shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning, whilst she's slept by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinner with how he's being shot 20 times in the head of Call of Duty.
All these games could you just look at now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the view can be a really good recipe for headaches without its own control over the perspective.
I confess that the fast loops in which the Roger Bannisters of our Electronic Age are graduating all games in record time are entertainable.
But as long as a game or humor virus is not there, his switch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being murdered as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "be both believe in the future of the gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking, not even - suck - as a viewer sport.
On the hipburg at the Burggarten festival, something was done on the Sunday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the strong rainstorm on Saturday evening, estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
Time had to stop the entrance.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saladle in light and fun.
In two Spanish words, Maxim Sakraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is to exhibit brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday when the first visitors opened the open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they did it.
Salzwedel, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings, had been cosy about the supply sites in the castle garden.
They pursued the first live appearances, wippled with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were decorated.
And that crosses the generations.
While the one on the decks on the extra carved white sand numb on the beach bar, others laughed on a quarter of wine in Vinothek, the after-growing on the hipburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But the volunteers in the realest sense of the word also had to make all the hands full to become the Lord of the Andrang and to wipe fantasy creatures into the small faces.
The largers used the Kickertics or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew from Saltedel was arranged.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17:30 a.m., he praised the visitors, especially families searched for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt this.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "think on the whole line".
Therefore, a repetition of the great party will not be opposed in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the people's voice.
As an indignant, he said that the invasion had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result was that some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox discontinued its appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to saltedel because of a tyre pane.
"They will be there next year," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be carried out at the first time, but must be removed in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have, unfortunately, taken over you a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very close.
I think it is very good that some are not only stupid, but also really trying to put something on their legs.
"Did off!" says Stephanie Jens to the Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to set out these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's observance shrinks
It's not expected to be like that.
Instead, the constituent part is ready to be used in the marked construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the TIRA space monitoring radar has been established, the cover, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be a little smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
But the size remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new hole is the tape exchange
The upper quarter of the old hole is separated and taken with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new hole is set up.
If the weather is playing, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice-Bucket Challenge crowns herself
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shouted so much as her ice-called water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket chalenge went painfully along.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she ran out the cage.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circulated so much as her ice-called water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did, my bowl remained simple," she said to the Mirror.
Ice water is shaken over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the bowl was abandoned, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and made themselves almost in the pockets before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency recording.
The 20-year-olds from Great Britain were sent to the hospital in order to get back to the cage after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensor and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle associations going to get back to a strike?
Lastly, there was always twist between the two Wolfratshauser Burgenvereinen.
Now the boards think of possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfriende, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle association and the Wolfratshausen.
As far as it seemed, the views of how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction seemed different.
Now, the two camps are moving together: discussions about a common approach will soon be conducted.
This confirms the associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on the demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could put ourselves together once," says Sjöberg.
His view is that all members of both associations could be retrospected in the future.
Thus, quicker visible successes are to be shown.
While the castle friends around the sudden died Richard Dimbath had a rebuilding of the castle at the mountain forest in the eyes, for the castle association around Sjöberg, the "development and experience" of the terrain is the first place.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of Castle Friends, has been very pleased according to its own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been standing for the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
At the moment, the association, according to the 74-year-old, counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have first let the association activities rest from respect." This "denk phase" had been needed to "consider how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the castle association.
Until that time, the castle friends could also make a current picture of the atmosphere within their grouping.
A candidate for the chair is not yet there, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find." He does not want to admit himself because he has his seat in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much on working".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He honours Dimbath as "Missionar", who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
They are a tourist magnet by high participation in the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive the project forward. It could be created a "all-up setting" feature for the river town.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be fundable through EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally don't want to simply throw the idea of reconstruction on board." He hopes that the castle association may move something in this point.
Their goal of documenting history is "important and good".
Then you could keep on seeing.
Clever ways to save at Uni lecture books
Since the cost of university learning books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-two-two-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart spade.
He found a lease system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for 10 dollars for a semester and a chick file-A-cake," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college leader informed that the student averaged more than $200 per year for teaching books and study material, however, there were various cost-dempting options for the students.
Online tracks and creative approaches such as the screws are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
The rent of teaching books becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester long, often at a significantly cheaper price than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university books, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college books last spring semester, Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in campus books according to the trade association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are to have in the campus book store.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, however, can be included in the specialized teacher Chegg.com for 239,99 $.
Buy Used
If the notes of other or normal use tracks do not matter, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have Chegg.com for 93.49 $.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at the Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditure were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the latest expenditure costs.
Without Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting teaching books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, think of giving them back and you do not want to keep the books after the course has ended.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that apply for writing notes, subscriptions or use tracks.
Careful: If you don't return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books are also an option instead of conventional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are rent de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of large dealers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
In Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded free today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look around, at least.
Joe Gault, 29, who will next visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price provision for books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before a online order, you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually prerogative.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book store.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only took $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" that was cut to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's movies such as "Drachenzähne" 2 also disappointed in income.
An article from the telegraph critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the children's films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films itself.
Collin referred to in 2014 as "the worst year" for children's movies and described "Drachenzähne leicht made 2" as pure "functional" fantasy continued.
However, in films for a little older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema seekers and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of the last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing sight habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon appearing jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times change."
We need to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix in recent times achieved sales with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which turnover amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused too much on comics films and prophesied a "core-smelting" Hollywoods.
In the light of the present rehearsal, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy can contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash fighters expected in the summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of kassen results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinema box at all, and nobody will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd Tischtennis district class was deleted for the punishment of the League division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Federal League into the programme.
The result: Whoever hasn't risen is declined.
Thus, Göttingen's highest team of Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the decline, but only five-class plays in the coming season.
Four-class torpedo ladies stay in the region, despite their grand doormarch.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Wedding.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve join in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga are no Göttinger Clubs anymore represented.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo district in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Leadings, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the districtsliga play as a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC turn, in the district class of TTC II, red-white, the Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district soberliga of the ladies begins at least in sound strength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here from the party.
In the district liga, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen runs up.
With the nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district.
Also the districtsliga staffel of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Wede and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded region association, the two Göttinger starts circularly with every nine teams.
In the West Staffel, the Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen und SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel plays, among other things, sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and landolfshausen.
The Queen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemlen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wedding and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Easterode circle, where there are no more women teams at circuit level.
Attention that none of the six second-crisis classes will have to achieve sound strength, here will the innovative and radical circuit board have to think once.
Nato Summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
In the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall in order to hold a so - called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed us the developments in the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers fled out of the Blue Mountains
THAT young Buschanders were put in security with the seal winds after they were caught the night into the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Around 20 p.m., the police called when the two weren't returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the pair was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 p.m.
The girl had hurt himself on the knee and the man had crashed and had kicked his head.
Rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were fled out on Monday tomorrow.
They were supplied in a stable condition with a hospital in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalate government enemy protests in Pakistan
The about 1,000 demonstrations were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister for Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a half hour, the broadcaster resumed the radiation.
The PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrations equipped with bars had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
Demonstrants demand the resignation of the Head of Government which they propose election fraud.
The police informed that about a mile from the residency of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come back to conflicts of about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
A policeman was injured after hospital records.
In the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrations tried to move to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called on a political solution to the conflict, "to waste without time and use without violence".
The Communication also stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The escalating violence harassed an interference of the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests made by the opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have taken place since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif rejects a rejection.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to return," said Khan.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan suggests Sharif to have won Parliament's election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and province governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
First, the demonstrations had persisted peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them up for Sharif's residence in the weekend.
Huteldorfer after the second season seat on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 about Grödig, for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday took a reconciliable end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the out in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschützen Steffen Hofmann, who stood on place three with green white.
Schrammel-Trumtor brings Rapid to the victory road Rapid showed the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki at the second season and goes with a success experience into the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defended Thomas Schrammel, who, with his glorious leadership volley from the sixteen corner in the 14th minute, put the softness on the victory.
"I thought I had all the fruit of Thursday and cut it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit the last time in a federal League party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship meeting in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid afternoon," said Schrammel.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term basin blesser, the scratch pushed from the left to the right defensive side and made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position incorrectly.
The gate he deserved, he has already done some assistants here," praised Barisic.
The team shows Character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour that finally brought the decision.
Because it would have been possible to register the guests.
"Thank God, we have had some happiness today," also noted sharply, who played on the breakdown of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playlist was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before was better than today" against "the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium".
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team's resignations were intact to the defence: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Not less happy for him, "It's finally we've played to zero."
A lot of work during country play break Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were complaining about several outcomes, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-elfdebüts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," reminded Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which were very stable in the past."
The country play breaks must therefore be used to swallow the wounds and to add a bit in the physical field,” Barisic explained, who has five U21 selection actors in his series.
One who seems to be specially located in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's crushed for the crew, he's going over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic observed.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who graduated his 350th Federal League game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We have probably also had a little happiness, but at any time the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He freely urged to concentrate on: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the past weeks as it was represented.
But we can't believe that everything is good now.
The importance of his role for the team he couldn't defend.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They're in some phases to me," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to introduce himself and his team.
He regreted the quick contradictor "from the category of magic", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which had been unfairly admitted by the Vice-President Colllegger.
The only objection I can make to the crew is that we weren't concrete enough in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Inside defense Maximilian Karner saw it like that: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In general, more would have been in there.

We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine Happiness" on Friday last.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the pictured copy is the "gate rusteiche" above the underweight brown.
A hollow walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It's over with groups, basalt stones and Basalt stones.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surroundings and reminds with a range of more than eight meters of an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a wooden stomach indicates that it is a spiritual or mystic place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only evidence of the origin of name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishopsheimer archive and asked older people from underwhiting brown to learn what familiarity it has with the giant rest.
The result of his investigations remained the rightly naked declaration of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the bovine shepherds should have driven their animals from underweight brown from the mobly rooted and freed from stones.
At the feet of the tree, the sufficient animal guards should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance, because on the wheat, goat shepherds are actually reared.
The area has also been declared to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, and Schneider has further discovered.
However, when you enter the stone collections, you should be guarded of caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crustards.
A walking road leads from underweight brown to the tree, but is something hidden.
Further paths are depicted, the direction of the highhead rises and invites to an expanded hike.
Where is the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is searched for at our next task, is rarely in the height.
The mirror in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have in the district some historic buildings to which the building conterfei could fit.
Where is our "Stuck of Rhine Happiness"?

After weeks of diving, Italian Prime Minister and Vice-President of the European Union, Matteo Renzi, held strong conservative opposition at the EU Special Summit last week, the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, will be followed by the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how La Repubblica’s nearly governmental newspaper reflects, the calling of Mogherini, also in the government team, as a favourite, as a strengthening of the position of the socialists and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left base that he wants again, because Mogherini is assigned to it - even more in a modest way -.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome is to produce a political compensation.
Because the EU Chief Diplomatin will be the chairman of the Commission President Juncker at the same time.
The still outstanding agreement of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, state president Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year politicians of the governing Democratic Party (PD) as a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, known for its ambition, has proved to be the "enormal challenges" for almost two decades.
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began the promovated police in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Links Democrats), which joined the Catholic Centrum Party Margherita in 2008 to today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
By the choice of 2001 in the Left Democratic Party Council, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose leader was soon becomeing it.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO intervention in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved in a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Members in which she is expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became premier in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with strong peace movements in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD cruises, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The reconciliation in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, i.e. lacking from substance, is concentrated in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, the mistrust realistic accent Mogherinis is persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and diffamated as "Russian-friendly course".
It advocates the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe, which also serves by Italy's energy security.
After Renzi entered his term of office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for its first national visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the Shake Hand were taken in Brussels with contemplation, as well as inviting the Creml Chamber for October to a mailing economic summit.
Totally nine young people started their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi which has previously completed another training in the company.
The new employees are active in four training professions in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronic (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bookl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Free Careful and Sebastian Zahner from Pfrimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously visited primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the students go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day migration and rafting on the Inn programme.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of students to be distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep the mouth and make France okay," said the most important allies of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply split left to show "their love" to the controversial socialist president whose cabinet environment has fought for disappointment in the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everybody's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
As a provoking gesture, the Prime Minister claimed that its government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite severe demands for a relief to the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "unified" with the government.
However, Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spread sand into the drive, where she appeared at a meeting of a deceptive socialist member and criticized the socialist party for taking the French "the faith in her future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculated the constant socialist grave fights and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would endure more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one nor, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she would be confident to be able to make choices as a victory and be ready to the government.
France's dominant party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the judicial national front was at the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the socialist party is exposed to the danger of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the period of office Holland 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a policy scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion $
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider of the world, leads, according to experts of the industry, advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruise International Inc for about 3 billion dollars.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as its prosperous customership, while competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could end without result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruises on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige cruises, also located in Miami, operate under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which share eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cross-border industry is totally around $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to be for them due to the strengthening of the middle class in threshold countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice in the crossgoing providers.
Prestige cruises applied to the US Regulatory Authorities for the exchange in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group grew near the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted on Sunday a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional democrats to be authorised to choose and lead pro-democratic activists to observe their threat and to lamb Hong Kong's financial place with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's presidency over Hong Kong was presented in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum to the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched in the business district of the city and organized a seat in it.
Lis survey is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Office in Hong Kong.
The vice-president of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-President of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headquarters office.
The United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands by Kiev the inclusion of 'state talks' with Eastern ukraine
The Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government would engage in fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly negotiating the "statity" of the devastating region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the region of the Eastern Russia under the control of the Separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine should be re-defined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiefer Government for negotiations at an eye-height with the Pro-Russian Sustainers, however, matches the strategy which it seems to have been pursued since the start of the excursions five months ago: aid for the separatists to take areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija to be independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reover the areas held by separateists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had announced the Ukrainian Peninsula Krim on 18 March.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently called the intake area "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the prerevolutionary glowing time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separateists, hope to be "catted in their illusions", itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start promptly detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of South-Easternukraine in order to maintain the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to statelines should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiefer leadership for months to distinguish fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Creml speaker for the correction of the "Felinterpretation" of Putin's comments underlined Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct announcement of the Crime, on which the majority of the two million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow had far greater difficulties in declineing the Donezk and Luhansk regions in Eastern Russia, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict resulted in a wide majority for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomas on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give Kreml de facto the control of an area that connects the Russian state with the Crime.
The five months ago announced peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian marine as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow area in Russia and the Krim are also rich in mines, factories and guitaries, which produce important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the introduction of offices, suggested that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take account of additions to the Constitution, with which the respective areas are given greater control over their finance and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Creml and the separatist rebels whose arms and rebellion Moscow are being proposed.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye height, followed after a further demand of the rebels last week after Russian troops and pancers have entered into the former peaceful region along the Asian sea to Eastern Russia.
The Separatists supported by Russia took over in the army, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Krim, the control of Novoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been in place to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500 000 inhabitants, which is between Novoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for acts to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are standing just before a point where there is no back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign pancers are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership required the draft further sanctions against Russia, which were to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian pancer columns and 1,000 soldiers ended in the Donezk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, included by the Russian attack in Ilowajsk, were probably exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian fallscreen hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, shared Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photoscandal about Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a hole about his trouble over hacker who probably stole naked pictures of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A Promise from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking candal about promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this has probably 60 photos of Lawrence, stars of "the tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were reported to be made public because of a iCloud close.
The list contains 101 promises.
The noblest who had been engaged in Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the moment in New York, reported by a news site that the hack was "injurious" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which it is located at the top without a pool.
Palmers' film works include "Liebe is unquestionable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It is a terrible injury of privacy."
The actress Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
Purely legally, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th wheels on the Great Field Mountain and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour for which one was a torture represented a light training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberursel Brauhause was riding on the fieldberg yesterday.
For good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat there, especially as his participation on the 8th wheels on the Great Field Mountain in favour of the Association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - well!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Ursel City parliament, many of the 718 participants in the early tour came to mountains and came near the fatigue but happy on the Plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the nearly 11 kilometers long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The very red green politicians from the circuit day - red dress, red bike - made at the start something more on understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), then the mountain proved to be half professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a roast, as well as Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two Triathlets, the "Feldberg Radels" wasn't necessarily a sports challenge: "This is charity, we'd like to go with it - a exit we would have done nowhere today," said Kuhn.
On their way, they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to the top of the sun in the morning to be strayed back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swinged home at 9 o'clock at the seat, "made" the fieldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was also fun with "Frith-Toni".
For the chief of the oberursel Cultkiosks, cycling tours over the fieldberg are simply included.
He had been in the 40 minutes with his 6,5-kilometer racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's a "ambitioned racing wheeller".
He must be, too, because he was on his way with the Fixie wheel, although it is also racing wheels, but without switching...
The fact that without a wheel it went leaking up, not only the 20 hikers that rose up over the white wall and the fogstone to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car strip with weight behind a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who was equipped with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for security, said: "The one knows" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special trail, only that he holds the slid itself." So the man is certainly his own slid dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent in groups on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers loose.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the Association "Radles on the Great Feldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participants a beautiful trip.
For the next year he hopes that it will succeed in locking the route to the fieldberg up to the security of the participants.
