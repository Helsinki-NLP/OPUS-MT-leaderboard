Barack Obama receives the Peace Nobel Prize as the fourth president
The American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the peace nobel price here as the fourth president of the US in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The chief of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Nordic Metropole and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
After that, the president's couple planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony where Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the US, but only as the third one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House already declared that Obama will speak about the Afghanistan war when the price is taken.
The President does not want to avoid this topic because he knows that he accepts the price as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened the efforts of war a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to highlight any of his critics.
In the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for pleasant purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific qualitative work.
The event programme will then provide a bankett with the President and his wife, where, except Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning of the price.
He suggested, for example, that he feels that he does not deserve the price completely.
He repeatedly repeatedly that it is not only the price for him, especially for those seeking the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this is "requirement to action" for him.
Natural guards are accused of pressing
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the civil association "Natural protection community Leitmeritz" for expression.
In a number of cases, he has invoked calls against some construction procedures last year, and for the withdrawal of his professions he called for money from the investors for his benefit, said the Leitmeritz politician, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and it threatens him a prison penalty of up to three years.
The sort trash containers in Brünn do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the drink packs, in the southern towns you will find the sorting waste containers again on steps and steps.
And in Brünn?
There you would need to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable trash tones.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But it seems to me whether the Councillords are insufficient to take care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially through the amount of waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the centre to remove, for example, the PET bottles in a collection cart?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found up to now is the pitch toward the hit Gans.
Mr. Unterka is not supposed to angry us with his colleagues, but I do not think so much.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not also in other parts of honey.
Therefore, all of my friends do not prefer to sort the waste.
Of foolishness.
Because it is too far to the waste tones.
I don't wonder.
Even after the celebration I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I haven't seen any colour garbage tones in the vicinity.
Happyly, I came to the right place when I went to the road.
But the waste was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetic probably leaves the brothers of socialists cold.
Instead of buying some waste tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after I was looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-COM society, Brünn is really the worst in the entire district of Southern Virginia.
The "Paroubek" Budget has taken the money for pensions and healthcare money
After the left party has given more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money available in the budget for pensions, healthcare and building savings.
But not for government debt interests nor for international court disputes.
This causes the more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the socialists and Communists have carried out the increase in wages for some groups, they expected that the government pays the money for the sensitive expenditure, pensions or the healthcare money. "This is just a suspension of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans are almost increasingly paid for higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at any time.
Too much to choose where to take from, the state bank is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of the government are not reduced, taxes shall be increased.
For all those who the left party now gave more money: the fire war, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
For the pensions or the hospital money of which accounts have disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid of getting this money.
But for the prize that the state is still more debt - the next year, the state fund will not only lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will increase as faster as well as the costs and interest rates.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT or to reduce the maternity money, as the government did in its counterdeficit package.
Due to the money-deployment of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing in the next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
This is mainly the sections obtained in the competition that can no longer be reproduced and possiblely reimbursed.
Get at most, which is not free of charge.
This means relocation or setting of thirty large buildings, threatened is also the European gold creation, warns the speaker of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ activist divisions with which the State is owner of Majority, and then the money will be eliminated into the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of the dividends is never safe and it is not in any case an infinite source.
In the previous year, CEZ flowed 18 billion into the budget.
Annually, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by the EU rules to the Nieveau from 5.7 per cent GDP.
But this does not end the carneval of the transformations yet.
Almost three billion decreased the budget for various compensation for victims of Communism and crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without that money is not sure.
That's just a gambling.
If we lose an international judicial dispute, we must pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save the money or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-million-year-old project "the State Bank", which is intended to allow the monitoring of the on-line, for what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the financial minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case penalties come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans are expecting for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans submitted appear promising.
It is enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in a few seconds in switching Android.
This is exactly what the American Society wants to imagine VMware, which focuses on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles at the same time on the mobile phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and working profiles.
Both will work parallelly, declared Srinivas Krishnamurti by the company VMware at the interview for the Magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualisation of the smart phones is not a fifction.
VMware successfully carried out the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM storage, on which parallelly the systems mentioned were running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full.
The company VMware is now working together with the European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and to the customer to come with the devices within 2012.
Snow deficiencies on the mountains causing the hotel owner
Scneeless pists are not only worried about the giant mountains.
The missing snow also shocks the people from ordering the ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still receive free rooms in giant mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People are going through the offers, fixing the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask us whether we think that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Anyone who wants the silvester stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers the saving and when the quality of the stay comes to second place, he can try to wait a few days.
In the meantime, the spindelmill owners offer only weekly stays for the silvesterday.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they must give up, and go in at shorter times.
And then the free rooms will swim quickly, appreciated Jandura.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the Ingtours Travel Office, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvesterday in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are fewer free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in giant mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pists are cut off within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reversely and something better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We're about five percent better than the previous year.
On the silver day and on Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the silvester stays, the Omnia Hotel is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
Well, this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent, was a great surprise.
A little weaker is in the meantime of February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the giant mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow shaking.
On Thursday it should cool off and if it comes to rainfall, it should be on the mountains of snow.
But afterwards, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost queer with which student pursuit Barack Obama, the President, with his reputation of the most clever, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question that he himself considered to be the most condemned.
When he finally swept out his desired Afghanistan doctrine, it showed that he wrote these about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he uses the speaking type "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without shaking.
He himself criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq suffered by the civil war - as "unreliable and in its follow-up caratrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on the recommendations of the military, was the only possible and very successful one that is no longer speaking in the news about Iraq today.
This did not improve the call of Bush, because objectively he left his follower a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the troop quota, he again asked the military, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, hard criticized the devastating protectors in the White House.
He asked 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to better.
The President hesitated three months, but has not come to a better idea and so he has deceived the general about 10 000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he initially calculated at least 10 000.
The highest problem in the entire Obama Strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-up will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the war of brothers in recent years, the Iraq society is quite well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only light buildings behind which the patriarchal family relations will continue to grow.
Interest balance between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the insight of the situations that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "dealtable state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama Strategy promoted by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "Frühheimkehr" can create a miracle here, only a real romantic soul that is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date of departure of the troops is pure responsibility because the Taliban will take it as the indirect consciousness of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is to be disadvantaged.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hinduchus Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased penalties do not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question for the United States is whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America goes to Obama for the victory of Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only comforter for Barack Obama is the fact that still three years until the presidential election, and thus it remains enough time for him to reach another strategy, it would prove to be a total failure.
The manager of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receives premium bonuses in bar
The leaders of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in bar this year.
This has announced the company who responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but they may only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Agency Reuters, is thus at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the JPMorgan Society, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he supplemented.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after she had set up for the first three quarters of this year almost $17 billion for premium bonus.
The total amount of the premium bonus during this year will probably exceed $20 billion, despite the measure presented today, after the Agency Reuters.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hotest political topic in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, the United Kingdom reported that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared for France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prizes in all fields, except in physics.
Today, five record women in Stockholm have taken the Nobel Prizes from the King of Sweden, Carl XVI. Gustaf, the Nobel Prizes in this year in the category and for literature.
Besides the four scientists, the German writer was Romanian departure, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the Chromoson area.
The price for chemistry has received the Israelite Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for explanation of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Lauritin forgave the Nobel Prize for Economy that the Americans Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which there was no nobel price in this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao has taken away this price for research in the glass fibre area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prizes has received the diploma, the Nobel Medail and the certificate of the acquisition of the money price.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several priceholders in each category, the money price is divided into them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognized the controveries of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and also stands at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for fighting world peace, even if the price is high for it.
Minister Janota considers the return. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes on Friday early the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who reflects on his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the parliamentary assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the etat deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President-in-Office, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
About his further stay in his function, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law that now receives Claus to signing, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
Parliament, however, voted on the left party proposals for money conversion on Wednesday and increased the money for the officials, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to cover the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the judicial party on the other side, there has been a sharp internal political dispute, which raises the question of the further work of the fishermen cabinet on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in spring.
Criteria claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of savings measures carried out by the fisheries government in the autumn, which, after its understanding, will end the government debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to do so, today, when discussing with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have long ignored the "earthful problem", which is the "inconsistent deficit" of public finances.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus between political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is no longer working.
Premier Fischer mentioned similar words in the editorial editorial as "starch expressions".
The CSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek words that the etat deficit was cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The people's party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unhappy" of the world shows a lot of the country of its struggle and victory, despite some critics, that the main role was occupied by an American actress.
The story tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The unfortunate fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of the American Oscar chess player, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the one and ninety-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
A further important role takes Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The two-seven-seven-year actress, who had received the price for his role in Eastwood-Drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box, already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, which has become a slave holder, a fictional president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Allmight", but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important for many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded with the peace noble price.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unhappy", and at the same time it is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film describes a true event where Nelson Mandela joined his powers with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree with the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racial and economically divided by apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree to the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises up to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role as close to this as possible reality, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actress said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at evening and be behind the cults before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have detected when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon represents the film François Pienaar, captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actress said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard backby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I clinged to the door ring that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual examples, he has received positive reviews under the leadership of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unhappy" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, gathered his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well-exported film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
Light secret resolved over Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry granted only yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested beyond the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian Generality as well as the premier, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on the site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as a "Raket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This already 13th attempt, survived normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, technical damage has occurred on the rocket.
The engine probably exploded at the third level of rocket.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitrij Donski, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the departure from the U-Boot.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern routes was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
Generality has been conservated this time and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were also damaged at the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the leadership of the Defence Ministry only considers six out of thirteen unfinished.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and then it is continued to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even bear up to ten hypersound athletes with a total weight of not more than 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defendant Vjaceslav Fetisov is represented in a professional eishockey game with 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow out in the emergency, and probably already joins Petersburg on Fridaysduel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSK.
After Denis Kulia's injury, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of these who can raise the morality of other players, leader Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional eishockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Storm Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford with a fifty-fifty years and has been able to benefit from 15 meetings and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful eishockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medal, seven world championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup over his head twice in Detroit-Dress.
He has been a member of the Eishockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai left the trade unions. All overtimes are lifted
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Facility Hyundai agreed with the trade union on the cancellation of all overtimes.
Due to frequently ordered overtimes, the trade union announced the stress willingness on Monday.
That confirmed the speaker of the Hyundai Automobile Facility, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday story this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtimes were proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The employees will also receive them in the afternoon for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement, or they can take replacement leave for it on December 28 and so extend Christmas holidays, Vanek launched.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday team are paid the driving money and lunch.
In order to ensure that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point in terms of claims and complaints of trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtimes for December.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced until last week to work 2 over hours nearly every day after the eighth-hour layer.
From the signature of the agreement, the trade union's stress will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
On Wednesday, the trade union leader, Petr Kochar, said that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the claims and sign a common document, they are willing to cancel the stress willingness.
The location in the automotive factory was at the last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees suddenly struggled for constant overtimes.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and claimed shacans.
The management argued that employees had to make overtimes to comply with the needs of automotive cars.
The trade unions also demanded in their Monday Streikberry's call that the employees who had interrupted production during the previous Wednesday would not be sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are demanding to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand this year the fee of 5000 kroner.
The Nosovice Automobile Facility Hyundai is now working 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company last November.
Until this September, around 80 000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200.000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘steeled’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds to interfere with the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact overwhelms the disadvantage that the compound on normal virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicinal products.
AIDS disease cannot be healed yet.
However, the patient can prolong the composition of medicines and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole number of side effects.
Incomplete oppression of virus growth also results in the development of resistant viruses against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalokarborane work on the proteins responsible for the increase in the HIV virus.
The metalokarboranes are compounds of drill, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus growth in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists have come to new improved compounds that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalokarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile caves consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and combined by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Intelligent and persistent virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease diversion of HIV virus would not result in mature infectious virus particles.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also disable the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report, published by the Institute for Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of caves (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which will then be systematically further modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease is tested in the reagent glass, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of Metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique efficacy mechanism, as well as its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and potential for further chemical designs, makes the Metalokarboranians interesting links for further research aimed at the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of Sciences Academy.
ODS went on to fishermen who fights
The President of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS called the President of Ministers as a "powerful expression".
It is claimed to be time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cab with support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is no longer working.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it is the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is his remaining office with the help of the links of Parliament.
The approach of ODS and Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrally different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget,which is more than 12 billion crowns with Linkpartei amendments.
Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has in this regard opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to cover the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should operate with a residue of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisorium.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a feeling of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his withdrawal in the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota has registered to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he considers his remaining in the office.
This is why he disappoints the budget.
The extent to which fishermen are speaking for the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominants of the Social Democracy (CSSD) who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those that concern healthcare and pensions or the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not fail
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministeries people are sitting in a vice-president function, admitting to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to avoid the fight against the deficit heights of public finance, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they are based on the left majority currently in Parliament."
Then he claims that he cannot expect the support and tolerance of citizens' democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if this will be up to date, I will work on it, Mr Defence Minister Martin Bartak said to the Journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer fled afternoon at the European Council's meeting in Brussels.
The ODS came back on the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the members of the citizens' democrats for the acceptance of the budget.
We do not appear to be a child of prostitute, we are not a young child, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pressed back at the political negotiation of the budget by the absence of the Chairman of the Party in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
Even when I abandoned the mandate, I knew that in the next months, especially about the Bolshewization of Parliament and the destruction of all, Topolanek himself reacted.
Following the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway) less trains will run for approximately the same driving price.
The Czech railway ends or restricts some less loaded fast and local trains from 13 December, but other connections are strengthened.
The entire transport volume is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new driving plan compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer driving tariffs are not amended.
For example, several connectors in the capital receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway sets for this route trains of the type Pendolino.
The Quick Train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also be driven on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), totally by eight percent, to an increase in Prague and surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and, on a few days a week, the operation of some fast trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
Among the largest changes, the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice to Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the fifteenth road of the pre-location system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distances to the capital will end at the destination of Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD runs more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Summerpery/Jesenic will run in two hours' distance.
With the Pendolino, the passengers have not been able to drive to Bratislava since December 13th.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The rapid routes are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totally the railway will receive four billion crowns for the next year, as this year. The local trains provide the districts, totally paying eight billion crowns for it in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional routes are 200 million Czech crowns expensive.
For the local and high-speed trains, the railway has refined a ten-year contract until now, the contract has always been completed only for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken to increase the price of the large majority of the licences.
Changes can only be made in single-day network licences CD Net and in cheap Internet driving licences eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven stick until now it was united for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine Millitante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante now kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some basic schools and their teachers.
This has indicated the Agency AFP, which originally informed only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children who were arrested were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
==References====External links==
Approximately 19 millitantes claimed to use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiating leaders are now trying to release the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded vengeances between the two local family clubs.
In the south of the Philippines, in the Province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, with 57 people killed, was obliged to stand.
30 journalists were among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which were associated with the election in the governor office.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the impressive Ampatuan clan was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim Separatists are also active.
But they have reopened the peace negotiations with the philosophy government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood comes into the American cinema "Invictus: the Unhappy", which includes a part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world famous fighter against the apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been claimed to have been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
When the movie starts, the reactions of critics and the public are also sound.
Nelson Mandela
The name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar prize, then in 1993, together with the Klerk, the Peace Nobel Prize.
He was elected to the President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the movie because it comes into the cinema in a time in which in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the world championship culminate, while the media shake the world public with anxiety news about the rising race hats and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black dominant majority.
According to the news Agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are mainly positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new movie.
Of this role, I have made many years and I have well prepared for it.
Meeting Nelson Mandela also personally so that, as I say, I could receive his energy, he took up the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can learn about Mandela's personality and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he supplemented.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united, portrays the South African human rights prosecutor within its first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives through the film to bring together two races and for year and day mutually bounded population groups, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes part in his role in the South African National Rugbydress to the World Cupfield, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of racing in the dress, which is almost as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations for fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby championship may accompany people to join a single people again, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa improves, that will be shown first.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interviews for LN of the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In the louny area, transformators burn for several 10 million crowns
In the morning, the fire broke out at the transformator of the company Ceps in the switching system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district fire Usti nad Labem, Luke Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - shoes and special waste materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer incursion.
Nobody was injured, the Havarie threatened the safety of the management system according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated to several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will be reported only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new, according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps' society has not done anything similar, mistakes of this kind are rare, supplemented it.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the speaker of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the Trafostation, the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps is operated in the Czech territory as a single operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and guideline with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal prosecution against three directors of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises punishment indications because of deceit against three social-democratic leaders.
Contrary to Michal Hasek from the district of Southern Virginia, Radko Martinek from Pardubice district and the leader of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute Inteview in the radiojournal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the rosens, we have only submitted the offer to the extent as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
That's how nothing else remains to us than to resist us.
Due to this disappointment of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all areas that they have taken their steps in accordance with Europe law.
That is why we prepare a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the investigation of the penalties for the further continuation of the Jancura Medialshow, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that in this case it will be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the field of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantage of the district.
He said to the radiojournal that he interrupted the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue after a new year.
He precised that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts had agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech railway and had no tenders for the order in a high 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such behavior is lawless and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he threatened, according to Jancura, also a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not fail to lose the bus licences.
He imagined himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, his name I don't say, said Jancura to the radiojournal today.
Impact against Pneumococs free and voluntary
Immigration against pneumococs changes the custom from January to January.
It is supposed to be free and voluntary for the families as the first.
But now votes are reported that the obligation vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococs culminate.
The Medicine Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay health insurance.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccines for August children free
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against Pneumococks, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Those who have started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay further recovery vaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families sent their children to vaccinate against pneumococcos.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the latest children.
In general, experts estimate that the health insurance is spending 300 000 to 450 000 kroner per year for the vaccine doses.
However, they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 5000,000 per year for all surface vaccinations of children.
The obligation vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococs cause median ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
With Pneumococco infections, we die in hospitals each year after study up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococcos was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be required in the future.
From January this is to be paid by the insurance and voluntary.
That the obligation vaccination would be better, e.g. the Head of the Civil Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association has been long-term for pneumococco vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with the voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to carry out at least this.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky started.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococs.
At this moment we don't consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claims the doctors.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical children's doctors, Hana Cabrnogova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has their disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then you might think about the reduction of the repeat vaccine number "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was started as voluntary," says Cabrnonova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococs from the next year.
The vaccination against pneumococs is also in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by the sickness insurance and not by the state.
Insurances should spend the money for prevention, so they save for further treatment, delighted Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern for the practical children’s doctors relating to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that the insurance could "extract the money from the hospital insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy and wait for the vaccines themselves until the insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, each practical doctor will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy at all, says Cabrnogova.
U.S. artist's son is involved in "museum thief steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings at the value of $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was put in his car with a trailer at the invitation of 90 paintings.
It says Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a bagger to enter the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feast.
The Agency reported that, according to a police prosecution, Frazetta Junior claimed, he was instructed by his father to "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a warehouse".
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior decided to have granted any permission.
Labour defends rises in food and tax
Ministers have defended the increases in taxes and expenditure stopped in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economic and trade union.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given an opportunity to "squeeze" to show that he seriously meant the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer also advised that he was aimed at workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% capture limit of public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security injuries
The trade unions, on the other hand, protested that low wages receivers are punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned against emerging "problems".
The increase in social insurance - about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has angry the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be to the economic growth.
The increase limited to those who earn more than 20 000 pounds per year will cover about 10 million workers.
SCHERPUNCTIONS OF THE FORAB ETATAL REPORT
Increase of social insurance by further 0.5 % from April 2011
This year's economic shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on bankiers bonuses
1 percentage increase in the tax on the company for small enterprises
Tax leaves for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the tax office, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds will be more than 90 pounds per year and a person with 40,000 pounds per year will be at 190 pounds worse, while a person with 100,000 pounds annual income will be 110 pounds more rich.
The Ministers said that their objective of the half-life of deficit by 2013 meant "frequent decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burdens would fall from the 5% of the top earnings.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the cutting taxes and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half and this is also necessary over the period of the next four years," he shared the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions on the future economic growth – which influences the extent of the new debt and the speed of the deficit - were questioned after the taxpayer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably decrease by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline by 3.5% predicted in April, while the debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than before.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The conservatives, who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour's "Schuldenkrise", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is insecurity.
They added that the Ministers failed to submit a credible plan, how to repay this and press "zynically" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "You had their opportunity to do this, and they let them go."
"The important announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour persists that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future reductions, other than in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capture more rapidly and rather come.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "constructed on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the notices - like the above inflation adjustment for some invalid pensions in April - the treasurer would suspend the voting decision, as the money could be recovered just next year.
Labour persists in providing extra aid when people need it most necessary and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Healer Etat"
Although the Ministers have not given further details of food beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public expenditure will only take place on the medium-term.
The recognised Tax Surveillance Institute said that the figures of the treasury cannon would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in future in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only moves the pain on later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the economic audit firm Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
FBI examines "Festings of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested by an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab Province, the American message in Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported as missing in the United States State of Virginia last month.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistanic descendants, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a jemenite background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the points of accusation that are being put before them and under which circumstances they are held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Sweet said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was in connection with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistan authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house before, and that was not yet charged against the men arrested.
The news Agency Reuters reported that it refused foreign minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "more work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eliminate the infrastructure of terrorism which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuses" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International Human Rights Organisation, human rights in Iran remain as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed the "missuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was hit and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected the earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, which led to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands received penalties and chargers said that at least five people were condemned to death.
The BBC-Teheran Korrespondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse claims recognized and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak station.
But since then, there has been no more tolerance for criticism from the authorities, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari's report, which said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protest against the election results.
"They more often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was still bleeding and half-conscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The struck presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that in August some demonstrations who had been arrested were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuses have taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that with 75 others more than eight weeks he had been arrested in a container in a prisoner in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian Parliament and the court authorities had founded a committee that should examine the disruptions after the election and reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandate and power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a true sign into Bristol into a competition pist.
The shipists of this park event attracted 16 half-professional skiers and snowboarder, fighting for money prices.
On the top of the hang in the Brandon-Hill-Park there was a short jump cannon at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
Student John Hickman, who studys medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful look at the top of the hang, but it was also very intimidating.
It's a great look with all the lights of the city that glitch below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the country here - some of the right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best pieces or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to the melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss electors voted for a ban on the construction of Minarets and the concerns about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a founded and well-overlooked report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most so-calledly secularized societies of Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love head towels" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and thickly argumentary study of a dispute that shared the country over a half decade and occupied, and their effects are still to be observed today.
Bowens newest book offers a more comprehensive and cosy spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it Bowen calls "Islamian free spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students on the questions that they are most concerned.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a cottage (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a zins-oriented banking system to obtain a hypothectic?
It is these seemingly profound matters, he claims that the daily life is quite unlike the political dramas that the media are busy.
The author recognises a new generation of imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly except Tarik Ramadan, a Arabian-Muslim scholar and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim, and on the other hand, a good national in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are unfair to the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked Bowen are mostly inconsistent with their salafi counterparts – prosecutors of purist sinus Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – which today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) are really obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harder treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism.
He recognises rather a "shareing of value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The Faithlessest View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other environment region on earth.
The ice that she identifies is melting with alarming speed and takes life with which nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have come into the newly open water, with diplomas, lawyers and now also authors in their chicken waters.
Richard Ellis, a author and Illustrator, signed in "On thin ice" (Original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the northern iceberry.
Besides the complicated history and policy of the whale catch, he describes the long tradition of the arktic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a iceberry as a courageous 14-year-old fennrich to the lake, which struggled only with the gun flask of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears that were caught when they swimed behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zooes and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 iceberries showed an idea.
Even today, zoo plants still typically have a millionstel of the lives of a wild ancient animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The iceberry in Singapore was very green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of his pels.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for survival of the species.
Although it prohibits in Norway, America and Russia, the construction in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding inuits use powerful storm guns to bring their prize to the route.
Ironically, the ice will remain at the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the Science Magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographs can properly explain the speed of the changes.
But this is not a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century gave the first time the confusion of the package.
Undersee boats strongly in the Cold War the moving crying under the underrun.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the spacious distribution of measuring suns on icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by unangry people who are camping outside in the cold.
Anderson throws a look into the strange, small world of the fluid system within the arktic ice, which is formed by salt water rinses that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from bear on the ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer is gone, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, we could be."
Marine infantists were among the 6000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
The Upper Free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single crane on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other marine infantists, who took the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedeshof in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they entered.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be that, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of Veteranen in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate hundreds of graves on the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife, Karen, who takes this journey each year, standing in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (lines across America), which also expanded the event to other countries.
In this year, volunteers placed more than 16000 cranes on the graves on the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Friedeshof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the United Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent more than $150.000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she took the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband is not deprived in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Inpacked in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked across the expanded racing surfaces and hills of the Friedhof.
The volunteers had older graves from the first and second World War and Vietnam war as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played and pairs kept on their hands, while they wore the fresh cherries to the gray-coming grave stones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
Sect. 60, which is nearby, where most of the veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the darkness of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends were attached to each other in the ice-air.
Some read the names melted in stone, while others turned down to small black-white cards that had been put for those in the moisturised mud whose grave stones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who lost bitter tears before her son's grave.
She went 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave place of marine infrance subofficier David Shane Spicer, who fell in the fight in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. Government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the U.S. government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with seat in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, US authorities for international development and for the world bank.
Consular officials of the United States Interest Representative in Havana try to gain access to prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific points of charge have not yet been published, although, in Cuban law, a Cuban national or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of the "hazard".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, present a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be severe crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community that is directed by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorisation to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama Government, which aimed at a "slow" approach to improving the relationships with the island.
The message of arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will produce a counterfeit when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are most likely used for sending text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day wage.
Internet use is extremely limited to the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access is limited to many websites.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in Cuba are imprisoned for crimes such as drug smuggling behind grids, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Representative in Havanna.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and prison are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the free delivery of mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", a play of the office of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, condemned and arrested within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move together for more dialogue willingness.
Pakistanian government representatives reveal the plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistanian authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help discover a broad network of terrorist advertisers who search for the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they had been looking for an opposed rebellion, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of these comments on terrorist attacks had delivered on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribe belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermigration the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unfair mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refugee place.
They were regarded as part of a hidden surgery.
They were therefore rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and were still trying to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistan penalty authorities.
The case of the five men - which are still in Pakistan and are consulted by the FBI - emphasizes the decisive role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important, in the decision to decide who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made it a matter of the highest urgency to place human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organisation act as a pluralist who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those that could be spionies.
Analytics said that American wanter rekruts are subject to a special examination by A Kaida.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda values, they are also considered unfairly attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest Analytics of the NEFA foundation with seat in the USA, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more careful in order to allow them access, because the US home services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Ten thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen demand climate-"Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and called for more courageous action in climate protection by the under-sales at the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrants said that 100.000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were rather about 25,000.
The event survived relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists burned small bombing bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day, when the climate negotiations supported by the UN were little, thousands of activists wandered through the city, on which "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christiansen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of birth of their mother, make her aware of the heartwarming problems that the country has to tackle because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - in order to extend the word and appeal to the world leaders, to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a simple task, but it has to be done now and there's no way around it.
The police dismissed the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre too close and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or brought pockets.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrations in black clothes burned several sprinklers near the Copenhagen main channel, near which several ministers are located.
They threw them close to the buildings, he said, and added that they started as light-raketers, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
In the interior of the Congress Centre, people gathered before television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems not to have reached the consciousness of the main functionalists, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the place of event is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of wide public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show tough racial air
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although Washington’s district is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest performances, the evidence shows that the four and eight clasps in the past two years have made faster progress than the cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the national evaluation of the educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard-to-earth performance clue between afro-American and white students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average number of white four-year closures from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance ceiling actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the afro-American eight-classers remained essentially the same, he fell to a statistically neglectable point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample volume was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The climb, which separated white and black quarter closures in 2003 when the first NAEP was included in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that the children of both groups have reached has grown in this period, the difference with now has hardly reduced 58 points.
Some educational supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results that were celebrated by schoolman Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic citizen Adrian M. Fenty have been advanced most of white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that joins educational equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump for a span of two or three points up and down, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test points numbers is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what fears me is that we do not use the time and energy that we need to use for our Middle School.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
For example, in this autumn, some teachers are trained to use a new lecture plan, the Wilson reading system, which aims at students in the upper classes of the basic school and the Middle School, which have not mastered basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their equal-aged classmates.
All-day mathematics, a teaching plan that puts the front from the children's garden to the sixth class of games and lifetime experiences, was brought to Washington under the former school inspector Clifford Janey, and this training plan is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work on giving the best measures to the students below the level of notes, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools that are necessarily necessary to reduce the climb.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, which examines urban test results.
The conventional drug is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could lead to political reactions working against this important agenda.
The weakness point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that it is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance ceiling is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
The school year must be increased to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 climbs out and blossoms a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the bricks and the smaragd green grass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now lived in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and those of the other eighth classes of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the teaching cost $38.690 per year, were rather the enthusiastic students who were a distressing visitor than the enthusiastic students in the future.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now joined the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thought when she was reported the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh visiting children on their three-day tour and now they fully accepted the planned message: The question is not whether to go to the college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of America of hispanic immigrants who do not end the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college training that is necessary to rise to the middle layer.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important, as researchers say, because for a generation that will play a huge role in the employees of the country, they show the way forward.
Those who explore powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
However, consulting programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts remain longer.
If you look at incoming weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them search through the system, a single measure will not at any time solve the problem, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from the preschool to the high school.
The federal programme that Gracielas College tour had financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turning up a walk - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income weak students are at the middle school and continue to run until they finish the high school.
According to the US Department for Education, the programme has helped over 10 million students, of whom more than 60% went to college since 1999.
Iraqi oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to bring larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies from the Iraqi Ministry of Oils point out that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 increased fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that gave a command has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields raised in June.
The thin seed representatives of American oil multitis when opening the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. businesses gave Asian and European the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still underlined by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the U.S. Military probably prevented American oil companies from taking part in Iraq, which has the world's third largest raw oil reserves.
U.S. firms were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other Stately controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wages and are more risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its companions and will fulfil its obligations toward Iraq.
For the provision of pre-selected companies, bids were issued, which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil, which the Ministry was ready to pay in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planners of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US rocket attack along the Pakistan border to Afghanistan, this week is supposed to have been killed a top planner of Al Kaida, so representatives of US terrorist control reported on Friday.
This would, if it was confirmed, be the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabians who were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles in the region in accordance with US source and Pakistan, which took their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's unlawful tribe belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents who were suspected of belonging to the soldiers ran to the place and quickly took all that was left of the "fullly destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorist control led unspecified evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, which led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy throughout the world, noticed a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the warm nature of the US-American air attacks on Pakistan ground.
It also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe when it was assumed that its central role was given.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had rapidly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be familiar with some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not reduce the danger that he represented for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban, who had been killed since September when a similar attack was killed by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the family area and three other topactivists.
The rate of attacks by the CIA drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their attackability and, at the same time, kill the suspects brutally, the page reported.
Leader of UN Senders in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leader of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would be withdrawn from his office in March, which would end a stormy term, which was disturbed by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UNO.
The Obama government has decided to send 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he supported the army increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their army forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and by sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil assistants to help with the political change in Afghanistan.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said he did not settle his office, but only meets one agreement against his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon will now be forwarded so that he can have time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban started searching for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he took into consideration the Swedish-Italian Chamber Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN Mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously conducted UN peace operations.
Edes position in Afghanistan was tested after his former chairman, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to preferred President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections in the country and to exchange evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "had undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because already a large degree of skepsis in relation to international interference in the elections".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American armies in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries spending for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Ede expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the UN conventional arrangements have undermined its possibilities of bringing capabilities to people.
The UN rules have been so designed that I have been able to set one person since May, he said.
It's a catastrophe and it can't go on that way.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional penalties
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world forces will soon "bedecisive additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in the North Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there is no good choice, he said in answer to the question of a soldier to the probability of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that has been unpredictable to war."
The Obama Government considers a sanction package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average irians.
He said that a "packet of positive and negative incentives" is required, "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "your people will suffer incredibly" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. Government joined European top politicians in the warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if he does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be obtained for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and avoid a major part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The U.S. Government has urged this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreements since that time - partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is inconsistent about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some proposals which they had already agreed in early October, openly said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought together in a way as they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31st dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continues to pursue other options, including those mentioned by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once "repressing sanctions".
In a opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation with the United Nations condemned what it called "unfunded and unfunded claims" on Thursday by some of the Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, ownership rights and the breakdown of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to prevent delays in the U.S. plans to reduce the American force from 15.000 to 50.000 until the end of August.
Gates also tried to distinguish the Kurdish concerns about the forthcoming troop departure. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in course in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who held them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have learned so well that as government officials in Shanghai, who, through the low birth rate and the older population this summer suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediately and definitely: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, displaced individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperor", raises a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force, the UN
The section for population issues determines, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 is to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively to the year 2050. This is far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The inequality is stronger in rich coastal cities with educational population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people have composed almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghais, while the birth rate is below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, leader of the Shanghaier City Population and Family Planning Comission, said that pairs in the profound age need to get babies to "help to reduce the proportion of older populations and to reduce the lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-kind policy is likely to be the most controversial one that has been introduced by the dominant Communist Party until today.
Parents who violate this policy must expect enormous penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical claim of the natural national resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural regions, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to dismiss.
Many pairs had also been able to carry out sexually active abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to a child policy.
In 2004, they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husbands and wife have been single children -- and the tone of many hard slogans was deceived in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Peking, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing pairs to allow two children with which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was launched in July as the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Placates that the families were taught to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that detailed describe who gets in question for a second child and how to apply for the approval.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push out information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outermost areas of Shanghai said that there is a rise in the applications of pairs who want a second child after the campaign start, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the Municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications per month are still invoked.
Disappointed Shanghaier officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165.000 despite the campaign -- something higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghaier municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want children.
They want to give her first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this was also legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a small sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West judge the one-kind policy falsely as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, you rob us the possibility of having more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other pairs specify psychological reasons for their patience.
Wang, the head of staff, said she wants only one child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for everyone.
We are not used to care for others and we do not really want this."
Chen Sieian, a 42-year-old, a translation company belongs to, said it more unbloomed.
For parents from the middle stand with double career, by which the birth rate is lower, he said that it is a success to be successful and to be egoistic.
He said that the age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiments and they don't want such a life for themselves, at all.
A single child, he said, also sets huge demands for the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a lifetime ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one that has achieved a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to offer too many sacrifices.
UNO Group develops emission reduction plan
The UNClimate Conference, which has so far been awarded by wild positions and mutual accusations, has again focused on the publication of a document on Friday, which for the next 40 years has recorded an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, whereas industry nations would have to cultivate the largest loads in the near future.
The text which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation has demonstrated both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was regarded as an important progress in a negotiating time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which has been formulated by a UN working group for this purpose, is silent over the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can manage the global warming on a short and long-term basis.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large threshold countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of global temperature increases would be to the political decision-makers.
The process will be given a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-sided document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would combine their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
In addition, the European Community has given the talks on Friday an incentive through its assurance to deliver over the next three years 3,6 billion US dollars per year to support poorer countries to adapt the impact of climate change from the master of floods and drying to the prevention of deforestation.
Yet, Friday brought the same verbal fireworks, which the conversations had decided last week.
The U.S. Climate Officer Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger threshold countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representative of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger thresholds and take measures, such as Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern delivered his opinion an hour after the explanation of the Chinese Vice-Austria minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American air trafficker was either lacking "the sense" or it was "his very unresponsible" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help financially to master global warming.
The future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, and both in the industrial nations, as well as between the industrial nations and the threshold countries, has opened broken lines.
The current struggle also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States are opposed to their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen influenced countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken more aggressive action to account for the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic prey, such as Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the impact of climate change claimed that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a draft of 24-sided contracts in the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the openness of the small island states is "the political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and demand measures from the threshold countries, such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be explained before the government leaders arrive in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, like the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Presidents, disappeared their aircraft and rushed through the passages of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to put off Claimes negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the congregation -- 13.000 people go in and out every day at the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organize nightly shows where they make fun about the countries who think they tell and sell, and contract drafts are hand-to-handed rather than by email - are already a challenge.
The intensity is based only on: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen will be.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of the Organization of Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5:13 a pepper will strike the darkness to announce a survival which represents a revolution in the traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed pendler train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras and set 93 km back in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will then join the lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new Great Britain service will finally connect to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and connect the large ballast areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working hours would radically reduce and the change of aircraft and cars to train would reduce the national carbon emissions and the status on the roads.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
However, the many billions of British pounds, which are required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage, could still pull the brake in the British high-speed glasses.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will lead to a five-metre gaming space in urban areas and in places where the impacts on the environment are controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final distance.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-steady high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to it in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-sharing route, which would lead a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a subway would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part line, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today a little more than one hour.
The drafts offer the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains can run with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can be in operation on the London-Birmingham route.
This would, again, mean that in London, a final station would be needed, at which 20 000 travellers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to undermine the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains should first change from high-speed lines to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to travel between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive crack point to ensure a change from the plane to the rail, a directional measure for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come for hypothecity for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery that he is building in his house in his election circle.
The prison speaker of the party, which was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about the need to live "of magnificent rations", has increased his hypothecity by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak wood craft at his branch house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for the taxpayer for the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The managers of the sub-house approved the applications at that time and they were not also questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-stage house in a village in his electoral district Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses, a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expensive control point of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden called "orrangement" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "Glashaus für Entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited, during a recent investigation of his previous hypothesis contracts, by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, to take a view to increasing the take-up of money.
The Committee released him last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a hypothectic over 271.406 pounds (30,000 euros) from his London House to his elective circuit house, which he purchased in 1991, one year before his election as a parliamentary member.
This week’s documents show that Duncan received some 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a hypothecene rate until March last year.
In April, its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS-Hypothek's interest rate has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the funding of 75,000 pounds (8,000 pounds) served.
The normal stainless RBS hypothecene rate decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the sub-house in September after a subcover reporter filmed him when he said after the expenditure candal that parliamentary members would live "of magnificent Rations".
"In essence, it means, if you work for the state, you must live from mager rations and how S***e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and I have the right to a disappearing small portion, measured by what is belonging.
And I could have claimed all the fucking sum, but I don't."
The parliamentary member, a millionary of his former career as an oil-gross dealer, was first attacked for his expenditure in May when it was clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the party office that this could be considered "as overdriven demand".
As a protester in Duncan's Rasen, an activist buried a hole in the form of a pound mark after being known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was asked yesterday night about the increased hypothecity, Duncan said: "This had been approved by the Fees Office, as well as the following by Legg to the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate on deviations and penetrations or a blending of the rules or similar ones.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clear."
Come all of your believers to admire Brightons Beachhütten Advent Calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new life content for winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their houses as topics for every December day with Christmas songs.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were allowed to view the latest cabin every day from 17:30 to 18:30 p.m. at free fluorescent wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The currently selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noel", where the cabin decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorable clergyman of the Chichester diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and celebrate exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach cabin advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such an amazingly creative and vibrant place and we try to express this by our spirituality."
Heavy mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
On Saturday and in Copenhagen, ten thousands have demonstrated the world to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate heating, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundred thousands according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation of the world for climate will contribute to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the train has passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, completely dressed in black, had crushed windows with patches and hammers, a journalist of the AFP established.
Anti-unruption police have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your appreciation, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, of these extreme violent splitter groups, who have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in the eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizations of the demonstration, has under which hundreds of militant attachers were arrested "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handles and seat position.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrations have stopped about 500 metres away from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, welcome for one evening with candle light, taking part of the former South African Erzbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrations have been travelled with fines and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with heavenly blue rainforests, have made a first rise in Copenhagen in the morning, since you have followed the call of the friends of the earth, "blue times" for the "klima justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a reconciliation of the ecological debt for the benefit of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, philipinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep on saying that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water runs where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of the Climate Diplomation, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics approached the environmental organisations.
The European parliamentary José Bové, the design of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Clean Rights and Social Rights": "There is no difference today between the fight against climate heating and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pazifican space, where many islands are located, which are particularly threatened by heating, has given the start of the demonstrations.
Approximately 50 000 people have gone to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, most of them students marched in red and hated bandanas, in which you praised the sun's energy.
In Hong-Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrations took place in order to demand a powerful approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille, south, in Lille (Northern), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
In Geneva, some people have gathered.
The Separatist Abchasia has chosen his President, Georgia denounces that it is here a "great".
On Saturday, Abkhasien elected his President, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian region as self-employed, Tbilissi denounced the "Streich".
About 130,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Gorgean War of August 2008 for control over the South-Osset Territory, another Georgian sixsionist area that was recognised by Russia.
The electoral rooms have closed GMT at 17 o'clock.
The participation of the elections was about 58%, according to the abchasian electoral Commission responsible, a few hours before the electoral locking.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, kategoriously reject the idea of a reconciliation with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These choices are a farce.
On his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, repents that Abchasia is now under an uncertain total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the autonomy of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world observes it as a part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it was separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousand people died, Abchasia wishes to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen Lord Bagapch.
She was one of the electorals who went to a choice room in a school in the capital city of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Grosse signs on which bagapch is seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the District Chairman, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said, at a small celebration, to play on the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abchasia's autonomy.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered a glass of Wodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abchasia Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one voice is necessary to win the choice.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Copenhagen
On Saturday, ten thousands of people have demonstrated everywhere in the world to request an ambitious and binding contract from the kopenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have ca. 700 people, at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, have demonstrated hundred thousands of people in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive the delegates from 193 countries, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament marched from the peaceful train towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrations have stopped about 500 metres away from the centre and have not tried to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for one evening with candle light, taking part of the former South African Erzbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, who were completely dressed in black and were armed with backstones and with brakes, began to beat discs, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unruption police have immediately circulated you and have handled without care by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have clarified that it is mainly "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
By evening, a policeman suffered an injury by a patch during the incidents where, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested, by a patch. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups handled," explained the speaker of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the regulators creep in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by rail or with their own vehicle from German large cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the heavenly blue rainy mantle, formed themselves in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" into a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climage rights".
"Today we go to the road to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," explained the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell us anymore, we still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that sealed, there are water runs through which you can run, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomation, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the globalisation counterparts approached the environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové, explained to the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference today between the fight against heating the earth and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pazifican space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the heating of the earth, has given the prompt for the demonstrations.
According to the words of the organizers in Australia, about 50 000 people have gone to the street.
In Manila, some hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertisements before the city management of the philippinian capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrations have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350" several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
In Geneva several people gathered.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycés.
The National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the fields strengthen geography and history from the school reform of the Lycés, even if they are not obligatoryly instructed in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) have now every four hours and the same programme," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this punishment must be overcome," because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but in general a concentration "the best student".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific one," he continued. He stressed: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been distressed about the lack of historical geographic education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey appeared in Humanité showed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticizes the state project of the deletion of obligatory education in history and geography in the S terminals (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also affected this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the Minister answered that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the programme of the terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (studios and trade unions) had called on on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believes is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year, in Master 2 (M2), they were undergoing a professional suitability test and at the end of the year of an authorisation test, in which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they carry out practices during the M2 year and then teach one year before the students as teachers in the practice.
He continued to say: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you can reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a case that does not exist in the education of people."
He confirmed again that he wanted to finish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday tomorrow at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, the peace nobel prizemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts call up 15 minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
One wants to do something to reach the people and raise the feeling of more learning in them, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Their experts were elected around the twenty discussion participants, even after their charisma," he explained.
"For air heating you can speak for hours. However, the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who only spoke freely with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners may note that "the Conference of Copenhagen is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be available online on the page of the school from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months.
Payment withdrawal : angry prison guardians, actions planned
On Friday, the Federations of the Penal Officers called on a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payments were suspended for budgetary reasons to January are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second trade union of the penalty officer ("FO-Pénitentiaire") urged the employees who did not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday tomorrow before the penalty agency and block them in order to pay attention to the "dealer of what is given to them".
The CGT-Pénitentiaire's 3rd trade union called on to "combine a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtimes, night supplements and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be burned as the "schady and unacceptable" market.
The first trade union of criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institute Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilisations (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The leadership of the Criminal Assembly and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtimes have increased significantly in 2009 and were not all in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the penalty officers in which the payment is guaranteed next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernise our criminal enforcement system," the Minister of Justice notes in this letter.
"I have instructed the leadership of the penalty institution to take immediate measures so that such a situation, which has arisen by a lack of assessment of the overtimes incurred, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is more magnificent, except for the management staff that comes in the enjoyment of high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budgetary forces" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the Interregional Federation FO in Marseille admits to "all congregations and calls" to new instructions.
"The staff are not going to work on Sundays and holidays, if then the hours of October still are not paid in December. This also applies to their overtimes," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are carried out without more personnel being set up, the attempt to reach the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says Bordeaux' CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, and some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, as the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he distributes Christmas ever better gifts than he gets himself.
The U.S. President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has poured out at the TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will distribute ever better gifts than he gets.
When a special mission was broadcast on Sunday evening through the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight on how to spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four-foot companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims for the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she calls the President.
"Please," he cryed her narrowly and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV operator, who Barack Obama had supported so fiercely during his electoral struggle, the President and his wife also spoke about gifts that she had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, which he had very rarely seen, brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"But a lot later in my life I understood that I had this ball of him."
The first lady remembered her puppet house on her side.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the chain. But I loved this little popping house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL confirms that he was moved to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again surgered in Los Angeles because of significant "injury" after an operation in France. According to the survivors surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although the RTL confirms that the singer was moved to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles in the night of Thursday, after the American doctors had discovered "injuries due to the operation of a bandship", which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have re-operated.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical advice would be available within 48 hours.
However, according to the RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma in order to avoid "smoking and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, a little more certainty was given to the condition of the patient than he opened the eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
The RTL also confirms that after his first operation in Paris, "non-line drenage" was made.
The rocker had been operated in the International Clinic of Parc Monceau because of a bandship.
The action planned over several days was carried out by the Neuro surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments on the CRL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered on Monday in the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was convinced against the RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that you need "no worry" to make the rock musician, since this is a "good fighter".
"He had still called me to Los Angeles before his departure. I told him it was weak to put myself in an aircraft after such an operation 12 hours, that's not going," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "gut reacts to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was damned".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the wife of the singer, and he had no special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer has grown since he brought in a hospital in July nine days after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small darm cancer-OP", which resulted in a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer, as planned, took his long "Tour 66" as a departure.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer on the stage was trying to move.
At mid-November, the people surrounding him had to denote a re-introduction to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet on its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, held an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethan clothing was allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the two other through Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the gentlemen.
Shadow for Bousquet, who wanted to take off the 50m free style after the world record, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old French claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet rejected the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my range, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers started in polyurethan attractions, which were prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which started the same competition for the first time in 1999.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not improved its best time over 400m free style (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
United States : Counterboard at Zola estimated to 1.5 million US dollars
On Thursday, a Roman graph plate, which appeared in the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to $1.5 million above its value, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIIth century after Christ and was always evaluated by $150.000 to $250.000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionisos are represented in a sophistic architecture decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Stigting of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sothebys, on Tuesday against the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most of so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola is far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, afterwards she showed pieces for pieces at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III. French Republic and President of the Council, before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in darkness.
In the search of the Louvre database Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "Emile Zola's inheritance", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon Macquart".
Zelayas Trip from Honduras towards Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for transfer of the collapsed honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic ground as no longer compatible after this lead had rejected by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya held in the night, it seems that everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of carrying out this transfer are inconsistent, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft set by the Mexican Government, which had arrived on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its exit.
The Putsch government wanted to need M. Zelaya for "deployment" and ask him for political asylum in abroad.
However, the collapsed President refused this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the greeting, official Head of State.
The Putsch regime "had suffered a new failure by trying to give me up on my expenses (...), they wanted me to abstain," said Thursday M. Zelaya against Radio Globo, where he often reported to me since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the Mediterranean country in five months.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the collapsed President, who had escaped to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some accords.
The Mexican message has presented us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, had explained on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Putsch Government, to the Hunduran Radio HRN.
I'm not looking for asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had responded to an interview with the channel Telesur whose seat is located in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, so he had underlined, he would only take as President of the Honduran people.
The reputations about an exit of M. Zelayas had mobilized the attendants of the collapsed President, who had opened up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, and then the military there had increased its efforts.
The Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to his appreciation, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venedig President Hugo Chavez, was disturbed on 28 June, on the day of his organized national survey for the preparation of his reconciliation, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile to Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and escaped to the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he is arrested for high betrayal, which he is accused of by justice, so the Putsch Government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to trigger M. Zelaya.
While Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, or Brazil were rejected.
Three days later, the cogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in the arrival, the US trade balance produces optimism
The New York Exchange completed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the US trade balance prove a currency of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67%, Nasdaq is 0.33%.
According to the figures at the stock exchange conclusion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, the Nasdaq again dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was added to 1.102.35 points by 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anekdotic under the premise that the market focused only on "half-filled glasses", then it measured.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, the investors are especially fixed to the figures of the American trade balance, "which is improving the activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion, compared to September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit growth.
Imports and exports have increased.
The major news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, reflecting the economic growth of the main trade partners in the United States, so Christopher Cornell commented on business research Economy.com.
In contrast, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the status of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers in the last four weeks had fallen "to the depth of the year," Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of State bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482 % compared to 3.432 % from the day of service, the profitability of the loans to 30 years to 4.492 % compared to the 4.408 % from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of parties standing on power peppers "Damen in Weiss" out
Some hundreds of cubian forces have put out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and have also destroyed another announcement, because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
In order to put out the forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, on the open street of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the Fussmarsch in the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankes!, "Soldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionarys!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!" scanned the powered partisans with lifted faust against the dissidents.
The latter were eskorted by civil agents who had appeared to "serve their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had been played in Havana in the evening before, where it did not come to harm or arrests.
On the other hand, a dozen dissident, who was temporarily arrested by civil police officers in the Havanner District of Vedado, also on Thursday, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
The police have, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents of the government, who were exposed to violence in civil vehicles.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates of the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" have organised an unauthorized entrance for the purpose of the "Please release of all political prisoners", whose number of dissident lists has about 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a 20-year prisoner.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 cubian dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which up to the date 53 sits behind grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime owners as "soldner" or "agents" in the services of the declared archfound, the United States.
A reality is that the Cuban television reported the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "Contra-revolutionarys".
The Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NROs of the infringement of rights and freedoms, especially of freedom of opinion.
Wrong man kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-messed mad man killed an eighty-year-old in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday against late afternoon for the main business time in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne.
According to the first inquiry, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-olds for an unclear cause in or before a pharmaceutical on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and accordingly, police statements, with the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported by an officer of the police synthetic alliance in the hospital to cause the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he knocked a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirty-shirts, has attacked and was hurt.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eighty died.
The other injured person is in life danger, as he, according to police sources, seems to have affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in the "choosing state".
The armed man who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence according to police statements should be evolved on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passengers, apparently randomly: a three-six and a forty-year-old, with the last one of both difficult.
The scenario stayed in darkness in the evening.
He had been armed with two meshs, which he had crossed behind his back, explained in the place of Arnaud Pressé, a man responsible for the Syndikate Alliance of the area of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including youths, should have tried, according to the reports of the ACP, to make an end to the indignant.
I've seen a guy in the three-shirts with a green west.
Three adolescents tried to cry in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a cellar of a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the army.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their chief officer, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with trade fairs, so police information.
The event has been played in one of the main attackers of Clichy-la-garenne, where a number of businesses are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them to the first-help post and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came injured by cutting wounds.
The forces of the State Police have definitely arrested the man who had no certificates.
Nanterre's state lawyer has ordered the Criminal Police Office of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to explore the case.
The crazy one was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been judged.
A police source does not preclude him from being transmitted to a nerve nurse.
According to another police source, six police officers petitioned him to bind him to the Police Commissioner in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of surgery" like "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tather-time".
United States: Polanskis lawyer calls for reconciliation of criminal persecution
The lawyer of the French-polnic filmmaker Roman Polanski has asked for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (Californien, Western United States) to leave criminal persecution against his client, who is currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral distortion of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has prompted three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California at the time of negotiation in 1977.
I call on the place of refuge, explained M. Hummel before adding that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the proceedings, "it runs down a cold back."
The judge Rittenband, before he fell his judge's pronunciation, discussed with a lawyer who should have said to him, Roman Polanski deserved a discipline house, which represents a grave procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioning state lawyer David Wells.
M. Wells had finally explained at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "belogen".
If the Court of Justice refuses to initiate the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel calls for the leadership of a process which would allow him to submit the evidence of his argumentation.
On the other hand, the accusation has repeated the proof being explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the deeds charged to the accused person cannot be considered seriously as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had escaped from the United States in 1978, even before the proclaiming of the criminal measure because of "villy sexual relations" with a minor age of 13 years.
Since that time, he hasn't traveled to the United States anymore.
The vice-president of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski must be "da to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to others accused that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In your opinion, "the film manager asks the Court for a favor and thereby neglects his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even pointed out that there are other escape alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the punishment of Roman Polanski.
Also, the lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, demanded again the suspension of the criminal procedure.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be tolerated by any reconsideration of the Affaire Polanski and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-thirds are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest order.
After spending two months behind grids, he was sentenced to his Chalet in Gstaad, in expectation of any delivery to the house arrest in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the increase in the dollar and closed without a price.
The New York exchange closed on Friday without a course, in a market that was shaken between better indicators than the United States and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technology dominated Nasdaq has made 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Perhaps, the market is quite quiet," Mace stated the view silver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned to "contribute to improving market views to the solidarity of the economy," the analysts of Charles Schwab collapsed.
In the United States, sales in retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in each other and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of the American consumers has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the index was reduced by a new increase in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level in relation to the euro for two months, thus pressing down ''the sectors incurred for the economic situation', explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The debt market has decreased.
The income of the treasury loan over 10 years has increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the loan over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates will override the last hit on Saturday to realise their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman of the world and to watch this before a billion televisions.
During this great beauty fair, which is organized for the second time in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already gone to the semi-finale.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut to Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a truly thrill of pleasures.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were just extraordinary.
I've seen many things and made a lot of experiences!" said Miss Sierra Leone with an enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 17 p.m. (15 p.m.) on Saturday.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to give my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "atmospheric landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on competition.
The Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was chosen in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman of the world, but it's not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defilate in traditional complaints and do not forget, in the bathroom suit.
The idea is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty King of South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a manager of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that receiving the world with a hardly overwhelming heartfeltness and proudness, insures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African president Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was very exceptional.
Not common for a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, their most beautiful memorial remains the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I'm sure to come back to World Championship 2010, promised excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "very positive" according to his son David.
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "very positive," insured his son David on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all running very good, David Hallyday explained the press at the exit of the plane where he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "snout" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was submitted to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation at a band skiing event on 26 November.
The singer "this night in Los Angeles was placed into an artificial coma to facilitate his strong pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to a artificial coma in which he was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a bandship operation on 26 November.
The singer had to undertake a surgery in the night from Wednesday on Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the late intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, took part on Friday tomorrow in a school event at the French University of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade is going to school, a photographer of the AFP.
The Chief of the Department of Orthopedical and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer severely loaded Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he made the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were totally distressed, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that a court may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled too fast and this has traveled with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned this doctor who assured me that he viewed this trip as totally unusual, which had surprised me, since I myself have two band disk operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced at the RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without Drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, which has been sentenced several times because of failures to surgery and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical chamber, called him "a man without screws" who has to be "regular" to be responsible for the Chamber Board and "all other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been exercising since late summer, seems to be questioned.
It is quite clear that it is too little for continuing the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The Party Association UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes powerful and calls on the Party Nouveau Centre not to use its seal anymore.
The party covenant, supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem on Friday, reacted intensely to an acquisition of the seal, once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the Chairman of the Party of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him to use this seal on no longer under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he considers that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In view of his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (heavy UMP, now at NC), who raises a right to the ownership of the UDF brand, as he first applied this brand for the Institute national de la propriété industriale in 2004.
However, the business cells of the UDF Party Association, supervised by François Bayrous's Friends, broken the silence and made it clear that they did not let themselves escape and set a deadline to the Minister and to the Member under the threat of a judicial persecution, not to use this seal and to transfer the ownership of the brand.
In recent days, you have made a number of statements that you would suggest your political movement, take the UDF seal+, the party bond wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party MoDem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Association.
They also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogan + the present UDF +, on their political material as well as on the website of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, declared the UDF business office and urged the NC party to "unfortunately remove the name of UDF from all material and (her) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette called for "to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to their legal rights".
If you refuse this, we will raise complaints against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their writing, they stress that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends have "taken the choice" to leave these 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement, as it had already been done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre, therefore, has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Executive Board continues, "was he at the time when he applied for the trademark name, not a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
It benefits in scandalous and fraudulent ways from the lack of the rearing of the Acroym UDF in order to do this for himself.
In addition, you consider that this unreasonableness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more beneficial to make ourselves a name instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by putting ourselves in a deceitful way a name on which you have no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bedscourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for the exploitation of weaknesses
The Court of Justice of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to swallow itself part of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weaknesses before the court, for a criminal offence that is committed to a free penalty of no more than three years and a penalty of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this Affaire that is worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families of France in which mother and daughter are fetishing and at the same time have the cosmetic imperium of L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have previously refused to carry out such an investigation, notably under the conditions presented by Nanterre during the investigations of the state lawyer.
The doctors appointed on Friday should present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly announce whether and when Liliane Bedencourt could have been found in a condition of weakness.
I think she will carry out these investigations.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated and accused him to use the weakness of her mother for years in order to slightly slightly slightly slightly slightly squeeze a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Her side, Liliane Bettencourt had always rejected to have been manipulated by the photographer who she views as a long-term friend.
Although the court had to examine the reliability of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer, the lawyers of the lawyers led to a large family debtor on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain my daughter that I wrote to banana for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The state lawyer of Nanterre again believes that the applicant had no right to respond to this, especially because a premenced judge has refused its request to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no front.
Nobody has the right to act in her place," confirmed the representative of the lawyer, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to make a judgment after the process of the permissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the end of the strategic early information?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been incredibly ...
Since over a decade, the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution, said: "values" for the staff is determined the best as it was previously designed to hang on the consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies the marketing revolution the strategies of the acquisition of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separated factors preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicide at France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of F&E and, which are even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligenz) calls for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach from all the parties involved; it claims a use by the employees which fully contradicts the instructions of the authoritarian management.
We therefore call for an operational revolution that would consist in setting employees in the middle of the business's concerns alongside customers.
The very benefits of internal opinions
Will the internal opinions, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to his wages receivers, encourage this revolution with regard to the management praxis?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I could find out that, in view of a new situation, the whole of this event finally arrived in doing priority what it has always done.
Even because authoritarism - one of the pathologists of power - increases proportionately to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Its interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the large engineering schools.
They take over the ancient behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "Neurowscientifics" and uncertainly widely spread by research institutions and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "Hebel" (sic) in employees' engagement, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any consideration or practice of control: for the employees, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a given Doxa, which allows them to assess their viewed image of the company, as it provides them for the achievement of their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and place their human resource management back at the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday and were satisfied that the peace nobel price in 2009 defended the concept of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had spotted the award of the price to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President's candidate in the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wings of the Republican Party in the day newspaper USA Today, and added that it itself brought the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war into its just published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, strived to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the presdent had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really very good, the former President of the Representative House, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was consulted in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", has felt this speech historically.
The former Member, which is considered by some as a possible candidate for the republikan nomination for the election of the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Lefts" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not deliver a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolit" as "he always does," he spoke "as a American President," when he pointed out that the Europeans live "as in a security blaze that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights, the former UN Messenger John Bolton, a Falke of the Era Bush, referred to the National Review Online website as "sufficient, highly inspiring and inspiring".
On the left side of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the defendance of the army forces.
If you pack the war under the judicial deck, the massacre can be justified to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the tired left remains praising on the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was early forgiven to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "bears a plan for controlling international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says the Californian daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and examplely at the same time".
Remote drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike order and the threatening heavy supply passport at Christmas.
At the signature session on Friday evening, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement launched on Wednesday morning after several negotiations weeks.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated themselves in the early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement should be signed quickly in the late morning.
And that even though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed at 18:00 a.m.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to fear that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4 % for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9 % for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"It's not very much, but we're only starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centres anymore.
"There will probably always be some contradictors who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The President-in-Office of the TLF Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was" difficult to grant these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard on "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the increase of travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total set of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, enable the issue of 13 monthly content and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decline of the fees for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment from the government to the draft law of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "a identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be first applicable to the undertakings attached to this organisation and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour for the entire professional status.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", insured Bussereau.
The opposition of employer associations can only delay the procedure.
The UNTR Association practised a "devastating trade", because the 100 million euros" had already been promised to compensate for a part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to disperse the Gans essers on the nearby Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement is threatening "to create a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the line RER A, the largest highway network in France for Paris and the Île-de-France, continued in the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the leadership of the RATP (Unafhankable Paris Personal Transport Management), will continue to wait on the demands for wages.
At this important shopping week before Christmas, no trains went between 10:00 and 20:00 a.m. On the centre line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the centre line was ready to use one of four trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to change.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 20,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses technically".
The line RER A moves through the Paris balloon space from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two moves to the main traffic time went planously, and almost no one during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the rails as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had set up the situation.
As early as the morning, the railway station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less surrendered than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "a half an hour earlier to get time to work".
The SNCF, which had planned the care of travellers by staff and order forces, pointed out that there had not been any English in the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut came or drove over the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the metros there.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strugglers were again held, while the results that the associations had been reviewed after the meeting with the leadership peak on Friday afternoon were "diffy".
The RER business leader proposed the specific development of a protocol for RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional courses, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term reward.
The CGT was insulted that the RATP itself puts its wage proposals in a bracket and stressed that the leadership peak "is not able to solve a problem while this was possible in the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a reconciliation for the "examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership point that until the date rejected any discussion during the struggle and attended a meeting after calmness of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to RER B line after a vounctuation of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations call for a salary amount of EUR 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which 30 are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of occupational experience, have a breakdown lone of EUR 2.200 to 2.700 and a salary of EUR 600 to 650 for postal services as well as Sunday and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-kurdic party.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Curdian chief party; a decision followed the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the government's work that strives to reach the Kurdish Community's hand to end the conflicts for 25 years.
The "Partei for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, as it had become a "State for activities which are disadvantaged to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the chairman of Ahmet Turk and the parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for the duration of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the suspension of parliamentary immunity, which enjoys Turk and Tugluk, as well as the consolidation of the parties' goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The leaders of the parties expressed themselves before the judgment that parliamentaries would prefer to leave Parliament rather than to meet parliamentary parliamentaries.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP to follow the "Weises" of the Worker Party Kurafstand (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political view window of the PKK rebels.
The party insurs that "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to mention it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court's judgment works between the government, which is endeavoring to meet the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the support of the PKK to be sealed by the Kurds and to end the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a breakdown of tensions in south-east anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the arrest conditions of the PKK-Chef Abdullah Öcalan had led to conflicts with the police in the past weeks.
Since the announcement of the Court, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mainly populated by Kurden.
The order forces put tear gas granates and water gloves when the demonstrations began to throw Molotovcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turk assumed that the decision of the Court will "depth further deepen the despair".
"Turkey cannot explain this question (Curdish, i.e. editorial) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained the press.
The government, composed of a party from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed by principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedation of the democratic opening supported by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously make yourself focused on a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced a attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier. It was one of the brutalest attacks in the past months.
The snowfall can come
A really broken winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to shine the citizens, the FES Winter Service Manager says.
Specially so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is in line with a precise plan.
As soon as it cuts surfacely in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A trains with large-stroke vehicles will be run off, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and passways such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fireways, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and trails with cases, such as the Atzelberg Road.
The FES service begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be distributed in a maximum of three hours with moisture that is better affected.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "being the routes free until the professional traffic starts."
It'll be difficult when it cuts at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is ready to make the spray vehicles space."
Only afterwards, if it does not further cut, are supply and departure roads, including the Council-Beil-straits, on the line.
The last priority has sideways and sideways.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning the FES footvolk is on the way, hazard points and transitions are being priority.
For all cycling routes, the FES is usually unable to take care of.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in the eye from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is given on this fast smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Waves of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-fressing dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long shell with sharp, boiled teeth, short arms with silk crabs and a long cock.
If the species had lived a few million years later, she wouldn't have been special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these physical characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday magazine Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangéa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relatives, the spread and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other Paleontologists began with a grave on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs knee on one day, which is for example unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones identified the researchers quickly as new species.
In the course of the excavation, they had the remains of a total of five individuals together.
Found confirms theories about Dino-Frühgeschichte
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary foundation: "Dinosaurians from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only single pieces are found."
Other dinosaurists do not necessarily share the enthusiasmus.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but he confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says about Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current instruction, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, so the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the Echses split into their three main development lines: the meat-fressing theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as "long-healing" four-foot sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithishisia (bird basin sauriers), among which, for example, were the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, at the skull of Tawa hallae, the researchers found references to air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than those of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and light-building knees, the common ancestors of both groups have probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive, yet known dinosaurists lived in South America, the researchers follow that the Echses appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were already early separated and spread from South America across all the parts of the earth that then became a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangéa.
For this, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common, immigrant ancestor, arguing the researchers.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science Study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image because in South America, especially many primitive dino-fossiles have been preserved, while there is little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant cultivators of the earth's medieval age, it is still ridiculous.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight sauriers and with many more Echses.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relativeship at the border of the Trias was extinct to the jura.
Success history would not be everlasting
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs eventually survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story would not be forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals to flower, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then inspired a shadow of it: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are internationally.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Neapel are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casinos of the Frankfurt Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarizing with the protestant students at the Campus Westend.
In a German and English explanation "missible" they launched the police action by the Bureau.
The Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had released the buildings in the educational field last week, which were filled with walls and artworks.
Five students were injured.
The injury, judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "delegation and criminalisation of the protest" and dismisses the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The doctors demand the immediate rejection of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners have not supported the damage, says it.
Protest certified
The youth of the Federation Value and the German Federation also solidarizes with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landesjugendssekreter Alexander Klein.
However, Hessens Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of university president and police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener landday.
We have understanding for the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, so Peter Beuth, MEP of the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions SPD, green and left saw that.
The CDU takes painted walls as a premiere to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Link).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it has been cleared.
The left has submitted an application that calls on the Minister of Interior to report on police action.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, she was considered a secret city, inaccessible for western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret armor research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from Moscow's centre, is considered "russian silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had linked contacts with the Frankfurt Science Station of Riedberg - with the University Institutions and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Citizen Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Descendant Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ companies are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Reversely, Russian scientists want to engage in contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute for Electronics, the large groups of Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planstadt" for armor research.
Selenograd (letterly translated "Greenstadt") received his name from the forested hilllandscape where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply the "new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will collapse the city of the Bath-Württemberg National Capital for a decade in a healthless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with rails that ended in the middle of the city were then considered as transport engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake cloths of a modern rail transport, since it once took a huge amount of time to circulate locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, hold on, go on, go, go, go.
And therefore the headway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located on half the route of the trans-European rail magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the Slage of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being approached, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and the Bayrian Great City to implement the depth.
Headway stations, however, are no longer in- and exit problems since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and trucks at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE reconstruction line to Ulm is now attended.
Country and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The train is part of it, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Tax payers and not of the State Groups are.
The project can be somewhat justified by urban construction.
There is a new city space that - you think the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The train station and the route expansion are intended for the passenger transport, which - typically 80’s - was written to huge growth.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap pilots yet.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all aim at strengthening freight, since transport on rail is considerably environmentally friendly than by car on the road.
However, the new construction route does not stir for freight trains due to strong increases.
Even more grave is that S21 indirect also tangulates many other railway projects.
Six billion euros are to be banned in the swab.
That's the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
Fest stands, the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes points and engagements in the network.
Totally sixty larger projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the expansion of the nearly 180 kilometres long distance through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the trass has been built at the time rate.
It would be urgent to press right on the tube here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley line becomes the bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
Government verifies judgment on the airport
The country government has made open the landday of Wiesbaden, whether it will revise the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has ordered experts to make the more than 400 pages of VGH judgment legally verify, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written that the country had to regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Landbahn at the Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m. as the country government provides, should not be compatible with the legally required protection of the population from nightly airplanes.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this suspension and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision by the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Fraction Manager Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as "writing".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Greenen-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir in play on the FDP Wall Log "We keep Word".
Minister Posch rejected the prosecution of Schäfer-Gumbel, trying the country's government to come to their night flights with "distortion and tricks".
A precise jurisdiction needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they declare the opposition, the statements of his group had never been for the night flight ban.
U.S. Banks pay back help
The crisis-shaped U.S. large banks disappear their state fences.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp to a total of $45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans, according to a report by the US Sender CNBC, to refund state aid.
In this way, the Institutes want to eliminate the restrictions that were linked to the adoption of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of managerboni and the fixing of high fees.
The Bank of America had bought some $19 billion fresh money for investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled by sparrow sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money talks helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised itself to the highlight of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to make money on the capital market for the free of its liabilities to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US bank could announce about 20 billion dollars of severe increase in its capital, CNBC reported on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick choice
It went faster than I thought.
Shortly two weeks after the ZDF Management Council had pushed the official chief agent Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the transmitter may present a follower.
Yesterday evening, the body wanted to vote on staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation by the transmitter - officially in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it would also have played a role to not further harm the ZDF indigenant Markus Schakter, but this proposal should not also be carried out by the Administrative Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 Gremium members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of the edition of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schacher failed in the Administrative Board with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender to another five years.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a defeat for sharks, a expectable but.
Because the majority of the Union in the Administrative Board had signalled weeks before the election to not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Organized the opposition to the Chief Agent of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF's news posts had lost at incapacity rates, under Brender rejected another term of office of the chief-looking chief actors.
Therefore, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was eliminated.
Lastly, 35 lawyers had been mixed into the debate, which considered the process of Koch as constitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To Person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on 4 August 1957.
He studied politics, education and Romanistics.
Afterwards, he worked at the Southwest Television and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed to ZDF, first to "this day-journal".
Following stations: 1988-1990 personal referent of the Chief Actor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of ZDF External Policy; since the leader of the ZDF Main Town Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brender, which was still elected on Wednesday by the Medical Journal as a journalist of the year.
Kochs Against the Board of Directors, Rheinland-Palessian Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the Institution's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of partial politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Boards also excluded Beck.
Brender's anticipated successor Peter Frey had recommended the Management Board with a wise chess train - he strongly criticized the body immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both the sharks without loss of face for the positions of the chief actors and the Board of Directors without suspecting a participant in the office.
In the partial arithmetics, Frey is counted to the left-liberals.
Study Becoming Depressed
Participation for students: After a year of educational struggle, the ministers of the countries ended on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Cultural and High Schools Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their study in the future.
Individually, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with one single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Politics and universities are also seeking to facilitate the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to make common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
There should also be no country-wide schemes.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultural Ministers and Uni-Rektors have carried the plunged word of the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of tests drasticly: "Every module usually closes with only one test," it is stated in a 30-page paper which is intended to partially re-regulate the authorisation of study gangs.
With the "decisive reduction of the test load", the accreditation Council's chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, it was intended to offer a "defective development of content that significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be the "decisive criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content are "to be strictly checked afterwards" whether "unnecessary entrances of students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "required to have play rooms, allowing and promoting own initiatives".
The rules for the authorisation of new, but also for the review of existing courses should be applicable.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, however, which means that it will take until 2015 until all courses of study have been checked.
In this respect, ten accreditation agencies are bound to the accreditation Council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies so that the content of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In several federal countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the Ministry of Country on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rheinland-Pfalz gave additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are to set up, in particular, tutor programs and to strengthen study advice as well as testing and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to use ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010 the government is about to bring a novel of the High School Act into Parliament.
After this, only one test should be required for the completion of a study model.
The study design is to be more flexible, in addition, to ensure the recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to master.
By the end of the next year, all studies of the country are to be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again struggled on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups urged that the design of education policy should no longer take place "back closed doors" of Ministers and High Schools in the future.
At the latest after the educational stroke, students as concerned should speak "a word."
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Conference (HRK), Margret Winter Mantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a common reform paper.
The Federation of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to the Bond Decisions: it calls for a legal claim to allow each graduate with a Bachelor conclusion to access a further master study.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor Students in the morning is available with the best possible study conditions, says GEW Executive Member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to set a significant number of dozens.
However, the Ministers of Cultural Affairs did not express themselves to a more free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Income in Germany and out is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem of the Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language feet the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in the Romanian Banat in 1951, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a teacher in a child book publisher before he transferred to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessian literature forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
On the last Tuesday, he took care of considerable ex-literary supervision at a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and decoration of their securitate acts".
Söllner is visiblely unassured and declared a statement in which he was employed as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The advertising attempts had started swallowing, first 1971.
I'm, Söllner closed, "so someone who has not guarded enough against the intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The Lyrik Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Nearly at the same time as the Nobel Prize Honour for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary conflict with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and in particular the Community of the German authors coming from Romania is shaken by a case that makes the grounds and defeat of a political system based on monitoring and focusing.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say, not only actors, but also victims.
In his Securitate Agt, IM Walter played a role, said, after the consciousness of Söllner of the literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He threw him out in all the different points for him then, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in the form and was unexpected before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cosy reserve for Securitate spits, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own document, 914 pages.
The affected, so you may suspect, be speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the deck name Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
In contrast to the very procedural view of the Stasi acts, the management of the securitate monitoring is still very different.
A systematic disclosure has been undertaken and obstacles in recent years.
One of the Birthler Boards of the relevant National Council for the upgrading of the Securitate Acts (CNSA) was founded only in 1999, but the release of the acts has been more drowsing since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law governing the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate Chamber from Temesvar deliberately expressed himself on the priceholder.
She's got a Psychosis, finally, they've just been inquired once.
The infamy of power meant to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Surely, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with distorted debt, is inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has been damaged? The disappointed reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hope that the continuing of this chapter will be determined by the need for knowledge rather than by debt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation Attachment Champions League
It seemed like the new VfB Trainer Christian Gross, in conjunction with an orange plaster of the equipment, had distributed a quarterly hour after midnight into a called C class.
The man with the marking glacier was able to drive for the foreign city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not at last in the game, and sleeping for happiness was the 55-year-old.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just continues.
Or let's go right now.
In the words of the Swiss first three days earlier obliged: "We have reached the eight-final," the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves blind from the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "very more important task" is before Sunday.
Then it is true that in Mainz it is to repeat the kingly class performance in the League everyday.
And dispose of the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Drasch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Dispensation
The eight-final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/Replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) is released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminating conservation of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only the supposed healer who had communicated the unsured Stuttgarter Profis in the short period of time self-confidence, willingness to use and joy of play.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and have stopped them to be more courageous, declared the so simple sounding success recipe, which under the therapeut Babbel had no more effect.
He devoured a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes happens things that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's injury break, was the best player in the place, tried to describe the "phenic wind" and the working way of the new supervisor: "He's a man who takes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it was evident that it had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns Sports Chairman Horst Held
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs most of the most constance.
Like Gross, players and managers were guarding to overestimate the victory against a spared weakness and completely overrequired the defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came to mind Khedira.
And Horst Held Sports Chairman reminded that even though a seasonal target was achieved, the other was still in a further distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero was not after celebration for three months on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory, the events of the weekend, which were freshly experienced in the form of a TV interview direct before the start of the game by Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, contemporary heroes the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown leadership weakness and decided to change trainer on puberting fans.
Also that his free day after games had been deleted, Lehmann appreciated as signs of lack of sovereignty and misunderstood.
Lehmann's statements were "perfect by pure egoism", heroed back and announced the consequences for the final man.
They're probably not gonna be friends for life, the two forty years.
However, they agreed with all others that without preparing the work of the trainer team, the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large share of the success," said Herth and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic.
WM fight in gravity
Heating Duell in Bern: The Challenge Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Klitschko provoked again and again with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his gravity title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Champion in gravity.
The 38-year champion, according to the Verbandes WBC's version, was unanimously defeated by the U.S. American Kevin Johnson in Bern in the night for Saturday, according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
In the past, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. all expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 winners in 41 professional struggles, twice he had to be hit because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
The 2.02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, especially with his left leadership hand, about 17.000 people in the Berner Arena.
The 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duell, rehearsed the battle of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to come over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his struggle met the world champion only rarely.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some whirls before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hussian zombie", which "nothing can't be right."
During the weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to push Johnson the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and retrieved his "WBC belts" that he had to deliver before battleless.
In this year he rejected Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States at his title defense.
I only got a struggle in this fight and I'm physically very good in form, Klitschko had just found the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the Associations WBO and IBF.
But the belt of the WBA is wearing the British David Haye after he was able to throne the 2,13 meters big Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Accordingly, its promotional society is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Fall
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greenen-Fraction Manager Jürgen Trittin called Minister for Defence Guttenberg for false information on the customer business as a lie.
SPD and left require information from the office.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone a conscious deception.
The Minister said to the deadly Bombardement on two tank trains from September "insecurely the insecure," said Greenen-Fraction chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD message "dayssee".
It's called the countryside: he's lying.
The killing command had been issued under disregarding the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack was not only a destruction of the kidnapped trucks but also of killing two Taliban leaders targetly.
The U.S. Air attack requested by the German Kunduz-Kommandeur was killed or injured, according to Nato Survey Report, up to 142 people.
Greens, SPDs and left called on on Saturday Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Federal Day and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must explain whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and, if the office of offices, federal warrant and news service has approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin asked Renate for a short time.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
He said that the Office has not influenced the concrete actions of the Federal War in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised to the presentation of the Ministry on the backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the Tanklaster attack.
It was officially supposed that they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and held sensible details to the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they claimed that they had even pointed to the Defense Ministry on several reports, including a two-sided document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunting report.
In the meantime, Wichert has asked in a letter for clarification of the fact, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, says it.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the claims and pointed out that this was explained in the Federal Day Surveillance Committee, which wishes to construct on Wednesday.
dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychic sickness and in drug smoking, the limits between imagination and reality distort.
As long as it happens in the sleep, it's all right.
If we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we must dedicate inevitably the wildest ideas and fantasy figures.
But whoever experiences traumaous conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world is mostly considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as a special child.
However, such pictures and voices are not only present in psychic illness or in drug flavor.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make sure that the limits between dream, madness and reality distort.
Traum-like changes in watchconsciousness can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of misery.
Even though the triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mysticist Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Practices of Carlos Castaneda, shamanic depressivity, psychosis and hallucinations, can lead to similar processes.
Hallucinations or misconducts occur when the balance of the neuronal bone substances of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and disgusting thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic Psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of wrath and dream has been working philosophers and doctors since the ancient.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the guardful state, Wilhelm Griezinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrie, found in 1861 a "great similarity of misery with dreams", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was "a Psychosis, with all unreasonableness, misrepresentations, senses of such ones".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no more power over him, he's floating on the room deck.
He feels a trip.
Behind him flewd devil shapes with blood-red, distorted fractures, tennexing.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flaming steps, throw it against the walls, he feels the pains of the whole body.
Sound, bad voices from walls and radios.
He can't endure them anymore, the voices that embarrass him and insult him.
Henning T. screws two cables out of the cable, knocks them to a strike and attachs them to a cook on the ceiling.
He rises to a speaker and puts the strikes around the neck.
Jump.
The strike is loose.
This should be a teaching to you, crying the voices in thrombossed chorus, "Go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoide Psychosis, also it is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, the manie, the schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his disease, he's been married for three years.
In the psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deep desperation, he says.
The trug images are cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic Psychosis, affected people are usually no longer able to distinguish between internal and outdoor worlds, they are ratified in a superior state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer distinguish importantly from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is overflowed by impressions.
Like the dream, the Psychosis also opens the slices for a flood of ideas and fantasies, which produce deeper consciousness layers.
The reality in the Psychosis is subjectively centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the clinic for general Psychiatrics at the University Clinic Heidelberg.
The Shizophrene is located in the centre of the event, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he becomes, similar to in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Shizophren is therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balancing is usually not possible for them, the trug images are cruel reality, waking out.
Once in life a hallucination experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensible and spatial structure of reality that is observed in the Psychosis remains in principle."
The disgusting thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hits capriols, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality in each person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic approach to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solely determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, for example by a mother's virus disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery of how the disturbance of the neuronal system occurs, which is not initially manifested over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a Psychosis if the disposition is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychoses as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy is, psychiatrists suffer from their hallucinations and swallowing expensive medicines to get them away, others spend money for drugs to get those, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
It is often only a question of the view whether the pictures are felt as pleasant or unpleasant.
The box has been gathering reports about hallucinations and disturbances for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irresponsible world in our head".
Hallucinations include the typical accompanying appearances of Psychosen, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to psychic disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer and pedal brain tramatoes.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Hallucinations, such as box, are composed of memory content that are usually retained.
They arise when the brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or a Psychosis.
But just likewise riding, stress, love shakes or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life have experienced hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may occur that a narrow boy with long, dark hair speaks to it.
If it answers him, the students look surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shocking girl is a sponsored day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the kid.
I'm crazy? She sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other trug images are not real and disappear again.
In the evening, the appearances are most alarming
Often the trug images are also a burden.
If she sits in the classroom, she can't follow the teaching material at times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just imagining a new teacher while explaining to all others hearing and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are most distressing.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bloody cutting wounds on arms and legs, appear before her open or closed eyes.
Let me alone, she'll scream the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they would think they'd be crazy.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She lived with her friend last year.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from riding, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suppose the brain's under-occupied, and I'll take care of his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl was afraid of other children, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 years of age that the man she calls father since she can think is not her physical father.
Since in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for affected people like Sarah K. to distinguish trug images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also pictures that cause the brain to originate, so they act so real."
Also nightly dream pictures consider box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not vary fundamentally from those of an acute Psychosis.
Unlike schizophrens, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their trug pictures as irregular.
The box therefore advises his patient to assess the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border condition between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too consciously centered world imaginary experience is mostly pathologyized, Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the Clinic for Psychiatric and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A Psychosis is a severe, suffering illness, but it also offers positive, creative - cruel is also a artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumatically modified guard consciousness.
Oneiroides are high-complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experience thinks it is real and which he cannot distinguish from the guard state in the afternoon.
The oneiroide consciousness state arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motoric paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete incapacity of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the real situation is reproduced in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense and meaning in an incomprehensible situation that enables people their own design ability to not intervene in a non-conscious loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zürcher Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as the rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiovascular surgery with subsequent heart transplantation takes place for days on trips, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen pops into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedside, old man, on board a train laboratory, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among audiences that produce noise from blood.
Slepping from a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, surfing with its Spital bed in the company of the Alps and hiting a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined thing, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels differ fundamentally from any dream for claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travels are more clearly for me after years and in extraordinary details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the Psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, Oneiroide, Psychosen, hallucinations and drug smoking shows how brutal our inner pictures of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in consciousness, the psychologist resumes the box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be richer.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children are to take the publisher with 27 years of age
The new publisher Kallen is a intermediate solution: In the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
Holding is also supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children inherited with 27 years of age and have the strong will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said the SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question is whether they are active in the company only afterwards.
The question also is whether they are able to do so.
You cannot present 7500 employees to his children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawn from the chair of the Board of Directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old callen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's capabilities and after the excretion of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finances.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the settlement.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to overcome "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also be one of 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the cases of Schicksal and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family companies are not sure before the decline: "It was always true of families who were inclined by a capital quest who had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very large player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no world power dreams, so Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the worldliga with 'Time', these shops have become too large.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, located in the eighth floor, you can find among other considered companies, such as Hedonai, who provide an entrance with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and for beauty treatments; the friseurs Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that shows through her tea house with more than 130 different tea species.
To enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glazing champagne, these are only some of the many possibilities that Spaxion offers.
The total surface is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments and for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this type of devices, and there are also virtual trainers who care for the customer's training units and thereby offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen that is located against the devices.
Then shows you various videos how to do your training units correctly.
The leader of the fitness study ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and decoration) are perfectly sufficient to train the muscles of the body.
And then, after you have trained your body, still want to overlook the friseur salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room in which treatments for the recovery of hair practitioner, glance and health are offered for your hair in personalized ways.
Innovation and exclusiveity seems to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 a.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse Decolletés
Christmas moves closer and therefore it is a good opportunity again to copy the appearance of the stars and to get their festive clothes in our clothes.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that need to be taken into consideration.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complex decolleté.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The Endsa power company created the "LIVE-Büro" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalan.
The "LIVE-Büro" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and meet agreements on mobility by managing, coordination, subsidy, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed for the promotion of electric cars and opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to move forward the means of transport in the future.
3 "electrical cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The Electricity Company Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities that are related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not at all the only initiative that endsa is taking part in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a Horizon of Rest" for the automotive sector
President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesying the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a Horizon of Rest".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economy Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded of the measures that the government started to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Unless the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today would have a panorama of negligence and the closure of some of our main production works," said the Government President.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain, we can see a quiet horizon for the award of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers that, in turn, provide more than 3 billion euros for investment.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to encourage demand, in view of the 2000E plan, which will apply in cooperation with the autonomous communities and the automobile manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% in average, which led to a "growthful growth" in the authorisations that increased by "40%" in November.
On 20,000 square metres classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-stop: Environmental sport
Mazda wants to prove that sportsity is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 emerges by its good notes at the overall image.
The final processing, the operation of the vehicle, the comfort, its behavior, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomie and good hold.
The game of the drive is also excellent.
For further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futurist inner design with a variety of buttons and switches in the look-up colors red and blue.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
That is why it can be said that both Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, will be removed from the proximity of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to overcome.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort so that four adults can ride too comfortably with the car.
All of this comes to a largely spacious and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and drive system is currently only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-gang ceiling.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It stirs through its fineness, through its quiet noise, its performances and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its large comfort in walking and its low consumption, even when Mazda is mostly the diesel models that are most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive is a speciality for the sampling, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The serial elimination is mainly the assistant for the change of the trailer (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner levels, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chrome 17 inch.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it was not enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable bixenon lighters and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who do not reside many kilometres per year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2,000 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is a little high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euro for the test-driven model Sportive.
However, as a counter to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest passport.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes of reputation when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is especially of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of a iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about EUR 12 a month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to avoid all the data to read their emails as soon as you cross the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or an interconnection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly deductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but after my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission on compulsory roaming tariffs for Europe was almost always unobserved.
You are always afraid of reading your e-mails and that rightly.
That a small device like FonPeek (which it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no WiFi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone providers must slowly, but safely reconsider and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example for it, in its prices it is to download books and further requests on the Internet.
Without voyage and without hackes.
It is an Internet-capable device and it is only one time to pay for it, namely at purchase, and not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a purchase possibilities with lifelong Internet access as it's already offering the Peek in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails with the phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I believe that it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At Barack Obama's office as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a mantel of this color and have chosen the same colour again to accompany him with his, no doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the peace noble price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried very similar models at both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a glancing green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and mantle from the same substance, and thereby wearing a little largely sticked or a necklace.
It is even so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturia and decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of fabric they are manufactured from.
During the introduction, she had a dress of top and in Oslo of a patterned seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-height paragraphs and for the second time a final model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was stuck up at this occasion as a hair crane, during the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of the occupational mothers have had problems in work because of their maternity
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want children.
This result is the study "Fruchtability and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey under 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of the occupational women see their career in the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women are working or not, and if yes, what kind of occupation they do.
Those of those who do not do any other work in the house only work half-days or have no firm working contract will be more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women have a firm job, especially in the public sector, to move the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group aged between 35 and 49 years with a fixed job get their first child in average only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a firm employment, which have needed longer to achieve this and which have worked together and the first child has only achieved a lot later.
In addition, the type of work also has a large influence on the motherhood, even though less than the calendar regarding the reception willingness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is much higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also detected in women in the same age.
For example, the women in the group were between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they only had the primary graduation or higher education, at average at 25.1 or 32.1 mothers for the first time.
Moreover, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women are already married with a main conclusion before their first establishment and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation are doing exactly different and are looking for a festival and marrying after it and then get their first child, Delgado establishes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to the list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The main publisher of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous cover, like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who joined this exclusive club were allowed to actors Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
The cosmetic company also has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkollege von Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak with in the fashion world.
Your highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual price award held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the three-sized X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He uses not a predictable and fearful influential genre (kort biography, life and work), but seeks an awfulness for the glowing heartpiece of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent is not saving any fears or lighting.
Auβer that this book is a delicious readegenus, it is also a moving call for reading and reading again and again.
Here are some cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost meaningful tribulation, as I always felt, without having found words: the joy in contrast to the unhealthful fate, the moral without debt and the innocentness without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgorian Christ, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between uncertainty and insight, with a poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife rings that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that persisted for thirteen years, who moved into her ban, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into the heavens on the way to corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world's literature, one must climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best mountain climbs are repeatedly trying again."
About William Faulkner: "There was a funny cauz.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a covenant owner of the covenant, and again, he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams proved to be a certain grey."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would go deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary manner. He made this on a journey on which he flew before himself and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeed and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave, these verses are engraved by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a seated life you will find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag, she always had her depressions with her.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII spioned her between the Azales or the birds sang in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a Neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greyer than her crazyness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos otherwise than trying to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do when he did not introduce Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man's fame, so that he could put himself on this podest?"
Feeful Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age lived next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer that we picked out of the animal home and weighed just six kilos, and then they missed him two footsteps and hurt him hardly.
Our disappointment cannot be taken in words, because it is impossible to understand, where the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which has been carried out on the line, is obviously unacceptable.
This is still the incredible attack that a woman who walked cozyly received when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared her own life, because if such an indignant attacks a dog, he may be the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normal quiet district at five o'clock afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog wept all day long.
Of course, we have made an ad in a nearby police department, but we have a great doubt about whether it will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we only want to clarify that the fine criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament over the event has led us to show this incident.
We can't understand what needs to happen in the heads of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for the animals and the individuals remained.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign for the promotion of helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to make attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is finally the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of an engine wheel accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport security, which "which is far more than only the design and manufacture of products that are increasingly safer with each day," and further confirmed that it also contributes to the development of this goal with other actions of educational and information.
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, running under the Slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first phase to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because they are always compulsory as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, which one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small load cars increases a bit again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see a little light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in reference to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, the figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the autodealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be used with great caution, since the reference data used to compare from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a fall of 60 % in respect of the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months still remain 40 % below the sales numbers of the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles from which the small transport market consists are included: departures of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter smaller cars/cars.
In addition, the same clouds in the sky are still the same, which are most compassionate, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the large part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, who in nearly 100 % of the cases do the purchase with a third-country financing.
For these restrictions, which are the result of the counterfeited penalties of the credit institutions, it is necessary to include further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the duration of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped in buying a vehicle of the plan 2000E little.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small companies, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions which may not exceed 160 grams per mile drive, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded us that it is essential for the state to focus on these small loaders as well as on industrial vehicles (last cars and buses).
The trader association prophesys a similar year for 2010 as the last year, for which it calculates a sale loss (for passenger cars and terrain cars) of 19 %.
The support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now required
As the anti-blocker braking system ABS at that time, and as it is just happening with the ESP stability control, the aid systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars for braking in emergency cases.
In fact, they are already obliged to all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a period of carriage until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims at improving the protection of the fugitives, but these braking systems can also help prevent many injury accidents because of their functioning.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre, which recognizes the system on the brakespedal based on the brake strength exported by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation undertaken by the Bosch vehicle component manufacturer, one third of the drivers in an accident was no longer able to enter the brakespedal and half of them had not braked with full power.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, takes maximum power into the brake system and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car returns when braking is done.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1.100 fatal accidents in which fugitives are damaged could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would even be fewer accidents - one is expected that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognizes obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerts a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brakespedal if necessary.
If the driver is not responding to the warning and even if the convergence is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the occupation of the Opel Work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer suggests that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of the GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already agrees on each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, first presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of saab will be taken in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American autobuilder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper transport cars, which has back coverage from the Russian Converg group, is growing.
If there should be no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the boxster S as a basis, but they really made it easier to make it 80 kg, and now only 1,255 kg to the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they first avoided the automatic unfoldable roof that was replaced by a tentlein wall roof with manual drive, so that one alone was spared 21 kg; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, like the GT3 "sweeping" further 15; by removing the air conditioning system again 13 times; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that further 7 kilos were stored; by the installation of sportal bacquet seats again 12 times and with the light 19-told fields, five more.
Then, because of the absence of the CDR-30 audio system, six kilos were again less and by the exchange of door handles from fabric, the missing kilograms were reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK double-coupling drive, the test drive was carried out with a 6-cursive hand-driven vehicle, mainly on the smaller land-roads of California, on mountain lines that truly leverage very curved.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the note tadellessly.
However, the reduction of his weight has never resulted in the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the street.
It is rather the opposite of the case: we have since long not tried a small and light model, which, at the same time, also gives you a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete to make his muscles warm at a low walk in the necessary time until we give him the commands to rush, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you say to him. The car does everything we inspire him with our hands at the wheel, thanks to his leadership, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavors
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been excellently successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise that has already been used at Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, regardless of whether it stands out or re-accelerates.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landstraßen, on which we drove with the boxster Spyder, was quite damaged, but the car mastered the sludges well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that, although we found ice at some of these curves in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultraslight car, a car with which you have an indescriptive passport, as it may be rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Coco Coco Cocooon cosmetic line and an occasional starry at the maison views of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same throat strength as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated Fuβball field of Maccabi Electra and thus came to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant outcomes of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and team work, even if they were to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great matches from the perimeter out with 16 evaluated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game started with the leadership of the blue reds, which sat from the beginning to the top on the display table.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to announce that they had come to the field with well-heated hands.
It was English and Teletovic, mostly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play a inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with puffs and applaus, which is his home to further develop its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of splitter already admits that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the macabes wanted to remind the Vitorians again that on their field, not everyone wins, and thanks to the ever-advantaged "Hand of Elías" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning the rope (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured but everything other than dead, had to prepare a couple of tracks with meeting security to get air again, and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive three times and with the support of English and Ribas, made it possible for the reconsuming distance from (54-67) on the advertisement table to be shown at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anybody to take away the victory they earned in the first three-third minutes honestly.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their teams, and tried to give their team back by three points from the line (70-77).
Yet, and although splitters were placed from the place because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defend themselves well and although the Israelites still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the group B of Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game marked by the outbreak of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at the interior game, which made the Greeks easier to win.
The malaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or before the opposing team, which may be one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host blinded with 12-18 in the 9 minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it possible that the advertisement table showed their favors in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it had come to beat between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and his superiority on both game halfs, while the excretion of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left significant traits at Unicaja.
Under their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with its three-fold, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A champion was impossible
The third play quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be overwhelming and even made it possible to compensate for the difference of the game that was carried out in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minute, which brought the leadership into swings within the group.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many outbreaks and the excretion of the shots injured during the game, Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the threefold of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope for 66-57 came back.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos was not to brake as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centuries within the basket area.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in the 37th minute to allow the basket difference to rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be struck and had to stop the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
The Facebook users can now learn their salary, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most displays of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should deserve because of their profile.
The tool "How much should you deserve?" calculates the user's salary on the basis of more than 140.000 job offers that are available at Trovit in Spain. Users are available a form in Facebook where they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "sickly paid", explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid, according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmerer receives an annual gross level of EUR 45,226 and a French 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 that a Spanish man deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is the net of a cellar with EUR 11.592 per year; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and the worker with EUR 15.667.
The most searched posts in the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a departure date
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 when his mandate is officially expired.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Hunduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo television broadcaster that "Mel" knows that before that date he had found the message in which he had been found since September 21, asylum.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, as his mandate runs on this day and he needs to search for a new accommodation."
The transmitter also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the return of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which Porfirio Lobo became a winner) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried this week to have a refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed to refuse Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum seeking politician who wanted him to force the "de facto" government under the chair of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most attractive days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant atmosphere on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising, since this is its natural condition, in an environment where the makers make decisions about a natural uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity to be free of indirectly at interest rates moving around zero, so that the banks buy assets to calculate.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets is as well ended and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, starts to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE had already done with its annual increase, the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in business bonuses are rising again, even though they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state the private risks and to increase government debts again.
You are now resettled to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred refugee of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the euro area countries in relation to Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision on the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to the defendants of the moral risk that once again tried to reduce the limitation of loans to loss of jobs in the world economy policy responsible for what they had caused, since they would have reduced a new day of thanks to action.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that dismisses government debt, elections and a new government, which draws the same strike.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sokrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary will save from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a Euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for autumn-like measures to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected before a episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excessive amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonus.
However, if the European differences were reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, then there would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the present preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and correct their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, promises all that despite warnings, not a long lifetime.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although it is currently called "Paution on driving".
Connected branches
The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, took place first yesterday before the Parliament's subcommittee, where in these days Spain' energy supply strategy is debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, subject to the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this would not be the case, the necessary investment would not be up to 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that investment should be made not more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
As far as 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal works with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW is needed more, under the prerequisite, of course, by other "supporting" schemes.
Galán, who believes that the draft legislation for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in line with what his company demanded, in no case wanted to say anything against this law, such as incentives to create national carbon consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "there is a long-term distinction on this direction, despite some" individuals" steps taken, as she called the Chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it like it, Galán believes that now you should make decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, because it will need some time and need to create a stable compensation framework to take them into account.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports at the ground, the Swiss Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu Society Aer Lingus for the baggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, has been set up at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation for the creation of a Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments from 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the examination of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometers long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to set up in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city management wants to have completed the building at the end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English shortcoming) has decided to advance the project after a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and wall office management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion), competing in the last phase three consortia, especially from European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is referred to by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is seated in Italy, one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the Northern Direct consortium is established from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues Construction Group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, created from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the daughter company of the German construction company Hochdjup, which is part of ACS), also the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privateizations, however, has an obstacle to overcome, since only the purchase of a local construction company is engaged in.
A strategy that has been followed by the abovementioned companies, high-powered or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance for the sector in which it is already known because of its activity as energy provider and in the dissolution industry.
In addition, it has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria already and leads to the group of companies who were assigned to build and manage the Adelaide dissolution facility with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground wall line, which is promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the name of Northern Link (Northern Representator), aims to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the refugee trail in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels, which is the largest measure of the stairdown on the streets of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the city management provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this wall line is already intended to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in every direction, an electronic wall system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is involved in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a large business.
Australia forgives on high depth, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, repeatedly considerable contracts.
The ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with a glass fiber cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400 000 people and occupy the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and the higher depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools at 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has made its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2,1 kilometers long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64,5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the grant for construction work to extend the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) more than 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The beginning of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore, over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, informed the railway company.
This Treaty also provides the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which were presented to this competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the end, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be assigned to the design and production of campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom due to the excursion of competition.
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros to punishment since 1994 because of the disability of their competitors.
The penalty charged yesterday was even increased, since the authority guarding the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and therefore has relapsed.
Trade in application
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trade page on the Internet to increase revenues that do not result from the telephone connection.
This website of application of Orange is essentially active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this employment will also be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476,4 million.
The Champions League has developed its development in 1992 as a source of revenue for the Fuβball club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of Fuβball clubs that have earned most money in the League.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of UEFA, brings not only praise. It is also one of the main sources of the large associations.
According to the UEFA, up to 5.362.5 million euros have been distributed to the 105 teams (of which are 12 Spanish), which have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is located at the third place of Europe, who earned most money by its participation and who, next to the AC Milan, the only one who won the Trophee three times.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former Europecup in 1992 are the fifth place.
The list shows Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money by their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, although they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third place of the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated financial allocation procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini has entered, calculates revenues of 1.090 million through the Champions League.
The UEFA sets out 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 Fuβball clubs who participated in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who struggled with participation received 3.8 million through their very presence, in addition to the EUR 550.000 for each game they struggled.
There is also a bonus for winners (80,000 euros) and for a disagreement (40,000 per team). The clubs that have arrived in the eighteenfinals receive three million each; the four who have come to the quarterly finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a Fuβball club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned are still available.
This money will be allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 places allocated.
The last year's master receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has made details about the purchase of shares in yesterday, with which it wants to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos capital.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid to ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos-Actiens closed with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives the shareholders a deadline of 15 days to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructur its management.
In the attempt to stay at the edge of possible purchases and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the leader of the internal book review.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is all but free from polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspected redirection of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that it moves further capital over the next months.
With regard to the loan of the Salazar yesterday, the Ex-Beraters Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (Representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion invitation of Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The National Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paternina last 9 October.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this tender after being demonstrated that the conditions comply with the laws and thus the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, following the amendments made last 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also informed that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is 8.95% of company capital, composed of 6.142.786 euro in shares authorised at the carriages of Madrid and Bilbao.
It has also been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the tender is completed and their price was fixed in accordance with the legal laws.
New vehicles monitoring programmes
In these days of disadvantages and accidents, KFZ works are not only deserving
Every day thousands of vehicles that have been involved in an accident are dropped into the workshops where a consultant has to evaluate the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complex task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20 000 and 30 000 euros by hand, including the parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
Consequently, almost 100% of the advisors use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and maintenance collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing on the tool market for monitoring and drawing up a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is all other than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperated, each of them provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasingly high until the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engineering came to the market than in the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work starts for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because each of the but thousands of vehicles must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model generates a "intelligent" graphics on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If it is a very sold model, the work may be completed in a week if the procedure is accelerated quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can last up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with full information.
For example, among the exclusive models they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the roadside vehicle park, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists for mechanics) working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the preparation of these databases.
Every month they take up 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use them in different ways and thereby offer different products.
The most frequent use is the use for repairs and repairs, but according to country there are also tools for managing scratches or for calculating the error or rest value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of the cars used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but for it in the United States.

This tool is paid for each advice, depending on the purpose of use.
The most expensive will be used for customers who rarely use it ten times a month, namely EUR 5.75 per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company, who makes thousands of advice, negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape using the driver number.
AudaGlas is dealing with the vehicle disks, and AudaSubastas is an open service in the Internet to offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, the implementation of geodemographic analyses or for the purpose of obtaining information about the variations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be involved in a certain period of accidents due to pannens in the workshop.

However, the historically valued cars may be re-approved even if they have been logged out after difficult authorities.
Cost estimates of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching the replacement part, making and making a cost estimate.
The light handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older experts who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger motor vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the repair model has been identified using the driving position number, a graphic of the model appears and then the replacement part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, charges or discounts, and then it can print the cost estimate and forward to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool to review such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workplace targeted does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is EUR 350 per year, an amount that the customer can pay without any further.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working on offering these pictures in a three-dimensional format.
It is an innovation that has been waiting for the automechanics for a long time, because, for example, you can select a door with it and then turn the image completely to view the inside side.
