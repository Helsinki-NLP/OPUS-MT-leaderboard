Triumph of legal populations in Austria, totally 29%
Following the first preliminary results, the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday to Austria, a significant weakening of both parties of the large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal population parties.
In particular, the Austrian Volkspartei (ÖVP) suffered losses, where the position of the previous Chairman Wilhelm Molterer stands seriously on the kip.
In contrast, the president of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Staatschef Jörg Haider, is responsible for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the votes strongest in the country, but compared to the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cuts off, losing by 25.6 percent almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian postwar history, and especially in the people who had demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had come out of the coalition, the Volkspartei had a clear precedence before the SPÖ.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible withdrawal of the party Chairman and the former Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case on Monday at an exceptional meeting of the Board of Parties.
Such developments would probably lead to the most likely way out of the electoral debtor, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal populations - the Freedoms (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the populists agreed (then the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 she split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even resulted in sanctions from the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who already said he was willing to cooperate with each party and goes from return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party, which suffered light losses and interrupted among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place, took part in Parliament.
There is no other party who has probably lost the four-percent door and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were charged in India for the illegal collection of bugs, it could, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, come to a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister in New York stressed this after the present meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, it comes to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, in judicial matters the executives could only intervene hard.
Despite all, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released by the accusation and received a penalty, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of freedom punishment, it would be the best of Mukherdshi's view if he went in a higher instance.
He could so request release for security and wait in freedom for his judgment, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner has spoken as well in negotiations.
"He recommends a call at a higher court, then he would be in question of a contempt," said the Chief of the Czech diploma.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to allow the condemned "competent legal support" to be ordered, the Indian minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such aid is already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Blackenberg.
At the same time, he confirmed, as the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic considers the issue of the Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Ministers dealt with.
"I was already promised a lot," he only stated.
A Czech is directing the ring around the ground of the sea
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also to the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, which is one of the 30-heading staff teams of the UN division for oceans and maritime rights.
His boss, the Division Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it to and forward.
Workelan and enthusiasm are here.
The ground of the sea has a very little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, the further arch and other non-advantaged raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
The landscapes today reported their right to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in 1982 on Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred miles far from the shore of a country to the sea.
This country, according to the Convention, is exclusively entitled to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed as a continental shelf is considered the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the coastal sea, often also the limit of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the appropriate country of the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental plan must be based on a comprehensive scientific-technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now only the three last-mentioned countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
On an international echo recently the success of Australia, which, as the first country, could significantly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was granted by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square miles [6 km], which is about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that in the future leads to them from the use of the sea floor, as they promise, will have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also progressively submit their requests.
You can do this for ten years from the moment when you ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as "common inheritance of mankind".
Here's no state in a special position.
The right to promote in this field gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"The ground of the sea is not a gold graveland," meant with some excessor director Mikulka and adds that "their individual areas are legally defined and the system contractually enclosed".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other countries of the former eastern block within the framework of the Joint Organisation for Interocean Metal.
In 1991, as well as the investors of some less other countries, they received the status of a so-called "way-breaking investor".
The organisation has the right to promote in the zone of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is a little larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"You can support there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetallic concretions containing Nickel, Copper, Cobalt and Mangan", says another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a little potato or, with some fantasy, of the magnificent shame that the legend raised to life after the Golem.
German special forces were in the case of hostile liberation on site
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostile crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
In the circumstances of liberation of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are known.
Indirectly, according to the Defence and Interior Ministry, German special forces were involved in the rescue action.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Federal War and officials of the GSG 9 were the pilot pillar of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Work at the Place of Liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the Ministry continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to engage in it as local support forces.
"Happyly it has not come to this," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
An attackers had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and her eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostels in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Tsjaad were dropped and dropped.
The identity of the hostage holders remained unclear until the last time as well as the details of liberation or possible redemption payments.
The rescued ones have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostels are in the guard of the German message.
He did not express himself to details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the five holidays and the special forces are to be flown out with a Airbus of the Air Force and arrived on Tuesday in Germany.
U.S. Representative House rejects the rescue package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package for the financial markets very hardly failing.
The Dow Jones ran into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the government's savings package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be reduced to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the prosecutors desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
Reasons were the concerns of the investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, to then, after the failure of the failure, again crash.
Experts are now expecting further heavy turbulencies on the international financial markets.
It is necessary for the programme to enter into force, both the House of Members and the Senate.
Organizers indicate rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, the turnover compared to the previous year, according to a study, has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the travellust of the Germans remains unreasonable in a study.
In the winter season bookings, rice offices reported a sales plus of 31 percent compared to the previous year period, as the German travel association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, the booking figures already have been increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover plus of the travel offices for October was about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV communicated.
The basis for these results is the figures of the GfK, which evaluate monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and high for the whole market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were made.
Because of the weak dollar price, travels to the United States were especially asked, the DRV informed.
This is about a third of the booking growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic targets of the Germans were particularly asked.
In particular, Pauschal travels are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "for customers better calculated than for individually organised vacation".
Money could save consumers through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Also the summer months had been very well booked, so that a turnover plus will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although, according to a further study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer of liter-crowds and promis in designer-Dirndln.
It's a wheat debut.
Susanne and I don't have much common.
She's blonde, TV-moderator and wears a customised dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: Soon three minutes on the wheat, already the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very smooth and that at my first wheat visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap-Dirndl seems to meet its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Worqueror, well-being remained in limitation to date.
But first arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everybody wears dirndl or leather cheese; no one looks responsive or painfully touches - everything completely normal.
Strange sights at the chocobanan scene only harvest my dirdle screws.
A coiner makes me aware that I would have tied the curbs wrongly: "Lefts high free, middle virgin, forgive right, wedding back."
Homely, I freeze the loops from back to left.
"Pass," it said and laughed.
Others make less efforts for subtle flirt techniques and wear light filthy shields, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches a unbetened backwards against the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attituses is Bob, comes from England and visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn ooooo.
He tells me that after he has finished his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks he's a wastehouse.
So Bob is one of these famous "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the happiness of losing alcohol in this way.
By 8:00 a.m., sanitations run in crowds over the festival place that needs to take care of the poor suckers.
Hospital careers always appear in the rule - always four at once drag a conceived tragedy from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, fully back.
You don't see who's in the Promille Sarg under the plane.
"These are the ones where the gornifier packs," called one of the sanitarys on request and disappeared in the cabinet.
Name of the victim of accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female coacher who died in the hospital after it was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident due to the suspicion of mild driving.
In the meantime, he was released to security.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey endeavored to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deeply into Turkey's backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed, ceased effort.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel leaders tell you.
The building sits ridiculously at the end of the railroad with a tower on each corner of the front and looks like any provinceal German Councilhaus.
The rock is terrible.
The whole building breaks around
But once you are within the woven ticket switch, there is no doubt about the achievement of the project, whose western access this was.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late trainer in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damaskus, Bagdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist project embraced during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and its Arabians.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the inevitable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Station.
In 1917, an ammunition train fled into the air, and the artificial roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly broken, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatolien and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic Horizon of Turkey.
The Government of Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a approach policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the core data of this new foreign policy, I went the night to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on glazing that produced the equivalence of the ancient world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered as a new city for the new worldly government projects to return to the back of the Osmanian past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has resulted in some distrusts in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the headquarters of the ACP, a specially manufactured, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing pre-town, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and knees in which the middle manager in clothing, both men and women, met to finish the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress, Krawatte, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional appearance," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from her backland.
Today, she has to look at East and West at the same time.
There's not either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both of them.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "does not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point, which almost everybody I spoke with here, almost routinely said: the relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally advantageous for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, can, in transferred sense, travel Europe as a whole on just rail rails eastwards towards Asia and Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's railway station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr Ritter and Mr. Conu who had been watching the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too widely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the station for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In the memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962 Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Core.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, next year.
He was intended for youths up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) was for the willingness and ability of the Chores, any music that was presented to him to attack whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical violentness of such a young chore was often amazing, always exciting and consisted alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never persisted over years.
How often death kept us "to let music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it's singing!"
His kind of conduct was absolutely clear and precise, never glorious, but never overwhelming.
Whatever the musical level was high, he always demanded a higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any dirigent had to be hit to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years, I have written criticism for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modestness.
He abhored the dirigents, according to his words, simply "with one or two known sculptures in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he took over the education of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Study in 1950... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author comment in Woodruff's book "Besides Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman Stipendium, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to exchange this part of his course.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me careful about them because of their lightness and because of the power they exhibit, how they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of outstanding sales at Honda.
In November, Honda is captured with the marketing of the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-space limousine offers a much greater.
This also includes the technical units that enable even more comfortable driving and preserving petrol.
Changes before the future revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new Jazz shows a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism will be stressed.
Yet, before you start analyzing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, created to renew this model for shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in relation to its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about a half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows the sales recession in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this sales increase, Honda increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda focuses on the appearance of a new model.
It is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the internal space is also enlarged.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the suitcase space, which has a system of double charging, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation cargo space.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1,4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the honda Jazz suitcase with a 1,2-liter benzine engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of building panorama windows, an improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of his marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the petrol engines: 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, while at the same time bringing torque power for the entire motor cycle.
The first variant with 1,2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
"Auto-Biene" that avoids collisions
To promote development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, of the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight comes back to the swarm bee behaviour and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the University of Technology of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, every bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan Safetychild.
But the most important is the facet eye of bees, which can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted into their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to imitate the Round Perspectives, the technicians developed the laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are located in distance from BR23C up to two meters in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a boardy microprocessor, which is translated directly into signals for the prevention of collision
`In the moment when obstacles are noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this escape is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the manager of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not vary upwards or downwards, but also not overcover; it can only move to two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only requires every couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the manovers made, so it can continuously work with only a couple of thousands of KBs of memory.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about GBs and not even the MBs of the space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesys in serial cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than the diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the goal and avoid the obstacles on the way.
She's on the scratch before it's loaded with a hypothectic.
It must be realized that the United States Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of US citizens in hypothesis stories of the supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game has been developed for Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', says it.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the intersection.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no loan.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a side for the teenagers than a place for all the viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to their company, which would be the first bank in Japan that will spend $9 billion and thus take 21% of their capital, a new one that is due to a strong case of their exchange course.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley stamps at a uniform price of 25.25 dollars, resulting in a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the rate of the share from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee you a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, which is 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 7.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more careful attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed during the last days: Last Monday Morgan had clearly explained that it would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, director of the MUFG, we thought that participation would consist entirely of tribal shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce and secure the risks.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley share.
And the business will go away with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into stock shares if the latter will be exchanged to more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities to strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to make a payment capacity of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared his balance since the end of August `explicit'.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insurance against payment incapacity speeded up to the height.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivors of the large investment banks at the Wall Street after the banking of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic rebuilds about socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equator Rafael Correa.
The third party, following this Sunday, the example of his equals and friends, made the plan for a new constitution.
Mission is fulfilled because, according to the 80% of the voters' votes, 64% voted with 'Yes' in the national vote.
According to these results, 28% voted with ‘Non’, 7% of the electoral list were invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, more than half of the votes given must be reached.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out on the exits of the election sites and a counting of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for `Yes' and predicted 63% to 70%.
In the evening of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution triumphed in overwhelming way', he had convinced in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his chilenian similar Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the Observatory of the United States Organisation (OAS) was based on a text consisting of 444 points for the protection of the 'new socialism' for which the President is taking place.
The Constitutional Project transfers the government's violence to the economy by passing it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and by the devises who send immigrants to the country.
The project, forwarded by the Correa chosen in 2006, also confesses greater power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of each four years and will have the possibility to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living in 50% of the population below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial support point as a starting station for American anti-drug interventions.
The 19 hostels were released in the Chad
A Egyptian command started the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the wilderness for 11 days, were brought back healthy and unconceived to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in the Chad.
Apparently in good condition, at 15.30 a.m. on board a special plane reached the military base point al-Maza right next to the international airport of Kairo.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Kairo, to be studied on board a helicopter.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers were not paid a ransom', explained the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After she was captured on September 19 at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought out of 35 unknown kidnappers from one hide.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency of Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
A Egyptian safety officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, the attack at night, started shortly before the morning dam.
"On both sides, fires fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fleeing," said this responsible who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini explained of Belgrade, where he is right now, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special units played.
"We must recognise that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also fails that a ransom was paid.
In the past evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a land vehicle with a patrol, where the kidnappers were, of which they were six, including the leader from the Chad, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, they were connected to the movement Libération du Soudan Unité (SLA-U), which immediately struggled with this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is a listing and is a key topic of the current electoral struggle.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up and cry up the harmful sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are hungry?
What politicians will dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as well as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of Chinon's castle in the Loiretal?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the Quebec history companies, at least 40.000 honorable officials, gathered in 211 stories, are trying to deal intensively with the history, to save the numerous private archives with a few larges, and to receive the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the force of desperation, when contributors and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten gardens.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which are undergoing the US financial crisis in Turbulencies, are to take part in the arms of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank: The three countries provide a total of EUR 11,2 billion to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also established in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level in the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank could have a preliminary characteristic.
For the purpose of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank for about 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell a part of its shares, all the insurance activities previously purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis have started a steady valley last week, in which the second half of the week already took serious crisis scenarios.
However, analyzers agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a Pleite.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since Jänners, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, but is unrealistic according to its management.
According to the management, the USD is 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is debted by the Talfahrt of the Fortis acts.
On Monday, however, the courses were slightly rising.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed a new Director-General of the Bank.
The funding institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found a stakeholder with a business offer.
The Belgian government, however, was strived to calm down - no investor is supposed to be crushed for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers until now, the branches of the bank have not been crashed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has separate branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in Hühnerstall
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could be uncontrolled.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of drug data to the consent of the affected person in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fuchs the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developers of the program for the follow-up of recipe data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and payment amounts in the event of damage depending on the customer’s health status and, if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance will not be completed.
Earlier, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only completed in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years by the pharmacies, speaks what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what the client's disease is suffering and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly purchases large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, it was found that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically rank into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplyer, so that insurance needs to make more of the paper crochet, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraine and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers' view, while the above not.
For the inquiry and processing of the data, its own companies have formed themselves, which, before they refer to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although discontinuations have not yet been accomplished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and connect them with the data on drug consumption. They provide an even more precise picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for health data, its impact is only on healthcare providers and insurance services.
The draft legislation has already been submitted to the Congress that the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his programme so that the data can be transmitted only with the agreement of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly fail to access his data, since insurance does not conclude any contract with him otherwise.
And so the chickens are only rightly left somehow the grace of the fog.
Global food plan from Marseille
The European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main topic in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit, which is discussed mainly on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector, is also taking place.
Although the European Union recognises that India is a prominent, democratic great power that should be given more votes and right to speak in international matters, the Member States have not yet agreed whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis at the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the nineth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and the current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was concluded to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to EUR 100 billion.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also legally summarised into an agreement, so that air traffic will also be frequent in the future.
India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the partner number one of India, New Delhi is only on the rank of nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
These were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism which both sides were most condemned, and the calling for a UN Conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, both sides are guilty of failure.
The EU stressed that it maintained its energy and climate programme, i.e. the reduction of pollution emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a type of global compromise and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050, as well as with the proposal to conclude at the next climate summit.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the calling for an international conference on the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of Government visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
However, in Paris, orders to French companies are expected to be worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to reports by the Agency, the Agreement is to be adopted at 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Buchmesse.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right acquisition.
The Frankfurt International Book Messe expects the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will distribute themselves over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403.000 titles. Turkey will be the honourable guest of the event.
The Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will follow a press conference close to the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion figures, trends and perspectives are discussed around the publishing work in Italy.
According to the data, the significance of foreign writers' books in the whole, but especially in adult and youth couples.
The disappeared small aircraft of the billionary Steve Fossett again found
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on a flight over the wilderness of Nevada on 3 September 2007, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the state of California and Nevada.
However, within the plane no human remains were found.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, finally raised the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troop was sent. Now we have the safety that it is the plane with which Steve Fosset fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its closeness.
The 63-year-old billionary was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team had been sent for a few hours after seeing the plane, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fosset was launched in Yerington in Nevada at a three-hour flight.
Finally, yesterday in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal items of Fosset were found by a couple near their house at the Mamoth Lakes.
This is two instructions with the name of Fossets, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fosset had been resigned a month after its disappearance.
The billionary had acquired a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he managed to circulate the world ball in a hot airball in the sixth race: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Under its several records, a 15445 m altitude flight is also covered by the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv, which falls from its original design and the special line management, the exploding surface and its clear angle from the conventional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to inhale new breathing in the sector.
Just because of his extraordinary properties, the idea of Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising room that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a news in the auto sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum burden, which will take the central shopping miles of Mailand, to be carried out by Corso Como until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give a special optic: the new Suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so evidently from the poster on which it is pictured.
This will be illustrated in all its details using the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk in different moments, in order to reconcile it as a whole.
Without doubt, Mercedes' concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of author clam in this more stereotype field.
But will it succeed in raising the interests of future buyers? We will see it.
Now is clear who are the Italian Hooligans
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is now shameful? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has traveled behind the Italian national team for years, and who, honestly, have not caused serious problems until recently.
Never ever happened to conflicts with opposed fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these, other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were found in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the military appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Her models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a confrontation with a truly right-radical fans scene, that of Levski.
By the Figc, the Italian fans had been made available 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the viminal: no one had a running stage ban procedure under those traveling to Sofia.
Four fans of the Italian team, which had already been preloaded in this respect, were also refused to travel to Bulgaria.
Now the viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tiposi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation places, which could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be eliminated immediately, and that such behavior in no case gives the possibility of justification," it says from the viminal.
Therefore, "Augen to especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because there is actually a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisor) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the ashes, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the Hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli, which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italy founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add the 1 of the Osservatorio – crime is committed in the country of their act.
Until now, this group had been held in the sight, but now needs to be considered what has happened and will be done.
But we also talk about the peppers during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, but there is no education...".
