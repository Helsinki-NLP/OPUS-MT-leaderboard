Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just kind.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures of Teheran in the Middle East.
However, at the meeting, the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-country solution should also be addressed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the persistent settlement building of Israel and throws Netanyahu a lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal made by Obama about the Iranic nuclear programme, the relationship of the two has further worsened.
In March, Netanyahu, on the invitation of the Republicans, held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not spoken with Obama, a meeting had rejected this one with reference to the contemporary election in Israel.
In an emergency call Professor says to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "soet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note crushed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no point that Lamb, who was instructed in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school area where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular historian professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the disasterous emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took the life when the police hit him.
One day after shooting at the university, students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to provide a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who were familiar with him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he has no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students visited courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendency to deal with problems.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the lamb, said he seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a conviction for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which the lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him for an automatic way to a job as a assistant professional.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lambs track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the back of a house about a mile south of his parent house at the border of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't clear immediately why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He promovated in the spring in education.
One of the long-year-old friend Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met through common friends.
She and her friends were in the high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game a few years.
He was the woman's swarm then.
All girls melting there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and lived in the Jackson forest of Brandon.
Obviously, Lamb and Prentiss were a few times together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no explanation of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the backstone house that borders to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was okay.
The ex-eheman of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been separated 15 years ago, but friends were left and had a daughter that was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed at the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both on a summer year market three years ago.
Later they played the one or another Gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter's writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after the Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a spermous audience.
There were no signs of anything wrong.
"Simply just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and we screwed together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including dozens, employees, students and members of the municipality, attended a Christmas Light Memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache while the university score "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call printiss called his wife, but there is no point that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set less employees for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to set up 40 000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country. In the Christmas period 2014, 40,000 employees were still set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with an interview and the employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a forward documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it's in my mind that I'm a simulated gan and a arm's length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unfairly the biggest time trip film ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and selected cinema in October.
UN-Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only increase violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chamber again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join together and support integrating negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the front of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regrets that the breakdowns in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation unresolvable.
Ban urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the crisis in Syria, which they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to fire him as a flop.
Others left him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper rounds when examining, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in the two-digit area, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the opportunities of nomination of the real estate-Moguls.
Of course, it is too early in the electoral period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, of which no State won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize tromps' sustainability and start to flow their dollars to crash him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate-Mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trumps popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in the middle of June, an enquiry from the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate-Mogul positive.
Until mid July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP winner GOP would be happy with trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in things enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "inadequate" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the Establishment, the candidate would.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and misleading statements, 52 percent of the Irish electors who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate-Mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-selection state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a supervisor, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent thinks that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters are advancing the idea.
When they set up their scholarship guards, republikan voters believe Trump is real.
If they are asked who earliest wins the GOP nomination, after an investigation by CNN/ORC from last week four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full release: GOP winners had in the past not the most clear crystal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a variety of GOP winners see Trumps campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still hits almost everybody.
Some experts point out that the split field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between tromp and most other Republican candidates, Trump appoints the majority of support.
He has 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hit him?
Ben Carson would pick up the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A little majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says they have educated their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have forgiven their voices firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider, the Neuro surgeon Ben Carson, but choosers who say that they have educated their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "Vollowers" in his election peace two months ago, the immigration was a turn-and-angle point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expressions of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the framelight, it seems to do Donald Trump too.
The frustration of the government climbs to new ceilings.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their external status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday Survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than anyone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republics are frustrated over the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "highly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residents of Germany
This is the most expensive apartment in the Hobooken route - with views over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reet roofhouse costs in the average of EUR 73.300.
"To Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student bid in Munich are not really few.
Unlike Germany's top places, one of the prices occurs like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a rank list of the most exclusive German residential places - with square metres prices in varying heights.
There are several ten thousand euros nix - per square meter, well-noted.
But good, who can do it...
On the other hand, Munich is not at the top here exceptionally.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-fold Torschütze in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy meeting by Thomas Müller opened the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
The Champions League season's sophisticated entrance.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have made a dream start to the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piräus in the "Mission Milan".
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won its play in the Champions League at the Greek record champiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götzes hiter (89.) deserves with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelve launcher success in series is to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich at the third time.
At his 28th meeting in the Champions League, Müller received good support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had a flanked shot of the world champions League.
"We won't underestimate them," had Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis city before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the coins kept word.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea, without glincing.
Piräus had won his recent six home games in the king's class, including against naming clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) stolpered here.
But the Bayern, in seven Europecup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously, but in their offensive efforts, often too uninvented.
The attacks were too often initiated by game shifting to the left outside of Douglas Costa, which rarely came through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more happiness from the right than his flanks from the right half field in the upper left torque.
In the 67th minute the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos storms Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct departure, the Torwart Roberto coupled with the knee (35.).
Though the Bayern used to raise her dominant game, Piräus could put the needle.
On Torhüter Manuel Newer, however, was left.
For example, when he led a shot of Ideye over the late (56.).
A four chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the box, was first sitting outside.
The WM-Held gave green light only after the gradual training, said Sports Chairman Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else of it, that's already bad."
Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by 11 meters, waster put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially damned Bayern fans in their viewer block apparently provoked the adherents of the host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went with slopes against the coins trailers.
At least a Bayern-Fan was injured from the stadium.
Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth
He who smokes does not only harm the lungs, but also the teeth - that makes a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: If not, the risk is rapidly lowered.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is shown in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, in smokers, the risk of premature losing their teeth was to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are cores and inflammations of dental meat, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, emphasising the authors.
Therefore, the relationship between smoking and dental loss is reduced to more frequent dental meat inflammations in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could, however, reduce their risk within a short time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could last over ten years until the danger again sink to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
You must convince people to become non-smokers, student Heiner Boeing of the DIfE explained: "Smoking reduces lifetime."
No smoking is good for lungs and vessels, and according to our knowledge, it also leads to good dental health up to the high age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of dental unemployment were reported by the DIfE.
Earlier investigations had already indicated that smoking increased the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists struggle at Kölner Rheinufer on remnants from the late anchorage
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made at the right Rheinufer in Cologne.
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated scélette and rest of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always attached to as a specialist office for archaeological ground monumental care.
In the third section of the Rhineboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents already known that in the place of the 4th century a festival and in the 8th century a church, Trier explained.
Besides the rest of the fortification and the church orm, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young Woman of Good Train
After a young woman has been disadvantaged at the station in Geilenkirchen-Kinders, the Federal Police asks the population for assistance.
In the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the gleise from the direction of the station buildings at the end of the railroad and was covered by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
It has, according to the Federal Police, suffered the most serious injuries of the train.
She was treated on the site and brought by rescue forces to a hospital.
The reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman is no knowledge to the investigating officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have taken acoustic perceptions.
Inquiry comes residents or passengers from Linderner Railway, Tile Becker Road, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Road (L364).
Indications that provide information on the cause of the accident may be given by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police service at the clock and free hotline of the Federal Police.
The EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
In order to eliminate the dispute on the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current anti-discriminatory system.
The controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between groups and states are therefore intended to be triggered by a more transparent system which is clearly consistent with more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that trusts the citizens," explained Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in the idea.
The Schwedin proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade conversation with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current distortions procedures provide specifically that the EU Member States and the United States jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are intended to come from the same parts of the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time it is also a second instance.
She would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the prosecutors agreed on arbitrary judges, there was no objection against their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
For example, there could be settled disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The Investor State Scied Procedures (ISDS) required by large groups are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional criminal courts are criticised by opposers as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies are able to dissuasive the taxpayers, to lift national laws or to implement a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact indicated the Commission's proposals as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission considers essential points in the reform that the Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private criminal courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Association of BusinessEurope warned that the complaints of the economy should be restricted by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the discussions on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been running since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be set at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer durable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Elf years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Besides him, there is a flipchart on which the shocking peoplesanger recorded the painting U.S. State Michigan with filzstift.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells us on the basis of various places that he always records on the map, which reports his minusious and delicately organized songs.
Where they were created and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative mistake.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" it appears smartly composed songs that are harmoniously close to American people of the late sixty, but at any time in great opulence.
There is a rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be conceived as a result.
But already in 2004 and in Rheinnähe, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
This is what Stevens gets here.
Live satisfies him guitar and Banjo.
One year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a great celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overlapping with ideas and stylistic finance.
The album climbs into the American Billboard Charts and is missing in no annual record of the influenceful music media.
After excessive productive experiments, Stevens uses very extensive electronic transfer pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely organized, but wears programming sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs came out, the stage shows here will be the bunting spectacular of Neon star bands and large fluorescent stage co.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is a part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark Hamburger More!
Theater is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are now bound to sit in their chairs, Stevens will return to intimacy and to the people.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The lecture is "opulenter" and you can thus throw the "Platform in essence".
First to a award, Stevens humblely thanks, plays acousticly few older songs, and eventually rejects himself under a thrilling applause.
Jeremy Corbyns Debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his choice, Mr Corbyns Debuut has been expected to be excited at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister.
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister's questionnaire and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch, which is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Members from the vicinity.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, because it will come to the member of the Shadow Cabinet after its appointment and after his speech at the TUC year's meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to persist on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne at a Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Silence, provoked criticism of a number of tory-MPs and is at the centre of several title-side stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the National Hymn has focused on
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabnett, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program, he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn, "undependence" of his belief that the monarchy should be removed.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC Robin Brant's political correspondent says that political differences are also "stacks" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on gains.
Mr. Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
In hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and retirement minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, who David Cameron, since he is Tory-Chef, has been faced with the dispatch box in Parliament last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30 000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's questionnaire is too confrontative and that he is being abandoned both "sleeveability" and the dispute with retrospects and has made itself focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will be represented if he does not participate, for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also made the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word, and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle theatre" which is often linked with the questionnaire of the Prime Minister. But a few years later he acknowledged that he failed.
Since she was first sent on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the sub-house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed extensive reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Daveless young people trained for photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus deserve life.
"I something shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg ge(er-)shots) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take pictures of their surroundings and achieve a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound grew thoroughly by data that show an increase in the salary growth of the United Kingdom. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result without Boni in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest and made estimates over the date of an increase in interest.
The pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was climbed up to 0.84 % compared to the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition offer of the Rivalen AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries of the world and bring together brands such as Budweisers, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry acts were 0.9% higher after encouraging news by the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales numbers are all expectations and also showed that the turnover in China - a key market for Burberry - is again reporting growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he took $2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the Mondi packaging and paper group were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 0.4% after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company Rating to "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported a pre-skatte result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The Chief of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchase force will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lepish 21 years old, a pendant with upper shick fever.
The guy with the platin blonde hair is 100 million euros hard.
Even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns through.
Like Wikitoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
It includes Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 p.m., however, the police have been sitting on the cold stone plates forming Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdam's place.
The Bieber building: Here you live Idol, whose poster is hanging up in Stettin, since Monday night.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much on the day as her mother Ewa deserves in half a year.
If any.
It says, "My Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class at the gym."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
School obligation?
Who's kidding?
Not the fans.
Even not bee yourself.
He's got out there anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the superbowls, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company spoiled many, many dollars on the bieber account.
And every pump that looks like he and walks over the shop table, casts beeber too.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're disturbing the window slide.
More than 100 million he's supposed to have used this way.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally just in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" at place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida placat brings Libaneses to the potato island idea
Potatoes or dancers?
It is both - and in the Kartoffel Islands, which the Oldenburg Imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the proverb "Cartoffel instead of Daner" on a patch of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat have put together on a spy.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cartoffles instead of Danes", which he had randomly seen in the television.
Since then, in his store, a barbecue spoil has been covered with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
In the meantime, the idea of the Libanese has been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use, according to the Authority’s information.
Therefore, how much meat and how many potatoes of the spies contain, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary national consensus is also good for his customers.
Metcash starts ground-performance campaign for the fight against Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA films from an Aldi opmarsch in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-gross dealer Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in front of a 700 million dollars of Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through Mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as on events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice creator Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA leather and shop owners, sell the taxed tickets for the South Australian footballliga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholesale dealer performs its annual strategy day of investment.
There is a lot in the game, since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provinceal and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analyzers like Morgan Stanley believe that after opening their first markets, Aldi will remove about five percent of the food market in these two countries and remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to one report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million until the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in every market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts of metcash's high fixed cost base, Metcash could cost about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will reduce the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, at a business dinner in Melbourne, told me that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which provide approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt decline at simultaneously pressure on sales and margins.
The large dealer, however, defenders and invests more than 150 million dollars in order to improve sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and deliver IGA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private labels.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop sanitation programmes will be made to Elan and hopes that the large dealer will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kirgios and, in view of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves rather praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger one of the talented duos, called "Special Ks" again and again, led by the famous conflict of Kirgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fire qualifying game in Cincinnati soon afterward, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the violent judge, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to beat Kirgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he crushed a tennis killer after a crampf conquered a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth around the second place in individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup halffinale against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm quite embarrassing about is the fact that, according to my opinion, Thanasi was a little introduced into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a hit when he lost a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player who broke a barbecue of fruit with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the quite provokative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the outdoor area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged after his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he ensures that the man from Canberra is a long-term permanent part of the team."
"First we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not on all the controversials around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has done the rise very quickly, which has pointed to people like Federers and Murray. He rises into the public's eyes, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the framelight, where he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it's best for the crew and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency situation and ceased the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. Everything with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed by the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-country country and responded with respect to Serbian officials.
The people who fled from violence stood fast between the two control points of the countries and built tents and left down there for an unknown time.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter swept over them, the migrants scanned "Opens the border!" and screamed insults against the Hungarian willingness police.
Some showed back food and water from protest.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister stated that it was "inappropriate" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The Turbulencies at the Hungarian-Serbian border were not able to agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-National Block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40 000 people who were seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, finally, next month or until the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120 000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
President Angela Merkel and Austria asked a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes for a soon action of Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to tackle the crisis, so that they could lock roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans the construction of a stable thread to Romania along its border to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a thread on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the Stacheldraht council between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant strike passport and the entry point into the European Union.
President Orban, however, has proved that most arriving economic refugees who are looking for a better life are not war refugees who have the right to protect - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damage to the 4 meters (13 feet) high tongue that the government built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for condemned human dealers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," said the government speaker Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clearly saying that illegal border transition is a crime.
Parliament must continue to agree in procedural terms with the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Advisor for Orban, said that the authorities conquered 45 people in attempting to cross the border, 15 others had already entered deeper into the country.
They come over by harming the shoe, they are now in police conservation and are accused of the infringement of criminal offences in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to fix the sauna quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border transitions with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train guard with a stalk wire had arrived to close the limits.
Chaos surrounded the main border transition near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push in there.
About 20 man managed to come in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important autoway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Choice-2016: Hillary Clinton's spring in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
The former US Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, continues to hold a two-digit front in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-selections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is admitted to the President's office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic electoral elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-selections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is to determine which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some gains.
Clinton holds a great propulsion in women and moderates, but these suggestions have been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen clearly, and Sanders is here only with 5 points.
Clinton's benefit for democratic voters under 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a great lead in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit propulsion in the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point propulsion in this group.
About half of the democratic electoral elections across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic with her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them excitedly.
While 48 percent of the democratic electorates say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republikan voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Aid to deal with the problems and electorality is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President puts a potential for the President's office into the Waage Shell, 57 percent of the democratic electors want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not.
If democratic electors are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids are at the top.
Clinton's followers say more than half that Biden would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If you decide not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's procurement from Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty and fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice, but this number has decreased by 78 percent last month.
Bids are at a distance a second at this measurement, but the percentage that views it as the "selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, democratic voters call questions about choosingability.
Similar to the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electoral electorates is inappropriate.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features in electoral elections of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Bids to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong quality of leadership.
Biden cuts the best from the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe it.
Democratic electoral electors generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued to be asked as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the term of office, most democratic electors of the pre-selections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversies did not affect their general opinions by Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion has still worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the electorates of their party, this remains a problem for them among the electorates who are registered: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are a honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the elected people across the country also consider Trump not honest and untrusted.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes on leadership.
From the six tested candidates, Carson and Bush cut the best with honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks rather honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters at pre-selections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson runs near Donald Trump at a countrywide survey
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others lose a dramatic stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was conducted before the Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is wellcoming in demographic groups and overwhelming Trump among republikan voters with high education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsins governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the most deeply, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
The former Florida Gouverneur Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he lands with 19% support in the Republicans, behind the trump by 32%.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side cover for the former neurochirurg, even after Carson excused himself for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Comfortable bathroom temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean for bathers is already enough to find warm water.
A bath in the North or East Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some don't go to the sea anymore: maximum 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea this week, informs the German weather service (DWD).
Bath temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east it will even reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic area there are at the top of 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a schicanous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the mortality against five persons is submitted.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood arrested Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officers said that he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ruck bag full of sand and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headache, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood did not call on the emergency call number 911 after Deng was deprived and reportedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide outensiles and put the well-being of the brotherhood in principle about what Michael Deng said," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be relived, and he died next morning on his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stunning force injuries to head, rump and upper shear.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the sharks of the brotherhood. At least one student has died to the Schikanes since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be accounted for, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder third degree for the first five members.
Twenty-third members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged for schicanous attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or inappropriate - we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A interest increase comes, and the houses will wander, return for loans will increase, and the economy will run into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history provides only low direction for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in the way the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement may have been overdriven because of an increase in interest.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis is unfortunately interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the "payable money", said Julian Jessop, Chefeconomist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US coins to normal heights, but still to be too low to lead to the seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend based view of how some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen last month, the precaution of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to decline assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Germane-bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after interest increases in the fed.
In the past 35 years, the market is mostly in upward trends - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, rather low in the 250 days afterwards (a mean profit of 2.6 percent), then return to normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chef Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in an increase in interest on the fed.
According to the German Bank, with the 118 interest increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only few expect this to persist and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic couple could be risky and raise the question, "which this time it is different," the German Bank said.
Market participants have set themselves on an increase in interest rates throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, ending on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could authorise an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all elevation cycles from 1950 to today have occurred in a super cycle with increasing fluctuation of GDP, and pre-recession heights have been very rapidly put into the shadow after the start of the recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is at far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months until now.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market leads to an increase in interest, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the return seems to change the direction as soon as the first increase/sensition occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the elevation cycle the loan diets fall immediately, said the German Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse of return between longer and shorter loans and lead to a breakdown of the curve.
High interest rates often bring better profits in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher earnings," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income-Analystin at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the earnings curve is flater, loan volatility has expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
In general, companies that are dealing with the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and become more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse as an increase in dollars will cost their products on the global market and also finance their debts.
"The story shows that "quality-" shares tend to respond very positively three months after a initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analyst in a report to the customers.
Corporations with a strong balance sheet have overcome a low balance sheet of companies after each of the rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 averaged by 5 percentage points.
Businesses with high capital return and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts become a major problem.
Enterprises with a high share of flexible interests will lose most, said Goldman.
Besides pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains by higher earnings, even if experts are different opinions how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter because of its "dumbation"
He argues that he is increasingly not to distinguish from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament's college Damien Collins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he does something that the private sender does not do.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster was "verdamm" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to change Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you are actually just imitating what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director rejected the claims and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'll learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really inevitable.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to order new works, I really think it is important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production which, during the hearing, led to the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports to put the commercial rivals on the feet during the hearing.
The tory Member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £ 22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall claimed that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-weeze".
He added that he wanted the company to find "a hit from our own house" when it started a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend the fees payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet conversions increased the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased by using mobile phones for shopping three years ago
Experts believe that Black Friday has braked the expenditure in November
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping has been treeed, and many of the main shopping streets in Great Britain have turned into spirit cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that online turnovers staggering after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales staggering after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go down until 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to pursue their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is inclined, and we may experience a reduction in growth.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the dismissing transactions.
Experts believe that buyers stop their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November each.
Last year, the average number of purchasers around their computers was five times to make their hands, and some dealers' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for snippets, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 pounds of expenditure was some more than 1 pound online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mekka at cran accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctified
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mekka through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts part of the huge Saudi Bin Charge Group into the breakdown
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured in total after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to buried those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's big mosque.
Sadly filled, mostly in white clothes, the route to count their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Friedhof.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days before a crane of construction crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi King of the Bin Laden family's construction company was a penalty because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beds, which were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mekka, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrim journey when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Moshee.
Saudi officials have already said that the Haddsch to Mekka will continue with thousands of people who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group shouldn't have left the arm of the crane when he was not used.
A Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from traveling abroad.
In the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal, which caused the crash of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the big mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Haddsch, which later takes place in this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the breakdown of de Krans and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also declined the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surrounded Mekka's large mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is directed by the bin-loading group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a deceitful son who was disfellowshipped by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrim travel, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officers said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174.000) should be paid to the members of the killed and the same sum to permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly occupied craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix leather targeted on craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales sites across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British put down their inhibitors and brush in favour of the use of qualified eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can handle with a hammer or brush to strike walls, you seem to be a minority today.
For Britain increasingly employees craftsmen to perform homework in their homes, according to the company's head behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who has the construction market chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at the lowest prices has been overcome.
Consequently, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops that are directed to craftsmen and to close 60 B&Q sales stations.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to occupy more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the men overwhelmed with the employees.
She said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that do more renovation than in the past.
Mrs Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also transformed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in management positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial manager.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher mentioned a decline in half-year profits and sales after the group trained the costs of closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who has Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob due to distrust by court
At the Klagenfurt court, two employees of the Austrian Volleyball-Vizemeister Aich/Dob have had to be responsible for unfaithfulness and deduction on Wednesday.
The accused were not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of official abuse.
It has been legally released in May.
The current process has been broken.
According to Supreme Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the pre-examination investigation had crystallined that the accused persons used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 money from association accounts which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions.
The damage he accounts for is about EUR 400.000.
The sports functioners are also charged for financial infringements.
This fact dismissed the chairman of the Schöfensenats, judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later time.
The defendance of the unfaithfulness declared that the association had not created an asset disadvantage at any time.
The sports functioners had only accounted for burdens and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested much time and money from the debts - the Passives amounted to approximately 600 000 shilling in 2001 (e.g. EUR 44,000).
"Then we were in front of the situation: If we continue or are locking the club?" said one of the accused, in the bread profession of the Finance Office's large business auditor.
With his colleague and fellow complainants, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have shot money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the admission.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, it must only be made no debt.
Furthermore, in the case of financial success, the payment of the burdens was re-acting until 1991.
Therefore, some of the burden damages were paid only years later, from the year 2003 when a plus had been on the account.
Consequently, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accused together, said the second complainant.
The judge asked why the payments were not detailedly disclosed to the association.
The association was not interested in the financial event in detail, it was only important to have been the debt freedom, so the answer.
When in 2011, a amount of EUR 120.000 was transferred to the association account against which a functional investigation was started for abuse of office.
That would have been the reserves, the accused persons explained.
This investment account was run on the name of the second charged person and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know any answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If anything had happened to him, no one knew anything of that money, the lawyer put it in the room.
The complainant had been informed, the functioner justified himself.
This referral was formulated as "shadow reconciliation".
Why damage claim?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first complainant declared that he had not been in agreement with this formula because the association had never been injured.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "with that you are all out of the cutter."
"Is I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functionary said that he never paid a cent, he only calculated mileage money and diets.
In the case of diets, he made account of the association of EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual burden had been much higher, he added.
Exact documentation for the early years could not show the accused ones.
These were no longer stored after an examination of the operation in which everything was considered to be correct, they explained.
The second complainant had also paid money for mileage.
All the remedies were made in bar, so he had to drive from his place of residence the People Market to the Bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue to be consulted by Witnesses on 23 September.
Hewlett-Packard struggles 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the staff degradation for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The postal lines at the US-computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
In its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company customers.
This aims to reduce costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion) on Tuesday, the company informed.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55.000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP was still employing about 302.000 employees.
The Hewlett Packard action was based on 2.3 per cent.
The group grown up with printers from the California Palo Alto is currently split up: This is how the computer and printer business is to be merited in a new society - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be recorded at the stock exchange.
A new disappointing PC set as well as a weaker demand for business customers for their services, the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo, lastly increased.
In the third quarter of business at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This resulted in the redemption in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a breakdown and massive postlines.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded lately that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of buying conventional computers and increasingly performing businesses online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total reduction of about 55.000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission

That other countries fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent find positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian Creator Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29 percent could not decide.

Voice: Violence outbreak at Serbian-Hungary border
The Hungarian police used at the Serbian border at rough tear gas and waterlights against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Back there, a police line was formed, and behind the police was a water vacuum.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials first put in an uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Many tear gases were scattered towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn something awaiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered under breath.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Note Bank
The world observes when the US Note Bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision, whether for the first time for almost a decade the interests are raised or not.
A survey among 80 economists consulted by Reuters found that a little more than half, who was still in the last week of the opinion that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue a little longer and the interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years ago since the Fed interests set on NULL.
"For the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generates only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to increase, but the signs indicate that the opportunities for such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 2 p.m. MEZ on Thursday
Death protector at Delta State University left an excuse letter
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was "injury" at the first murder and wanted to "he could do it inevitable," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, Doctor for Geography and Social Education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the employee of the emergency centre that the police must send police to his home.
He said, "I shouted my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "soet dog" is in the house, but "no one will disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb did not explain his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening, when policers circumcised him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb claimed that printiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "three triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter that is 19 and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
" She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he's not going to prison."
When police gathered him on the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb took his car to the side, fled to the foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his life lau indicates on the University website.
Stars who lost their happiness
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he struggled against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-year partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actress also claims to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was condemned for possession of drugs.
It's probably all that demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the group
The Airhansa plans a large group number.
A half billion euros per year want to save the airhansa group alone with a better organisation.
150 of around 1000 leaders worldwide will cost the group numbering to work.
There are new negotiations with the pilot union.
The airhansa rebuilds its business structure and maintains Eurowings' cheap dogs.
The objective of the re-orientation was a contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and redemption synergies, the airline informed on Wednesday.
Among other things, the airhansa is no longer a board for the passenger business.
The Eurowings Billig Airline was to be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Board of Directors of Chief Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the reconstruction, Spohr emphasizes the importance of Eurowings, with which the groups will join Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organisation of the 120 000 employees of the strong company was complex.
The airlines fixed under the roof of the Airline Passage Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations will be resumed after the legally stopped strike on this Thursday.
That told the trade union.
The subject of the discussions is to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to "in one year with a forecasted record result" to come to sustainable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between union and Airline led to various strikes in the past months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, background is the "Wings" saving concept.
It provides that the Lufthansa is trailing to the concerted Eurowings Billing Line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League downlay of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outer defense to cry and will exclude it from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by an unreasonable attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it has very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the cabin he had an oxygen mask.
It was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red map and the decay of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the violent judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian violent judge had wronged.
You can judge yourself when I say that an eleven meter and a red card were falling.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how deceived I am, my way to heal now begins, I come back stronger."
This was related: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
The Defendant of England has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intent of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno had a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Manship at the WM 2014.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was on a different way, so it looked like he had touched [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Moreno said in conversation with SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I feel very bad with it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a football game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost outdoors.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fable published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps company's website, and continues: "lucky, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read for my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the action of the book, instead renders a content indication of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed, where all nature has gone and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name was Theodor Seus's Geisel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this was not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and starts as follows: "In the enmured city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here a unnamed boy hears the local environment falling by the money-growing trees, Thneed striking one-lear despite the protests of the named Lorax, a hobbling, arrogant being, "which speaks in the name of the trees," is destroyed.
It is highly likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who The Lorax did not read a child 20 times in one another.
A Downing-Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election circuit office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Camerons employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the border that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test seria downlay is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setup, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not bear the names of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth is separated from the England-Test-Kader and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
At his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and this led to nomination, as - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.
Long ago, the course of Lyth had been extended, but he had the control of his own destiny.
If he hopes he will run out further runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not provide such good services, and that doesn't surprise me; he is especially a team man.
The question how much time a test-slave gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton received the chance of playing home and outdoors.
The only condemnation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a struggle I'm highly appreciated.
He is a X factor Cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which met us very much.
It must have at least the same chances as before it, but this, of course, depends on the teaming in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat alongside Cook, what would bring an extra-Spin-Bowler and receive four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a struggle can't beat there, and this left hands have already shown that he's a devil of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited association with him he has impressed me very as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - average 31 with the hitter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Besides the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer stack.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the best guys in the game who will bring a lot of experiences because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the cabin, even if the news is in line with the previously said.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at One-Dayers, Red received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team composers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made in a light heart.
Brexit-Lager (Brexit = Decline of Britain from the EU) could gain access if the economy operates in a flute until 2017.
David Cameron's unextruded new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be deeper in trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is violating for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply collapsed in different crisiss, as the EU is now, and not always in their own fault, the Great Britain’s own agenda with divided constraints and disturbing contractual changes that they do not want to be.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it even if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie-Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes an outlooking Britain inside the EU's tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-looking ministers and officials in some major cities have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautionate cancer Angela Merkel is an alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened to those who are exaggerated for a long time like Thatcher (11 years), Middle edge (14) and Coal (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his reselection or replacement in 2017.
He's also a blessing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will eliminate a leg in order to help the Selfie-Brites whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from getting out of the UK - something they don't want, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
Therefore, some such ministers may intend to plan not even helpful comments, all in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The new negotiation was a plenary" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how robbery the Fleet Street can be at its expense and what EU sceptics are the Oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as they were during the 1975 inspired referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember weakly Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made a name as a "EU-line banana" Brussels-Correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-terrorists, telephone-hackering foreigners and the Pseudo non-Indians, who own most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar to them, but found that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract it instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum controversy, because Blair had set the principle of the unaccepted Constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press never forgot this to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clip on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he no longer needed time to waste me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can last, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I say it once friendly - in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue coloring trends and the wilderly filled of Torys Small Englandism may say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Ben, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and television this week when the path-finder struggled in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell as a shadow-canner was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellows and Members after all reports on their clause session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to provide - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the belt of the social media, a breakfast of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-consciousness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks that way.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multi-decisiveness to the EU membership - in line with their curious captivation economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidentes, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a key principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its multiple precisions to the Nato - Tom Watson, rocksenfest is convinced that JC does not start a campaign for outcoming - foreign diplomas will be obliged to try to find a sense for their supervisors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have mistrust voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government's power, which I was reminded of at the beginning of Monday something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the report by Public Health England on E-Cigarettes
The claims of a Stately funded agency that e cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 persons, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts written in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Grundsatzbericht" last month and describes it as a "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "constructed on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the present best estimate is that e cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to bring their opinion on the damages of different Nicotin products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose managers should have received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared that they would receive funds from an E-Cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that he had to have received in advance from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not delivered, but include several known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate a industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research work "is significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there are no evidence that e cigarettes were early to serve as a means of smoking for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been reacted before.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his addiction.
All evidence indicates that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion on the relative dangers compared to to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually of a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds per year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e cigarettes are not without risk, but only constitute a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former commander of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transmitters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public law programmes, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hardly controversial times against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to make more partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried in his time at Channel 4 without success to contact the BBC for six years.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are ordered or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidiated rivals," said Johnson the Oberhaus Communications Committee in the context of its investigation of the future of the BBC.
If you want to hold the broadcast fee, which I do not think in the mean or long term is a good idea, you should at least make your production on programs that do not make or order others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course crazy.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programmes are financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, to the extent that both own productions are.
Indeed, other channels would give their right arm for this.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for serials that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is debt in the hunting for reviews "for the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular posts of the BBC show what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the more public-law Nish programs should "go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience, but they fulfil their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their sheltered missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcast fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value of this.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a big value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that is true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also proclaimed before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to check their Reitian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it's 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should take an example of "informe, disclose and entertainment" to the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
In the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms of which he said that only one handful is shown in the television, and join alliances with the commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction in the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematods change the direction in the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brainstimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulse into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Flowworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves that then enter into the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves enable the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned, such as a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the micro-blowers and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a path breaking tool that enables scientists to enable and disable neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages toward this technology.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired point in the brain at a optical fiber, low-frequency eltrasound waves of woven tissues may occur unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily attack the targeted human neurons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The advertisements in Britain's arms trade
See Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Frightened murderers!
Fungle crustling legs!
Straw bubbles!
And electric shock sticks that cause annoying pain, but don't leave any trace!
The joyful voice and the cartoon images do not doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a battle parodie produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the willingness of the British government into the slope, to impose weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are seen at bus stops and in the U-Bahn trains and require a second view.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the fonts of the London Underground and the marks of the DLR line, which turns into the picture of a panzer.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are of artists who have issued their work in the Museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collection named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of inbus keys, which is claimed that "acquiring access to approximately one third of the bus stops islands on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this Plakater-"Vandalism" fun.

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100.000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works well with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed on the silence that reigned around the advertising for the arms fair - through a space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "We give them the campaign that they were trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic twisted company advertising, but "through blooming with bright colors and animation, it remains stronger."
"You have made a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen the consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a entry of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment are not being handled illegally before our door door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms knife comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are fantastic euphemist products.

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Elf years ago, as a 19-year-old self-forgotten, I moved to a student's home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those I have angry - and the numerous, long breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be destilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance in student homes is sufficient from easy nervous to absolutely horrible.
It is attractive to sweat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you are "no love or hate honestly Marmite because seriously, boys, it's only a hefeextract HHAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It leads the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn't talk to, even if your whimpers were fired and these fire blobs were.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drink receptions, film night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people are dressing and repressing their underwear.
Related to this: Do not think about starting a relationship to the university
Introverted receive grey treatment at the university.
Her room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room bomb culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of sociality is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Apropos: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes by backing.
Since you start the university at the ceiling of the back-many, it's less strange to imagine with a plate full of Brownies than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I've backed you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
To offer homemade pleasant property is a good way to close friendships.
Their companions feel obliged to talk and may be associating your face with a delicious surprise at the end.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a pleasant baggage.
Badly mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat result in sleeping when you knock.
To steal food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clown of chickens is a thief steel, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say they use themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, this is angry, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my companion who added her milk a dishwasher to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work.
It is not just about being a pleasant man, but that in the true sense of the proverb you belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my walk asked her neighbors if it would make them something less to make Drum & Bass, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They reacted to it with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she had her own music plaired, closed her door and went to her three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly enter the same student home?
In turn, it wouldn't be deeply painful if you were to keep a companion for your future spouse, get to her, get separated and then see them every day and perhaps experience how she moves all the common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot companion definitely is not your future spouse, at least try to discuss your subbounds a little sense.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the limit between an Ulk and Mobbing is more feast than it seems.
A good stroke is funny, but it only takes moments until it gets to the tree.
Give by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never wipe out any room with dental pasta and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not take their possessions on the deck more than twice.
Series for refugees, single-owned, low-valued
The real estate operator Markus Gildner builds series houses for people who don't have much money in the medium-frequent cornerental.
So, for refugees - but also as a signal, "not only refugees need a living room, but also the only mature mother and the smaller one."
"I show how to build in favour of and well today," says the 44-year-old interview
Thousands of refugees will push on the home market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a favourable living room can be created: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push on the home market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or turn halls has no sustainability.
For people are staying here for a large part.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need enough living space in the next decades.
A very banal, three-sized row house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
This is different if you put people in living blocks.
Each of the six houses that are just built in the pilot project consist of three units of residence for four asylum candidates each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overlookable.
Six months of construction took duration.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have carried out my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the settlement regulation.
Cruel.
It is still underlined who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is no place for it.
And refugees and asylum candidates have no cars.
How did the residents respond to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who foretold me to create luxury buildings for asylum candidates.
What definitely is wrong.
But don't you sharp the competition for payable apartments?
Gildner: True is, we have had a construction tree in Germany in the last five years, but we have been built luxury apartments that can hardly afford a more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only mature mother or the smaller one.
I'll show how to build in favour of and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first involved environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have experienced problems after installing, since they receive an error message that announces that the "software update failed" has failed.
To deal with the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the crash goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikelyer by removing the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch off half ways and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Rosberg's only devisor: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight about the WM title in the formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one further devise: "full attack".
The WM area emphasised before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from the title defenders and two-fold champion Hamilton.
The British won seven of the previous twelve seasonal races and also attacks the Flutlight-Grand-Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Britain was able to win the race.
Whether the current Smog in the city state will influence the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by burns on the neighbouring Sumatra island.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The three months ago chess club "Schachfriende Bad Kissingen" has added another member to its series, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the course.
Gauselmann is a member of the Federal Defence Cross. First class and honourable citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation, which the chairman Alfred Klein received.
It is possible to record chess players who cannot make up the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search will also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendship contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" should be seen as an expression of his connection to the Kurstadt.
Queen Office Searches Direct Contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined themselves under the coat of social foundation and opened a new access point at the Graf-Stauffenberg site.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the inner city.
Exactly said to the Graph-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services from the hospital and care providers.
For years, with our ambulant care service, we have found that often plowing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not rare to use many services of the cash, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new houselord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for antenna and civil hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as disturbance prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are perfectly supplemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care", Heike Riedel, director of Saludis, said.
The reason for opening the new quarter office in the city centre is that both managers see the demographic change in particular.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure necessary in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, as emphasizes Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the dedication festivals, the quarter office also devotes itself to the association of the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these are invited to a regular companion."
This makes the social foundation a major contribution that seniors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible.
The quarter office is opened Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m. and Saturday from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m.
Introduction of Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Tracht Bamberg against the third-party Würzburger Kickers had not yet been established, the date was now set on 6 October.
The meeting of the FC entry Bamberg in the eighteen-finale of the Bayeric football Totopokals against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers was now definitively terminated.
Played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19:00 in the Bamberg Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is about the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-licist.
We therefore hope for a number of viewers, and this is not without reason, for flute light games have a special resentment.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC entrepreneur Bamberg in 2010 was defeated by the District Leagues 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the Regional Ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association Pokal 2016/2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With many, the artist's house loses a honourable member and at the same time "a of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as stated in the broadcast.
In 1922 in Vienna, many studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a free - creation architect, but he was also a teacher, writer and institute leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formulation.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the establishment of the treasure chamber in Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian theatre museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese casts police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed awesomely in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-national tourist in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is engaged in wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added, according to his own statement, during the last two years.
He did not have any intellectual effect on the other hand.
Whee was just cutting the hair in the Bremer Innenstadt when he saw a parking room guardian outlay a penalty for his white chevrolet Camaro.
Wise then crashed from the business, insulted the officer and cast her the penalty before the feet, as the "Image" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the claims, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only afterwards, it will decide whether the show is shown, or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suitable for the cultivation of the marijuana plants.
For three days the Panama authorities have cut out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men climb to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17 - year - old Afghane, was following his two friends in a distance of about five meters, and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
In the area of the tank station, three people also stayed.
One of these men now screamed to the youths and hit it with the faist in the face.
The victim suffered a nose break and bleeded strongly out of the nose.
When his two friends grew up and speaked in vainly on the battle, he first left from his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The acter pursued the group with a car to its apartment and went there several times demonstratively.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the fighter and another male person.
With the aid of a strike, the victim’s face and upper sheep were pressed.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
Until now there is only a vage description.
One of the men was about 1,80 feet tall.
The second stroke should have been about 1,65 metres large and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and advisors to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes practitioner Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also a joy of Congregation champion Bernd Bormann, economic supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country lacking doctors - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next months.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the rooms at the St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at the first sight when the Felstehausens, Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently graduates her medical training in the Defense Hospital and wants to get into practice in the next year.
"We always had in the back of the head that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laugh.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea to operate its own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As a advantage, he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the wasters bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical study in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a supervisor in Sulingen, and he was also ordered to be the leader in 2009, in the circle of Diepholz, and is engaged in the DRK Brochhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September the practice is prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to leave themselves as a home doctor.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After rebuilding, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound checks as well as long-term and load EKGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total grant of EUR 50000 will be granted to the wastes in the framework of a support programme from the district (25000 euro) as well as from the community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and joyful we are that practice is being continued," emphasizes Samtgemeinde Bürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
Approximately 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, each quarter come into practice Felstehausen, in the north German average practice it is about 500.
There is another practitioner in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice overtake by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found her, she would have gone.
Anyone who visits Müller's speaking hours, also continues to look especially in familiar faces: take over the seven medical staff and the cleaning force of the rock houses.
With their departure in Asendorf, the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"We had only two rooms at the beginning," Ursel Felstehausen recalls fascinating.
A little mourning she feels after a long time.
"But we live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients more often," says the internist.
Her husband supplements laughing, "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"Bisher I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could become different."
In addition, the pair has two grandsons and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We leave the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also be raised at our southern border," said Innenminister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this.
Still, it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application could make this "self-understanding".
People's supply and security are in the foreground.
Of course, however, "that there is a need for clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even not over the Austrian-Slowenic border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considered "Korridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously notified, and Slovenia also wanted to leave incoming refugees toward Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for refugees.
However, this is not the case with the Inner Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially for Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to cut its limits on refugees.
"Every EU member must fill his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia on the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid during the night hours on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could attack them in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media since then, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly engaged.
It is mainly Syrian and Afghan, including many women and children.
Salvation services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was counted with about 4000 refugees, said Inner Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which have brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would pass towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in Wednesday.
The Government in Belgrade, however, doubted that it was to instruct people to set certain routes: "We can neither, nor do we want to do so," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border city Sid was arrived in the morning, and further buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inhabitants had traveled through Serbia the entire night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has made it, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In fact, this could actually come to a slightly further western route to the shift that has already been foretold by observers in the past Balkan Route of Turkey-Greeceland-Mazedonia-Serbien-Ungarn.
Croatia: "First options for border control"
Croatia's Inner Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
It did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as non-Schengen member has "all the possibilities of border control".
Strong controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007, and the EU partners have been making a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to be found behind the Hungarian border sauna.
According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully locked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to rest on Wednesday at a local eye certificate in Horgos: he believes that the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is closed, are early.
It would not be very high refugee numbers at present.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute to the refugee maps on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
The cross-border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is, however, not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still uncleaned minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine spacers was sent to the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranok is supposed to have heard of a ring of cybercrimines, which has been suggested to have ever again insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information provided is intended to have been made on the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators reported that more than $100 million were rented.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused persons took place in the case.
Most of the accused ones come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The actors should have acted out both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Economy Hospital Assistance Mannheim has been present for 20 years
Round the Mannheimer Paradeplatz is a dominant operation.
People do their concerns, partly fast steps, partly cozyly fumbling.
They control the two stations of Mannheimer Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Hold city trails.
Pulsating, glorious life at the glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tables each with the title "Before I want to die."...
The Economy Hospital Assistance took this action into account its 20-year-old existence and looks to be faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, that's why we've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The head of the Economy Hospital Assistance is also available to the passengers for questions and conversations as well as to the honorable employees.
While some a Passover suddenly touches the cream and the sentence of "yielding my life", "reading", "runing through the United States," "stop war" or "not long suffering", others remain short, read, say phrases like "I am not so far yet" and then continue.
Every time again, small discussions on the action develop on themselves, on life, on dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that at some point the end of this world comes to me, I can live responsible," says the director of the Diaconical Work of Mannheim, who is a member of the Caritas Association of Economy Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this public-effective action to the 20-year-old is good.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, but be understandable, eventually, it is a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death is still arrested with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lammer, although the physician movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and grief companion belongs to the honorable employees of the first hour.
Through personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death aid.
When the Economy Hospital Assistance searched for honor officials by call, it immediately reported and had been with the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honorable officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied the affected and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospital Sankt Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle their task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another waiter, think it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free of charge and independence.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of families and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and grief companion.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now issued in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal wishes can also be recorded on postal cards there.
FedEx mixed result, financial views reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit prospect to a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55.000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set 50.000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous prediction.
Analytics expected, according to a survey of FactSet $10.84.
Despite the price increases that are averaged 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher land transport allowances from heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that, however, it expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in the online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is providing solid profits if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the UPS Rivale, which plans to set up 90.000 to 95.000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which asked 12 of Zacks Investment Research foreseen analysts.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks asked analyzers expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has a decrease in the international priority shipment, which brought the turnover in its unit of Express-Sending to the stamp.
But the tree in the online hopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operational result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-surance.
The Express Unit reported higher income due to higher prices, while the result was due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record hook on 11 June.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spends Strategen two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the rate for the first time for almost a decade.
Through them at the end of the sealed two-stage hall, a wall image of the United States is located.
The map is a reminder of the fact that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and their colleagues have to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold order from the Congress: keeping the maximization of US employment and prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. It will be known on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start from the exampleless incentive from the nearly zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it grows solidly, the recent turbulencies on the global financial markets could make the already careful Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by increasing the interest of federal loans - and it is only a quarter of the percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they see," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefeconomist at the Makler Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an incentive not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself unsures the financial market.
About half of the economists, who have recently been consulted by Bloomberg, have predicted an increase in interest this week.
The financial markets, however, expect a departure of the Fed, with a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% chance of increasing.
This indicates a decline in the share market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the Strategates decline the struggle by promised that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 228.89 points or 1.4% at 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefomon at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be surprising if the Fed raised the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "they would have to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they could not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm down the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the fed seemed good to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slowly sharpening the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals, that more economic progress would be needed, it would expect an increase in the sentence.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the Fed views as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need it because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefonomics at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed by the end of last month after China had assessed its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% under its maximum level in May when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered something this month, whereas the Dow is now nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulents influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracted at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Note Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better handled.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication by the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "unify" its monetary expansion, triggered confusions around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly merged, the Fed representatives can expect that they are not only monitoring developments in other places, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to obtain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the property management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is engaged in an increase in interest, quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its rates by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "truths of limited awareness on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives reversed these reductions.
The Fed should put into the first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee on the Settlement of Interest of the Bank of England.
The recent turbulencies do not come near this level, he said.
"Surely, she does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest, because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should accomplish the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a large- Thai market which is also sold to the general public.
Yes, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/store is a central access point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dish, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to slide through the gangs.
If all shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garbage (good and price) in this store is located near the boxes and has various removal options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are valuable and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat deck is extensive, as well as the fish deck - the staff behind the theke will clean and filtrate the fish and even on wish for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melone and galgant, whole entrances, fish, bovine blood and gallery, pig-nature tarms, fishballs, regional worst, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide tunnels are suitable for shopping cars and gloves.

Where it is located: The shop is located in a industrial area of Los Angeles at the edge of Chinatown and the Inner City - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, you will not go without the commitment of countless honorable helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unequivocal asylum candidates in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she's doing it in the asylum applicant's home at the Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a right school.
Brazil’s Children’s Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to shock women about how important good diet is during breast-feeding time. It is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies that suction on breasts painted with presentations of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and hydrocarbons that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnancy and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calories supply is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sportshalle
The Municipal Council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar system.
The plans for the long desired tour hall construction at the Bernrieder Sports Territorium are stepped forward: In the recent municipal council meeting, the draft construction application was unanimously seen without major discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, inter alia, another application for a construction "exception" and "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the authorization for a special form of roof design.
It is therefore intended to create a "Satelteltach with non-mediate first and roof overstep".
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderful large south roof," explained Mayor Joseph Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "release" was, again, the deck-need, which is to be less than ten degrees for energy reasons - different from in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "release" was therefore necessary because the construction plan concerning the ceiling does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernrieder municipality Council usually is more restrictive in the case of free movement applications.
However, it is not a recurrent project in the tour hall construction: "We do not create a predecession for this," says Steigenberger.
The tour hall construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are charged.
Subsidies are expected by school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now presented to the Landratsamt for testing.
Klinik Pittenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Pittenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Songau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Pittenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which confirmed the landlord Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will be taken on Wednesday, September 23th.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pittenberg would continue to work.
Most of the majority should be moved to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining interior station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who can't go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner-White.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the doctor’s director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
In the question of who is going to join the success, according to Jochner White, the name "Fisher" came into the game, who declared ready to take the lead from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this meant in any case a "upgrade" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Your Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the inner station on gastroenterological diseases.
In transition for the next two years, fishermen with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses, until then next year, the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which has more than 35 beds, will be closed in Pittenberg after nearly 140 years.
Until now, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the hospital Weilheim was completed.
Landratin Jochner-White, also chairman of the Board of Supervisors, hit rumors from which the house in possession of the Federal Federation is to be used as accommodation for asylum webers in the future.
"That I exclude." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-White could not say there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatrie.
"What better couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi transfer to the Lech, which had been "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house in which the fisherman has worked as a chief for over 30 years has not been there.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the medical director.
In the past decades, the Pittenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) was constantly threatened by closing, departments were closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhine Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the mountainic HC.
The leader of the Federal Liga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superiority.
During the last season, the BHC bathers had a painful defeat and had something to do with them.
Yacht dunfall with two injured people at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been severely injured by shots during their maizes on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Aberntent on a maize field at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police informed.
After a shooting, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals.
As it could come to the accident, it was first unclear.
Criminal police detected.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Pfalz victims of violence crime
A suspicious has led the police to the body of 16 missing from Rhineland-Pfalz since Saturday.
In the hearing, the 20-year-old admitted the youths killed and cast their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Pfalz has been victim of a crime of violence since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen at Emperor Slauts on Tuesday evening, such as state lawyer and police announced on Wednesday.
As a suspicion, a 20-year-old arrested 20-year-old, who was according to the statement and led the investigators to the founding place of the body.
The 16-year-old had been missed on Sunday morning after she had not come home in the past evening after a visit to a herbst festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
When looking for the young woman, the investigators first found personal objects of the victim.
Finally, in the interviews in the friendship and familiarity of the missing ones, there was a suspicion against the 20-year-olds.
The disgusting actor then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrester, the authorities admitted to the police hearing, killed the 16-year-olds and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the investigators put him to the burden of death.
The further investigations are to be carried out on the closer circumstances of the fact.
Refugees need accommodations: Study warns against dwelling
The location on the German housing market is excited.
More and more refugees also seek a payable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German home market have long started.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing on a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with income weak citizens for the last payable apartments.
To cover the demand for payable apartments, 400.000 new units must be built by 2020 each year.
This result comes to a study in order of the Association "Social housing building".
To compare: This year in Germany, 260.000 units will be completed.
There are 100.000 apartments missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their stay than asylum seekers.
Many then enter the apartment market and run into the long serpents before the rental apartments.
However, according to the Statistical Federal Office, less than half of all asylum candidates lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only at the increase in refugee rates.
The study also produces significant failures in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany appears to be a home deficit that will increase from year to year.
At present, some 770.000 residential units were already missing in the ballast areas, complained Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaut on the apartment market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per head has been decreased again in the past years.
In order to solve the problem, the Association proposes a restart of "Social housing building".
New incentives are intended to reinforce social housing.
Thus, the basic acquisition tax could be avoided and the basic tax on funded apartments could be suspended on a deadline.
In addition, according to the Association, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation by the National Bank KfW is already well at cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros had already been collected on Monday evening more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
According to Hungary, there is virtually no longer a passion, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without barriers.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said the Croatian interior minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
Hundreds of refugees have been broke up to Croatia after the Serbian-Hungary border has been declined to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had set its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, make the appropriate asylum procedures in Hungary practically excessive.
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can travel through and we prepare for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU-Nachbarland Croatia.
Most media reports reported from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border city Sid with both the bus and taxes.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-serbian border, however, the refugees do not run on borders.
For that reason, the border strips present other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine spacers are now aimed to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after Hungary, no more refugees come after the border has closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
It had been 9380 shortly before the tower was closed on Monday.
The new Hungarian laws confused the overcoming and harmfulness of the border season as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The sentenced threaten prisons up to five years and the departure from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the new border, almost all - 93 - the most important transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
However, practically nobody has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants are to be disposed of there.
A few hundred refugees were gathered before the "transit zone" in Roszke.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up it.
They collected the waste that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the border of the streets.
Locker grids were removed and one of the recording warehouses in the border was converted.
For the purpose of this conversion, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria reaches only few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, about 20 000 migrants remained in the country according to government claims.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the direction of German authorities.
In Freilasing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met to foot.
Citizen's champion passed across the border.
"We were busy with cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people were standing with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein's Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau with the train.
Because Germany was surprisingly putting the railways with Austria on Sunday, for them was ended in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beached with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
In the past, we have first delighted the unforgettable guests with jause and drinks.
We just said we'd bring them to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN speech.
They were very grateful.
A man was not able to take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire war.
"We have been very happy," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the beached train passengers had gone from a ICE to a regional journey towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short-term pronunciation that the rail transport was suspended to Germany.
However, the regional train was taken before the border in Wernstein at Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival is associated with the Bayerian neighbors on Sunday, day before a branch bridge course sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends to us thousands of more, is a logical result of a sheltered policy:
Instead of helping in the camp of Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has pushed the Hungarian government in the dark circle of national socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to find that the "faithful land" which they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge to create human protection conditions with regard to the persistent refugee flows and the near winter.
And it will be even bigger to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter festivals
Konrad has to do with the refugee submission all hands full.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
Also, the transportation of the 20 000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had been done without a big weather, Konrad said and praised the organizational "meester performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisisful situation".
Totally, Konrad calculates a requirement of 85,000 quarters in the current year.
In order to meet the number, we need to find 35.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20 000 will provide the countries, 15 000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's no fashion without soil," said Konrad.
He has already talked with the heads of the country.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's good," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to be explained how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer incomplicated accommodations.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high" yesterday.
In emergency times, it may not be that quartier donors must have a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a time-limit, "Notstandards" must be applied.
The fact that he is more successful, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, constructs Konrad with his experience.
I am an older lord who is not to say the intrusion in the face without anything.
Conviction power is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause costs as they themselves explained.
Their employees want to increase them to three to four.
Your own vacation search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephans place as a office.
However, there seems to be problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better breakdown
First, no opening urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for refugees are planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it can be done without these measures at present, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations are to be checked on their thoroughness.
Critically, the chief of the city exercises the division of refugees within the state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Grenzes are not cut off"
In a longer telephone with the Bayrian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), national head Joseph Pühringer (VP) accorded on Monday the further approach in the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not covered.
Refugees continue to travel to the Federal Republic.
However, there are now just border controls.
Special traits with refugees to Germany will not be anymore.
However, the protective applicants were brought to Germany by regular moves.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue once more.
The fact that Austria is re-introducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the course of the Germans.
Next Runtastic is a question of time
Generalisation of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production Building, the exchangered IT group S&T, the rest of the 2 700 square meters is to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we need to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Werft and later also which to acquire.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises some of: "The next runtastic is only a question of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of the Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is paved by Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for further 40 percent it gives questions.
Lia-Peroni holder opened second business in the Arcade
In the new shop Furla handbags are central.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to make a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the due market arcade in a short time: finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop versus the business in which it sells, among other things bags, bags, shoes and walls of different manufacturers, everything now turns to women's handbags of the brand Furla, money exchanges are to have from EUR 75.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to EUR 500.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
There were several weeks before being converted.
"I have been thinking for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
The decision was essential, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of a location where only their pockets are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large room of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots.
Her fashion-interest has been put widely from her mother into the weighing.
I am most thrilled when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why, when some woman looks at a beautiful pocket in decoration, the specialist woman can not answer with last security.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag is evaluating every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This property also connects some to the billionary who wants to become president of the US.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciting.
Whether he expresses himself in a foreign state, is talking about journalists red, or it reveals gaps of knowledge in international crisis policy - the applicants for the US presidential office are strongly interrupting the electoral struggle.
And cut off with it.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate millionaire come.
The New Yorker with feet freeze is a concept of many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants are over twenty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral mode.
Simone Wendel, the cold townster, turned a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the mightyst man of the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but are not so impressed in their cold city species," says Simone Wendel.
The borne cold townster has turned a funny documentary film about the place and its famous sprays, including the Ketchup family Heinz, besides Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so as to say that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of the heart.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to believe that Trump is "show a bit a big mouth," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that the Cold City has in the circuit, "The Brulljesmaker" - to Hochdeutsch: the Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the Angeber.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of grandparents was not free of tragic: their desire to return to the home permanently failed to the Bavarian State, which the Pfalz then belonged to.
He didn't take Trump because he was once left without approval, the director of the Institute of Palestinian History and Public Health, Roland Paul, had explained to the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of a "unfailed immigrant".
This is contrasted with the sometimes marking statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to shock illegal immigrants.
"As poltered, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative trumps ("The grandma was a born trump, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The winner in retirement looks more distant to the American, "he's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
The pensionist Veronika Schramm mentioned as some cold towns that a descendant of Heinz's family gave something for the church narrow at a visit, which was generally well arrived.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It's better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the story in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather would have been like he, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President isn't," she says.
And, "The grapes will be mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12 000 cinema gangers, even in the United States, gained interest.
The Upperbayer municipality Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitants-Dorf at the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for mild tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteigerdores".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpen Association is responsible for the award of the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are going to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but there have not been any major shifts in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was released by the Federal Capital City when Malcolm Turnbull created the crash by Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the Moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was a part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to play any role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise achieved average 397.000 viewers in the five main cities, compared to Today 339.000.
Today, a slight increase compared to the rates for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached average 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40.000 and 50.000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349.000 viewers to 314.000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning men more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently known father, who decides to leave with his two children at the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the Rafter Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and shot the Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, showed an average of 446.000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623.000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 5200,000 viewers, and in the second half hour 7200,000.
Hot seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will convince Nine to vote that the hot site will eventually survive at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that did not make it possible to override the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have uncertainly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor, was sheltered in the greatest secret.
And none of the three left girls will certainly not be awarded if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day, before from three becomes two, you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the victory.
Sam Wood holds his lips fast sealed until the end of the Thursday
All three women have been lyrics about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as a reason for their desire to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could be to the degradator who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it's so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit made her clear last week that Wood could be "the One".
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this seems not just to be a game - I am now uncontainable to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls likewise - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is exposed to Ten on Wednesday, 19:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL carriage.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after he moved to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a grill as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga convertit at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a point return and also in the running game after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the cabin after the game.
Instead of melting his smokes before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his past catch and care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first play area by the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly was not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playground after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL carriage,
"That was a thing that happens now, you're just taking care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the cutter with his original Debuut in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
It was still a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of sulphurs
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Sibirian rolling field with weapons violence.
After experiencing President Vladimir Putin openly, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company captured Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bayern because of the high refugee numbers.
At the beginning of the FW Herbst Clause in Grootwallstadt, Chairman of the Party and Group, Hubert Aiwanger warned against a serious crisis in Bayern's schools when there are no new teachers in accordance with the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from the collaps," said Aiwanger.
"Once we will receive rejections in the Bayer's education system."
The country-day fraction of the free voters takes up to Friday in the underfranky municipality.
Actually, there were other main themes.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free electoral troops.
"Of course, the asylum will overlay the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the nineties.
"This is not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Chairman.
Rejected asylum candidates want to dispose of the free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal countries are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the Federal States across the world."
"Bayers are kicking off, others don't."
"Then we have to be more handlingable."
But the country's policy in Grandwall City should not fall under the table.
A yearly permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister for Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasia started the pilot attempt "Medium Grade plus", which tested an extension of the gymnasial centre from three to four years - then it will take back nine years to the abitur.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The topic G9 must be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all the high schools who want to do so.
Free ride at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after cops shoot on demonstrations in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police had shot rubber shoots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in the Rupandehi district on Tuesday night, about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside of a police station, while some of you were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she went back on rubber fires.
20 policemen and five civilians were hurt, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber fires, known that they could kill, but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The conflict was the last violent protests in Nepal's southern levels in weeks, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces, which are formed under the proposed new Constitution, would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since 10.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the lawyers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The lawyers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planned building area in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metres.
Planned is a mixture of trade, industry and living - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Youth Centre of Old Post.
The preparations for this are currently ongoing.
It is planned to use the area for a mix of trade, industry and living.
You're waiting for the corresponding offers, it's from the city.
The investor in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the property that is on the Ringstraße / Ecke Large Street already a few months ago and had to remove the buildings therein.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday homeing at the small sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some applicants are further concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational refugee
For months after closed doors had been negotiated, engraved, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the small sea are close to Emden on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder Company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Committee on the Development of the City of the Council.
This point had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP fraction, which prevocated the investor and the management of secrets, Ralf Behrends went from the system-buu business management to the open, "We have not yet a answer to all questions," he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to meet all the rumors now.
The project has been discussed for about ten to twelve million euros for months.
Heavy reactions among sea bay owners, who had come to the meeting, called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea bay owner and board member in the representative of the applicants, Pro Hieve, complains: "There is a giant cloth that is overridden of all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like some other project critics, that traffic would grow strongly through the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus charges to calculate it," says Schulz
What happens exactly on the well a hectare large area of the former guest place, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we must have a clear concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Zwillings-Nachwachs bei Gorillas, Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is pleased with his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought two to the world yesterday.
Twinish births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, since Mother Dian holds her close to the body until now.
First, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center foretold a wide deep printing system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southest Cape Verde islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical weather in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined depth pressure system, such as in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical weatherstorm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign to bring up $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they escape from war crushed and armed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach in the announcement of the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"In our journey, many dark rail and bus journeys, also hunger, thirst, cold and fear, was included," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com/refugee survival to $11 million.
Europe has been faced with its worst refuge crisis since the Second World War, mostly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people this year.
Many refugees also from the Afghanistan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya disrupted by war.

For mildly overweight diabetes patients, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight humans with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-urgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote a lead article about the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to take food.
Over the years, Adipositas operations have proved to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are illly fattening with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be fat.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of Adipositas Chirurgie - Magenbypass and Magen Schlauchbildung - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweighted.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained in those who received non-urgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgical intervention, the diabetes disease was completely and partially dissolved by 36% and 28%.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison with diabetes, only dissolved at one percent and partly at about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglyceride and the "slecht" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'chirurgic' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glucose control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce death in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Chirurgie group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrektomia group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in BMI (7.4 v. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and reported a complete surplus of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show survival benefits after five years, there are evidence from a study of severer people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone says from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was approximately 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group who tried conventional methods.
Though the new study did not show any advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was calm for people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have their body firmly linked with fatigue and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a theme that is currently increasing in Belletristic: a young woman, in school times unloved and indispensable, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and it loves her.
Likewise in the recent Roman "We are not really like" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the history of love, the Roman is likely to be interesting, especially for Hunsrücker readers, because he plays in Langweilers and the surrounding villages.
The chief professional author has grown up in a long way and is happy that she could set a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not absorb all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admired, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria praised efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Take care of several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how a true peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and showed that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violation.
"I know his motives were good, but he put violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increases in intake of hand infection agents by children over the past 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report a almost 400% increase in the number of children under 12 years of age, which swallow strong alcoholic man-infectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intakes of handdes infections in children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 6.117 in 2014.
"Kids come to these products increasingly, and unfortunately a percentage of them goes into the emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants, while some are doing it to impress their friends or for a trial of mutation in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths claimed to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water in order to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with earthberries, grape grape and orange fragrance that are very attractive to children.
Hand infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in young children, few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Notruf Center at the University of Kansas, the Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let swallow Whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in a range of children, and when children come into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections from the odouring hand infection agent after earth bear in school, was taken into emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally valid for a adult than drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency recording doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency recording.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate kid hospital on signs of brain dreams, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and shot her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very anxious," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand infection agents outside the range of the child.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the swallowing of hand infections containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Staff of health authorities suspects that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their "general" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the teaching room," it reports a police report.
The teacher is high-grade allergic to hand detergents and banned her from her room.
The police viewed the deceased plan as "saving" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villings-Swinging: Three vehicles corrupted
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in the event of an incidence on the crossspange between the Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old carriage driver traveled on the crossspange towards circuit industry area and noticed too late that the circuit traffic had stopped two pre-run vehicles.
As a result, he plucked with his truck into the hack of an Audis and pushed this vehicle on a ford Fiesta.
In the case of accident-related vehicles, the police are informed of the damages of approximately 10 000 euros.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be dropped.
No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays the speech of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA because of Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be careful in January's new commitments that could destroy the unit of the Cader
Increase Dons Guide over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Eleven meters in the first half of the season gave Aberdeen a button victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gate between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony down
There are rumours about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This claimed that he and his teammates are not under higher control, since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football is boring Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers Mediterranean player and former national player in the Netherlands Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title role with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they no longer show peaks of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swear.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent excursion from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10 men from Aberdeen, which are now clearly on the top of the table with five points of front.
But Deila said, "Celtic had a bad time before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel it just like that - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
It is so important to stand together now.
Warburton carefully on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, indicating that he had a few January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and persists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox-caders.
The ex-Chief of Brentford said, "The January-Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this presaison time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is made by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea Storm Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract runs out of the Swans.
For two years, the 29-year-old has suffered a disgraceful knee and has not managed the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts set on SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the red map of the defense was later lifted - the third red map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said, and persists: "I haven't questioned integrity, I haven't commented on any performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The inexperienced Hibee was corrected after he granted a song with incredible texts about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a Kneipe in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the storm and added, "It's sure to say I'm not returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly persists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to rotate the things - but conceives that the decline has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the boys back on trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes' joy to win against Hamilton "unpleasant".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive League victory that brought them a spring of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in pokal games or leagues that have not even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it increases in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164 000 in the period May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10.000 in the same period to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above 5.5% in the UK, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2 612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The state secretary of Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said, "The long-term plan of the government has put the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
Drinks disturbed the course
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to maintain the disturbances.
Atemalcohol test was performed at a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The growing one was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and was first maintained.
Why I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a watcher gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is exercised by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day went closer, I began to fear myself.
So, why should I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and there are often more applications available than places, a makaker lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will observe it emotionally.
I can't.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend with which I have developed my own relationship with telephones and a two and a half hour visit during the months.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a Witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to give up my inpartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she could have "it was better formed," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would do it.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all details here.
I can't certainly say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiaries of the act.
But I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there are not enough evidence to justify a death judgment.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death.
Man persecuted for moist police persecution to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to hang off the police was unfortunate when he was in the sealed and stunning water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "overreach him softly to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police was called on Tuesday for a house-friedensbreak event in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform nass, so he applied a more reliable tactics - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unable, but inspired residents to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spion him out and threatens to stop racing sports
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his places last year and threatened to stop race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a Rennday Treatment, the last Strohhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing sports and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt topper sample in Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had retired 18 months because of spionage claims and he didn't want it "looking too high-hanging grapes."
"I had to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting long after it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to deal with raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do this, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spion his stal.
"At eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I would name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my places to provide information about what I do within my place," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe I'm a betrayer.
If this is the case, they should certainly take on their noses because they failed in trying to get me.
Robert Roulston, ehem. Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, official president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of it at the time and is still aware of it.
Should this make me feel that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behavior and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Is I bad for the industry?
Is I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take me my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say let them think about it now.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will exercise the pressure on them and I will urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer has built up with the long-standing cobalt examination at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to saying that he could "she could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unattached Master Black Caviar, described the Renntags Treatment Rule "intelligent", after a pack of mud or sound had been placed on the horse legs, which disturbed the rules.
"It's against the rules of race sport.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly carried slam on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the packaging on the race day. An examination of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after a driver flight
The police arrested a man after a hit with a bike driver and then a driver flight in Cobram in the weekend.
The wheelchair was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia from Shepparton was in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for a rider flight and abandonment and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals for claims on ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized his players as "Agenda setting" by two Prime League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster Trainer Trent Robinson said that the guards allowed the Storm players "ring fighting" with his team during the high storm victory at the Qualifying Finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Musterexample" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "for good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the thanksgiving of his team and said they were focused only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team would be confident to him, as it meant that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team.
"I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything on our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with thankles a real focus, and that has resulted in the trend change for us.
Trent has now been there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. Therefore he is probably not used to lose, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny how this happens again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "slow" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'll take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we view as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks making and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team has been free this weekend, since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the prefinale of the AAMI Park. The ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200.000 deposit by drug charge
A man who may threaten a lifelong punishment because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and built in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his co-advocates in the hunting port during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong penalty for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been for an innocent reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of refuge at Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
He was lying to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfathers had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security together to reach its release.
"After reading the necessity statements of the two persons, it is clear that the settlement of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against security, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and his Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and keeps on a starting block of 18:00-06:00.

Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to attract pedophile to send pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when this slept, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a number of inappropriate pictures of children sent by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it, as it would lead to "Pedophile in the Internet" and then he "declared to be a policeman to scare them."
The state lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court, "he said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He confessed that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said that it had happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and he asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock them down.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was crying and crying.
She then also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the charged computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the accusation to have taken inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have infringed the orders on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before court on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his mistake.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the judgment until October in order to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted security in this case, but for consultations with other outstanding cases, he was kept in investigation.
He was added to the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Schleuser weighed out on small crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are attacked by the large control points at the German-Eastern Kingdom border.
Many sludges made fear of discovery and arrest people growing at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, said a speaker of the Federal Police.
During the border flow of Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been attacked in the districts Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking over bridges and dusts to the German side.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
At Munchner’s main railway station, according to Bundespolizei-Angaben, compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, more refugees returned significantly.
At 8:00 a.m., some 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After re-introduction of controls at the German-Österreich border, refugees reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Expected runners of Tropenstorm "Henry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German weather service (DWD) in Stuttgart communicated.
The strong depth is the depth of the Tropenstorm "Henry", which in the past days had moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and twists are expected mainly in baths.
According to DWD, to Thursday morning, the black forest, the swabic alb and the soil circuit are counted with blows from 60 to 90 hours.
Thus, on Friday, the sun can be looked again.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
In 2015, there is especially movement in the compact cars that are currently selling very well.
Cars from the compact class are currently specially asked: around 28.1 percent of the new permits, according to the KBA, alone in August, came to this segment.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publicum Day 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futurist concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, who will be with the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann on the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra is not to be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers a rise below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at EUR 17 650.
The current Astra costs from EUR 16 990.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three cylinder benzenes for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five doors.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what will be done next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
On the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a fifth door in a conventional and stressed sporting GT version.
In the trade he comes in the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan Delegate wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its swinged lines fits completely into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer data.
The sales start of Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën delegator were especially handed on the front part: Here the cooler grill was resigned and the changed lamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time integrated Apples CarPlay.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a series of reviews and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are human invaluable
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to a ex-haupt of the Court of Justice Tegel, which has been placed in a small cell for months.
Because of the injury of their human dignity, prisoners are principally entitled to financial compensation when they are put into small cells.
This has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even then, they can hope for money if they were only a few days locked in the rooms too close (Act.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This was the success of an ex-catch with his constitutional concern in Karlsruhe: he was placed in the Berlin-Tegel Junction Institute between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of ground surface; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who was relocated, according to his lawyer’s statement, was moved to a larger cell.
However, his office complaint for the unworthy prison conditions against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
Chamber court now decides above the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons, only a few days of remuneration in prison for the period concerned, there was a claim on compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "a contempt of the legal protection of personality".
The Court of First Instance has now to clear the amount of money damage.
In the past, the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
Thus they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell.
Human invaluation is also due to a 2011 decision to the multiple use of a cell without separate toilets.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday, the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which in a parallel event in November 2009 had confirmed an incredible establishment of a prisoner.
The complainant at that time was placed in a cell similar to that of Karlsruhe during three months every day between 15 and 21 hours.
In recent weeks, the Berlin prisons had also come to the strikes because of lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are always included in 23 hours, which increases aggressivity, even to battle, because of the stressed situation.
According to the judicial press station, 21 places are not occupied in the tile due to a growing deficiencies, 19 are supposed to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to adopt it.
What happens to Germany?
Approximately 800 000 asylum candidates will come to Germany this year according to the Prognoses of the Federal Ministry of Industry, according to Vice-Canzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to take up a million refugees.
The Federal Cancer Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated decisiveness in view of the unusual challenge: "I say repeatedly, we can create this, and we can do it."
What happens to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) are used annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built so far (250000 apartments).
Dramaticly, however, the lack of living space is particularly in payable rentals: Annually 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these particularly favourable apartments refugees will also apply for.
Consequently, Federal Minister for Construction, Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
A lot too little is that from the view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing should be created annually, and for this the covenant would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister for Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the admission society, but also for the self-value of immigrants, says Migration Researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: the ban on the work of refugees to recognise work.
While there was a preliminary prohibition for asylum candidates from up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation restricted by asylum applicants to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the lack of experts, the majority of views have been made that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is missing German knowledge.
Until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most frequently distributed by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the royal route to work integration.
The Berlin School Management has found that only a few flourished parents give their children into the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speakers of youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
If the need for education increases significantly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes will be prepared for education.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack to them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Management.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no country of asylum candidates or tolerants dismiss the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student volunteers could facilitate access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or tolerance are no longer given services under the Asylum Consumer Service Act when they start a study.
In principle, the latter will not receive a bavity because they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to belonging to the bavity.
Duld refugees must have lived in Germany for four years until now in order to be entitled to be Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months.
This funding gap must be closed, however, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, for many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State Church Law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that is professionally careful for the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
In this way, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it certain controls.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the president of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to eliminate such conflicts in Germany, "has immediately their right to live here, confused in Germany," he said in the Bayrian broadcast.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today a topic of society.
This will also need to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, since a few decades of anti-discrimination and a general equivalence law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Similar opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the stakeholders demand for non-white Germans for a long time and for which international agreements, such as the anti-rassism Convention, Germany, will have to be real in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and uses its new citizens - to the good of all.
Generally, Germany is able to provide the refugees that have been expected to provide medical care, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As regards man power and capacity, we can do this," he said the daily level.
However, additional money must be flowed into the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid anxiety, Montgomery calls for all advocates to provide health cards at the time of registration.
Contributed benefits could later be charged with the federal countries.
And it is very questionable for the long term to eat so many people with the restricted performance catalogue provided for by the Asylum Consumer Act.
Otherwise, doctors are making the language barriers primarily.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, dolmetscher costs should be taken, it demands.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical posts in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
In the case of refugee children, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and in the young people it is about HIV disclosure.
However, with the partially other sickness pictures, German doctors came from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite case or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as to the doctor's theme angel, the refugees may even be familiarity in view.
The Syrians had a high-developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to practise, they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and may be able to test again.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany is psychologically ill according to estimated by the Federal Psychotherapeuts Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic disturbance or depression.
In particular, refugee children are vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent TU Munich study shows that every fifth Syrian refugee kid is traumatic in Germany.
Those who are sick of a posttraumatic disturbance suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breathing note, dizziness, heart rates and death fears.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong terribleness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
However, until now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees are given psychiatric therapy.
Although psychically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can make a request for psychiatric therapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, most experts or doctors who are not trained for psychiatric diseases would decide whether treatment is necessary or not.
This often leads to failure assessments, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new scenario "Leathership" the Circus Probst relapses to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to draw every age group in the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal foods and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the tile to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Junior Chief.
"Leathership" - under this motto is the current man-incentive.
For over 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift for enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people away from their everyday asshole and take them into a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Junior Chairman stresses.
"Manegencocktail with World City Fleir", so-called Director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in its ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the stupid films, it wants to take the Cuban duo more locker.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the Mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Besides many lax salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingerstone feeling and jointness.
Balance with the single wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of crustaceans are only too often topics in various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the position: "If our animals are not good, we too are not doing well."
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each streichle unit.
The "four-bened artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the manege.
So the highest command: care well for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a Shetland Ponyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, it is the unique mascott of the Circus Probst.
So for every visitor, it's supposed to be something with it.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst, "Everywhere five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites his ideas from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 a.m.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is the family day, for the idea at 17 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal view is open daily from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairway from the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly through the social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also deceived by claims by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with bow calls.
Last month, they had put him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned against disturbing Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Dead'," he said journalists according to Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as it leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that Morgan Tsvangirai's party was "angry" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected loss of employment leads to a load of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, which is intended to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be concentrated on the provision of unequivocal, integrated technology solutions for businesses", says a statement by the company.
It distributes a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to create electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has run a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide a better performance.
FC Arsenal Capitein Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Winger stressed Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation was planned, there is no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had completed the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old turn during the presaison.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Winger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his knees or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a pure medical viewpoint, but as Winger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has reported 23 different diseases by Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 Liga games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two League Premier Clubs in six out of eight times since 2007/08, which have most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will persist during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have an offensive period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting force," said Winger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Deathenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Winger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Winger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to give a little break," said Winger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue by group F, the Maxsimir Stadion in Zagreb belongs to the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also untrusted after 41 games after the "unquestionable" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by a earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Winger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League chapter against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope to lead the association to its first Europepokal triumph.
"This drive is huge," said Winger.
It's never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambiguous, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is evident, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In trying to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a disgraceful life) announced 2015 as the year of man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the battle to meet this challenge.
A current study with more than 2,000 high school school students with depressive symptoms found that, if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "snow mood", his chances for healing were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communications, with their focus on style about substance, the immediateness of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, violent and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This surface success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything on costs of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionary recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Every character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was glanced as a friend by interaction.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent arms, moments at football watching in cozy seats and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it at all, even though they often stop to explore their feelings completely.
As an employee of the telephone care explained to me, "my listener role for people who feel depressive and are threatened to suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech "I come with it" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is seen as weakness when speaking openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that come into mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status through the phone can help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the totally newly designed ballets of the day, why not bring your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting with Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move over to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Princess Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as PSG players who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before finally raised her proximity, when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they are seeking not only the qualification for the K.O. runs, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities before the gate. He was later exchanged in the game against his home city team and against the association with which he started his illustrous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which could hold a 2:2 disagreement on his own place against Bordeaux in the first League, but he was exposed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wingsstorm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why when he entered in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he concluded Johan Wiland beautifully in the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, arrived at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of the field a heavy opponent.
But with the exception of a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, who was far on Kevin Trapp's Pfosten in the 34th minute prepayment, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes resigned himself, with some mistakes and bad closures, not least by Ibrahimovic, who had been patched in the first half alone at not less than five trials and then dismissed after Cavani had restarted it.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic that di Maria turned into a turning shot, which was overwhelmed by Wiland in the 52th minute on the pound ...
The second gate eventually fell shortly after the hour-market thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayian reached its sixth seasonal tower after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could hold the end result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was admitted a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norweger said: "Our last champions-League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualification games are not sufficient."
Go ahead of Paris!
It was a great game of them!

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and Europe Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was evident a few years ago, just before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish Master, three times Pokal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already in Barcelona before the EM 2008.
"There was told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't win," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bayern."
"Rommenigge wanted me."
To remind: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not happen.
And the chief man is working for this today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why, "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the crew without me."
"That he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime would have run with Xavi 2008/2009.
Xavi was standing for Barca in the district final of the Champions League against the Bayers over the entire distance on the race, switching the reds out (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrating the Kings class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the afro-American film emacherin Effie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said that it is not needed behind the cults.
During a result of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actress Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives, with regard to a black protagonist in the selected turnbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then do it when you occupy the movie and not in the occupation of the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted disbelieving and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay" when the comments of the actor of The Martian were attached.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show fanists.
"I want to ask people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and it is a nut beaten by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People set himself for the Finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the governance of the film; Damon replied that their government "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was exposed, the social media exploded before disappointment about Damon's comments.
Twitter users Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Mat Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that is SO WISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since his publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racism representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the adolescent Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter achieved a country-wide effect and urged lawyers and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colourful content.
In February, the singer Prince made a play of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the movement of Black Lives Matter have published an explanation as a response to the question of Fox News Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The first athlete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the great price of $1 million home was Isaac Caldiero.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all stages of his obstacle parcours.
During the seasonal season, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, were created to the final.
The last task was the climbing of a 75-foot climbing seal in 30 seconds.
British finished the task within the time he was the first athlete who completed the efforting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster, which made him winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard fighting victory, still under the shock about the gain of the big price of 1 million dollars.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10.000 or lived," said Isaac E! about his amount of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he first finished the parcours, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's having any cruelty about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received lots of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be hit by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eight-stage, the turning work will begin in the spring 2016.
Detroit Tiger's passing to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They were once one of the best teams in the baseball, today the tigers stand at the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but this part played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros game for the second American League Wildcard site.
For Detroit, even for only one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to take over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon held his early opensive support upright, as Detroit three times in the first two innings points, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine lots.
"I want to finish strongly this year," said Simon.
It is difficult to throw in every game in the bullpen, and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swallowed the timber well," said the outmost.
He looked well out at the battle training, looked clearly better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunch, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designated smoker Miguel Sano, who entriss a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of leopards and the final run at the second, fortunes brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, wall created a RBI double against the closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stuck Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a non-moving Phil Hughes to play.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand-hand herd, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than one month because of a backlide.
"Of course not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I did and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Battery, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from the Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big stroke," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he took the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch Count, did not achieve any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliefer A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
MEASURES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez dismissed because of an injury of the scientists.

Ischinger: German military measures in Syria a option
The leader of the Munichn Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be possible.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He foretold the European states "colectively looking away".

Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained on the service night in the Austrian TV broadcaster ORF, and no one is now sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Michl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this respect.
Concrete figures did not call her and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, ten thousands of refugees had come over the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, asked for a special summit next week together with several other Heads of State and Government.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet agreed on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (22 September) on a special meeting, the EU Ministers want to take a new call for the binding distribution of 120 000 additional refugees.
In view of the strong refugee in Germany, the covenant wants to support the countries more in the first intake and distribution of people.
The covenant will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the late Tuesday night after almost four-hour discussions with the Ministers of the Kanzler's Office in Berlin.
Merkel underlined, the people who need protection also got this.
But whoever has no perspective of stay, can't also stay in Germany.
This opinion was definitively divided into the round.
The cansler stressed that the State as a whole must now handle a "great force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the night on Tuesday.

The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the tooth.
In Turkey, there are thousands of migrants who have been on the way to the Greek border because of eyewitness reports.
Space Sun "Cassini" finds the ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
A global ocean is swallowed under the icespan of the Saturnmond Enceladus.
Close researchers from observations of the space zone "Cassini".
Thus, the moon humbles easily on his track around the ring planet.
This Taumel movement is only small, but still too large for a continuously solid heaven body, says in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the Icarus section.
Once longer, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturnmond, eating the water vapour and particles and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of the Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be a underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must leave about a month at Valdet Rama.
A study has caused an injury of the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Lions, the diagnosis means "predictably four weeks of compulsory break".
"That's hard for us, Rama's a herbless loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the "Image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a ununited professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixty first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already contracted at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the possibility to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the crew stroke after his brain shaking next week.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the course training.
Ocotie had been injured in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a severe collapse on the head.
In contrast to the first fears, however, he remained without a serious blessment.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain lots of sugar
Mangos are exotic and saft-sweet.
But whoever wants to look at his slank line, this is often more disrupted by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially saccharosis.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins and vitamins E and C are in them. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pregnancy of beta-carotin.
Those who eat the fruits thus support the vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell at purchase.
The shell color alone doesn't matter how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
You should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
However, a mango also gives heartfelt courts a special note.
It faints the light bitter taste of some sheet salates like Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well for fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS will restore up to 95000 aids for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, the UPS informed on Tuesday.

First feetstorm, then marked cold front
In the next night the valleys of the Alps north side of the feet break through, as meteo-switzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the feet blows partly with storm strength through the feet valleys.
After feeting on Thursday morning, we cross a marked cold front that brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep-pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alps North side breaks in the night to the Wednesday of the feet through the valleys.
As a result, the feet blows to Thursday morning in the feet valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, combined and in particular in the Urnerland, partly with more than 100 km/h.
The feather can go to the neighbouring Mediterranean, and on the mountains even orcan bows of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north, on Wednesday, the stormy feet provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to be stuck on the southern Alps.
Sets the rains that stop until Thursday night.
In sum, in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, it must be estimated to be partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter, which has already fallen large rains in recent days.
On Thursday morning the feet leaves the air, as a result, a cold front rolls with strong, partially violent rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go significantly down.
The following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be sunnyer and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized on Wednesday on the name of the German Reformator.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now advocated as "German Theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name gift had been applied for by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
On Wednesday, Jens-Martin Kruse, priest of the Evangelical-Luther municipality in Rome, reminded that the Protestants in the city of the Popes were often able to live as a minority only in secrets.
With the place, in symbolic way, it will be visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustiner monk around 1510/11 a few months in Rome.
He felt the city then as a prodigal sin babel.
His negative impressions, according to historians, would have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening church with his theses against the sales trade.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (forgotten) dorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel that has now appeared with beautiful pictures.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives produced his entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "speaking" with colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - but it is not a matter of meaning with "good" pictures.
On the contrary, adapting the respective topics can be quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjektiv artistic selection of the many topics of the "book of all books".
Entrances are cycles that devote to themes such as crossways, plagues, commandments or fathers.
So he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publisher with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Oldepost, who has interacted with the respective texts on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Biblical quote of Martin Luther and each of the artist's sentences, which form his entire personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows a double deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grown up in Berlin, come from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Mr.huter words.
"Then the education happened with the pipestock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I've tried to work that up to perhaps to convey me with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help the art again to more value in a fast lifetime: "The perception of image worlds is today characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolics are disappeared there.
Artists have another desire and win to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "invade" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have, "The image is looking for his counter."
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "very always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands his pictures of life."
Old did not take full account of the Bible, but chose the important, also mysterious topics for it.
"This wasn't a collaboration at eye height," says Oldepost, "This is about the pictures that the text explains only." It was a picture-bibel.
For Hans Möhler from the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Old's pictures speak for moulders both the (biblical) language of love and the of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX train nearby
Plans made, found place, companies ordered, earth hills for a round course modelled: A year later almost everything was finished, but before the official opening of the BMX trains, it was done again.
Defects in politics and administration led to disturbances, especially in the people who would not tolerate the trains.
So hills disposed, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction authorisation.
The authorization will be entered in October, the first municipal council Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now inform the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year still happens visible," she said.
It was then to be started without a "extended memorial break" with the work at the former hall bath.
DFB intensifies engagement for refugees
The DFB extends its engagement for refugees until 2019, the Federal League sets a clear sign in the weekend.
The football reacts to the facing situation in Germany and ensures its help in tackling the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reconciliation."
"Nobody can in principle say that it doesn't matter to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be interesting for each individual to handle this topic," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to intensely discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I am next Wednesday at the office of the Cancilians and I meet the Minister of State Ms. Özoğuz and the Kanzler."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
The decisive softness, however, must set the policy.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some stateligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will bear the "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricotary instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo.
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusens Sportschef Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (serviceday) and called the project "self-consciousness".
"The refugee droma is going on everybody, nobody can see away."
"We can football allies, no, we need to use our ray power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hopfenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
For the EM-qualification game against Hungary this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 license associations in their places had started their own projects were great.
Similarly, small and small associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have published is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and the next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees each.
"The associations have already picked up the total for 2015," explained Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Board of Directors loses an eye in the event of accidents
The head of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye by a crash in early July.
When the accident on the stairway of his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water that he had carried in the left hand, reported the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleededed, was absurd, then slept out on the street - that he told us so last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could take care of his work.
"In the beginning of October we meet before the Board of Supervisors in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "full of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "South German newspaper" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software groups.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
"I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually pends between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP Central in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the SZ: "Everyone can happen like that."
"It's important to resist once you've fallen."
McLaren-Replacepilot Magnussen except fighting ...
Magnussen twitted an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
Therefore, he will be as little as a spare driver during night racing in Singapore in the weekend for the two pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the great price of Japan.
Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus have definitely broken down in the first team game of the European League.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the football bundesliga in the duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./sky).
"We are unfortunately unable to react to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Federal Leverkus Top game on Sunday, the BVB Coach opened: "We expect a return from him to his training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribe on the giant position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weedfells in the future are used in all Europe-League games, however, made touchlet open.
With a high probability, he will also defy the second party.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final input for the BVB in Europe League must be the goal, middle-field player Julian Weigl thinks it is possible to imagine: "That is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robots cars: Government wants a pre-trade role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the Federal Government when changing the car of technological pre-residents.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility age" on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the IAA Automesse.
The automated and networked driving will increase transport safety and provide less vacuum, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, which also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The Transport Ministry's Strategy Paper underlines, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and the rapid transition to digital radio.
For the purpose of testing new techniques, there is currently a test line on the motorway 9 in Bayern.
In order for the driver to be "no additional liability risks", the Federal Government wants to "control the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany wants to use some internationally for the maximum speed of automotives to be increased from 10 to 130 hours.
The Federal Government also wants to take action to amend the Vienna Convention, which is to see only people as drivers.
When automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds fast.
Following a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatized driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, rideless vehicles on public roads are "awaiting most far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driving resistance systems and high-automatized driving functions at the location of Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to approximately EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the truck can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD transport policymaker Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly explained.
However, the German automobiles still see sceptic - much more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute, presented on Wednesday at the AA, ordered by the Dekra Test Organization, results in the fact that only eight percent of the Germans believe that automobiles will be able to operate in the coming ten years, 32 percent will only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents expect to drive automotive by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Without this, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-running vehicle.
After a collection of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give control on all roads during the entire journey.
On the motorway, this could be represented by 15 percent in the flowing traffic, 45 percent in the stable.
Well every four would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Tischtennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants only to be able to look at the title struggles from September 25 to October 4th.
The final decision shall be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough, even without Timo to get the title," said Federal Trainer Jörg Rosßkopf during the EM learning in Düsseldorf.
Bolt was at that time on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsor date in China.
The 34-year-old German Master is expected to be back on Friday.
"Unless Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who is leading to the setlist in Jekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM in Schwachat in 2013.
"To that time, Timo also missed, and we have become Europe champion."
"We should focus on this," explained the world orderlist fifths.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has led to a serious injury on the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit and exchanged after long treatment at a takling by Héctor Moreno.
The first diagnosis showed a rail bone break on the 20-year-old partner of Bastian pig riser.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion view and a wax-figure barbecue: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Display window pops that look terrible by video projections.
They carry the spectacular creatures of the French designer, which became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things, and thus he put men in bucks.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin Couture because I have white hair."
"From the time it was bleeded, in the meantime it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Citizen to the Run Step) to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation of 18 September, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his initial rejecting attitude to a view of his person.
Actually he had been against it, because, "For me an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you'll come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographical overall artwork for which much effort was carried out: To froze the pops, for example, a stylist was engaged in.
14 tons of material, according to the courator Thierry-Maxime Loriot has carved to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was a special smancher: a leather-hosen outfit with corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, conscious fashionful fashionful gap attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football), he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He taught himself afterwards the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own mode view, he couldn't pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the climbs.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze als Mode-Nische
Earlier it went to the long sticking machines and around grinding about making meters.
The covered fabrics and peaks were in a large amount for customers, for example, that they were further processed to covers and gardins.
This alone doesn't work anymore today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, manager of the fashion top Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
Mode played a greater role in the early times of the Plauen's peak, then dispersed by the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a nose.
Reinhardt calls some examples: peak in jewelry, for accessories such as bags and for regional struggles.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which relys on past styles, is an increasing potential for jobs.
Whoever does not use fish in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us they already make half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is joined with nine other companies in the Branch Association of Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only they may carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been broken away.
Private businesses and the wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching customers in this way.
The massware is produced much cheaper in the Asian space today and is almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakened, currently to Russia and to the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also attempts to point through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "We have been conducting a quality seal this year, which shows that we produce ecological and socially tolerable production."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snowberg outside of the Western Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and is specialized in climbing and peaks.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses that have to think mainly economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied to hold a customer's stem.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter renewed the historic snowball peak.
The machine sticks in some places small hills.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired of it: "I couldn't start with a traditional Plauen-top."
Now she uses the snowball peak for her jewelry.
In an enthusiastic procedure, she puts the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region are identifying themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plagues and surroundings and who want a memorial piece.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen's tip.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" movie
You should not touch legends, but Disney still dares to a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not a new filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the World Economic Crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director already stands: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy needs to open widely outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group responsible for the management of the reform.
"China should be engaged in attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business founding strategies," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will lead to new turn and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access regulations, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SEO), the inclusion of private capital, and the overcoming of the inhabitants' reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up, identifying sectors and companies which are not in question for investments.
The system is repeatedly tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important, since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the Statement said.
The government will also attract controls on the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how they are conducting their businesses.
The Statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policy against foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the Statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activities and to take professional judges and lawyers was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also took part in Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the mercury limit value in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large robbers and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nervous toxicity.
The Consumer Organisation Foodwatch, which has a relevant EU work paper, criticized the plans sharply: "Risks and adverse reactions faulted industrial and environmental policy are being furthered with full weight on pregnant and young children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nervous toxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as hai or sword fish for "economic reasons" will be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large robbery fish have been so severely charged with mercury that, on the basis of the still applicable limit values, about 50 percent of the catches should not be sold.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14,5 percent would be incurred.
In contrast to this locking, the EU, according to foodwatch, wants to reinforce the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "Trick", because smaller fried fish, such as carps, are mostly so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction manuscript that helps the economy alone", explained Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilver is a high-toxic heavy metal for humans, which reaches the food chain strongly, especially in robbery.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "prepared small amounts can cause especially in the event of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage in terms of the existing maximum levels that a "health threat to the general population" is not expected.
Quecksilver comes mainly through the combustion of carbon into the environment.
According to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Environment, the German Coal Power Forces are exposed to Annalena Baerbock's Green-Day member, more than six tonnes of mercury in Germany, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as in Elbe, Rhine and Donau, was "continually overwhelmed and overlapping", the "spegel" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings for mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
