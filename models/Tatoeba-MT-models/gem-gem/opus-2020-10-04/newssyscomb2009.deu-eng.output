Triumph of the right-populists in Austria, a total of 29 per cent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the large coalition to date and a significant strengthening of the legally-popular parties brought the preferred elections of the parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria after the first provisional results.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OEPP) suffered losses, where the position of the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the hill.
In contrast, the Electoral Head of the League for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landhaupt Jörg Haider, is prepared for a triumphant return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country by 29.8 per cent of votes, but with the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 per cent of the votes.
Even worse cut off the OVP, which loses almost nine percent of the voices by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the people's party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP had expelled from the coalition, the people's party had a clear forespring before the SPÖ.
However, the voters probably punished the party for having the government failed.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible withdrawal from the party chairman and previous vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the electoral debt, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legally-popular parties - the Freedom Parties (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the Popular Agreements (this time the FPÖ was still unified, it split off from the BZÖ in 2005) in respect of a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
It is evident that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is going from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Party of the Greens joined the House, which suffered mild losses, but which abolished from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably missed the four-percentury and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to resolve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India for the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg considers that a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could come.
This was stressed by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian official colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this isn't clear, then surely it comes to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions that in judicial matters, the executive could only be difficult to intervene.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a penalty penalty, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in which the case falls.
"Their problem could be cleared," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, which was sentenced to three years of freedom, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he would go to appeal at a higher institution.
He could ask for release for deposit and wait in freedom for his judgment, said the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, then would be questionable for him," said the Chief of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the condemned "competent legal support" to the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK confirmed the Czech Republic's importance to the problem of Czech entomologists before his partner.
"We really think it's a big mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister rejected.
"Mir was already promised quite much," he just found.
A Czech is directed over ringing around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself", says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed teams of the UN Division of Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it on and on.
Here workelan and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the sea ground is a very little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, the wider herb and other non-adulting raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, have the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground, larger than the mainland
Today, the landowner states reported their right to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is particularly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country, according to the Convention, has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the sea, often also the limit of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the corresponding country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications by Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently encountered Australia's success, which as the first country could significantly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor that the Commission approved last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times greater than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
As they promise, they will have an invaluable value in the future of the use of the sea floor.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil, which is referred to as "the common heritage of mankind" by the Convention begins.
This is where no state has a special position.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a gold grave land," says a little overdrive Director Mikulka and adds that "some areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Block under the Joint Organisation Interocean Metal.
This was given in 1991 on the basis of the Convention, as well as the investors of some lesser countries, the status of a so-called "trailbreaking investor".
The organisation has the right to promote the area ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich founding site of polymetallic circuits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, the Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a convergence as a pattern.
It reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary sham that raised the Golem legend to life.
German specialist forces were on-site at hostage exemption
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
About the circumstances of the liberation of 11 kidnapped European tourists in Egypt, more and more details are known.
Indirectly, according to the Defence and Interior Ministry, German specialists were also involved in the rescue action.
Accordingly, both experts in the Federal Army and officials of the GSG 9 were the Flight Staffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminalam and the Logistics Experts of the Technical Aid at the Place of Liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the Ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Happyly it hasn't happened," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
An attacker had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19, in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Chad had been swooped and swollen.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the last time as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued people have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were commissioned in the guard of the German message.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "picture" stage, the five holidays and the special forces are to be flyed out with an airbus of air weapons and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has hardly failed the 700 billion dollars heavy saving package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went out into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the financial market rescue package of the government.
Despite all the appeals by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to reduce the chaos to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the beneficiaries desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke up by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were worried about the fact that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after notice of the failure, to crash again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, it is necessary to agree with both the House of Members and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In the case of travel bookings for the next few months, the turnover increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic perspectives, Germans’ travel desire remains untrusted according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a sales rate of 31 per cent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) informed on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation by the GfK Market Research Institute, booking figures have also been increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover of the travel agencies for October was about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results is the figures of the GfK that evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculated high for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States in particular was asked, the DRV informed.
Here the booking increase is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece and the local filling are travel destinations that are particularly demanded by the Germans.
In particular, holiday trips are high in the course, explained president Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for customers than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that again a salesplus would be recorded compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from litre crowns and promise in designer-dirndln.
A shower debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV modern and wears a customized dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Just three minutes on the grass, the photographers already fall on us and knock the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first visit.
That's how you get friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and in fact north of the white-wheat spectacle, the well-being remained in borders until then.
But first of all, it's half that bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather hoss; no one looks reversed or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocobanan stand only harvest my dirndlances.
A monkey makes me aware that I would have misbound the short: "Lefts hoast free, middle virgin, right forgive, back widowed."
Secretly, I'll fry the loop from behind to the left.
"Pass," it said and laughs.
Others make less efforts for subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filthy hats on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked rear part to an unbetten.
The young man with the exhibitionistic attitudes is Bob, comes from England and also attends the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he lost his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of which thinks he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these famous "wildbiezers".
Others do not have the luck of losing the alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, healthcare professionals are running over the festival place that needs to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the bar - always four at a time dragging a covered cargo of tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
If you're in the promille sarg below the plane, you can't see.
"These are the ones where goartakers pack," one of the sanitaries called me on request and disappeared in the dirt.
Name of the accident sacrifice announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspect of lightweight riding.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, European powers were interested in deeply entering Turkey's backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, emperoric struggle.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building is riding at the end of the railroad with a tower at each corner of the front side and thus looks like any provincial German Councilhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is roughly broken
But once you are within the waved cart switch, there is no doubt of the excellence of the project whose western access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late in the imperialist game, had to do so before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and further according to what is Saudi Arabia today.
However, Germany's imperialistic project was enlightened during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the inconsistent borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces kicked out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gate to anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The governing Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a peculiar new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a approach policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian division groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a holprige ride on slices that produced the parallel of the old world in the famous documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered as a new city, for the new worldly state project to return to the osmanic past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused some of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the ACP's main business office, a specially designed, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a growing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and cuffs in which middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party of Europe.
Coat, Krawatte, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's external policy is now to reinforce Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its backland.
Today, she must look at the east and the west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or another.
She had to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "twould be to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "I didn't want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are of the same advantage for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel on eastern eastern railway railways towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's railway station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at that time there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford’s musical leader since 1962, Vernon was "Dood" Handley (after call on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonics and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth chore, Proteus, in the following year.
He was intended for youths up to 21 years, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and was alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been read for years.
How often death thought to "leave the music to speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing!"
His type of conduction was absolutely clear and precise, but never prevailing.
Regardless of the musical level, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any dirigent should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was the rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated dirigents who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two known sculptures in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a writer's remark in Woodruff's book "Besides Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universitys of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black-white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me attentive to her because of their ease and because of the power that they radiate, as they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sales with Honda.
In November, Honda is captured by the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior space, this large-space limousine offers a significantly larger.
This also includes the technical units that enable even more convenient driving and gasoline savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, as aesthetically, the new Jazz has a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this great limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most sold car of 2002 and also during the year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with some half a million sold cars in six years.
Yet Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which are 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
Exactly considered, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8 % compared with the previous year (1.6 %).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2 % in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese producer’s market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The publication of the Insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 inches ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 inches) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, leading to the assumption that it has become 5 inches larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success, on the one hand, is due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the bagroom, which has a system of double charge surface, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation's bagroom.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz bagroom is 379 litres with a 1.2 litres benzine engine.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment elements such as Leader seats or the possibility of integrating panorama windows, access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time provides rotation power for the entire engine running time.
The first 1.2 litre version achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min ?1 .
This gas engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reached 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of fuel consumption and carbon emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene' that avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight depends on bees' swimming behavior and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co's Technical Development Centre have developed these small robots in collaboration with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan security sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
However, the most important are the Face Eyes of the Bee, which can see over a 300 degree angle in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To imitate the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles that are located before the BR23C in the distance of up to two meters and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a boardy microprocessor which is translated directly into the signal for avoiding the collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by rotating his wheels around 90° or even greater angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference between other systems is that this exception is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot vary up or down, but not overear; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not into the endless directions and in an infinite way how it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to prevent the small robot from collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and to act according to this information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the conducted manoeuvres, so it can continue working with just a few thousand KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of the collisions, a technology that Nissan will propose to introduce in the series cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and keep longer than diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target while driving and avoid obstacles on the road.
She's on the shaking before being loaded with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the United States Ministry of Finance, except that it has an adequate liquidity to provide support, but not without a chance.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of US citizens in the hypothesis of the claimed payable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the Distortion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but no details.
This is rather a page for teenagers than a place for all audiences.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which is the first bank in Japan that will spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a renewal resulting from a strong case of its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley tribal forces will buy at the same price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The estimated price is below 19% of the rate value of the stock of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure her a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a single average price of $29, that is, 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 6.79% by $23.07 by $17.00 GMT.
`This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank', explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of the Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The methods presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
A week ago, in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, director of the MUFG, we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal powers.
However, in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and safeguard ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their rate value.
And the business will take place with a reduction in the profit by approximately 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half its preferential shares into tribal powers in one year if the latter are exchanged into more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance has been reduced since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange rate went down by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity speeded to the height.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivors of the large investment banks on the Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch purchase, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly abolished at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic re-founding socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venetian Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his equals and friends, it was that the plan of a new Constitution was set for choice.
Mission fulfils because, according to 80% of votes in vote, the public results were 64% in the referendum with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% were in line with 'No', 7% of the lists were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, a vote must be achieved by more than half of all votes delivered.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the elections and a counting of a non-governmental organisation had announced a clear victory for 'Yes' and prophesied 63% to 70% to him.
In the night from Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had in Guayaquil, the government's seat 280 km southwest of Quito, assured and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean equal-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The elections held in breast-feed in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text of 444 points in order to safeguard the 'new socialism' for which the President is working.
The Constitutional Project transfers government power to the economy by leaving it the only right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and the exchange rates that emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be promoted by the 2006 selected Correa, also grants the Head of State a comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of every four years and will have the possibility to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living in 50% of the population below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also provides for prohibiting the presence of foreign troops, which will bring an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial support point as a starting point for American anti-Drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the desert for 11 days, were brought back healthy and uninsured to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military support point al-Maza at 15.30 a.m. just next to the international airport of Cairo.
They were brought directly, without speaking to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers were 'no ransom paid', explained the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After being captured on September 19 at a land car safiri at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly approached by 35 unknown kidnappers from a concealment.
It is 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guardian and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before the morning damping.
`On both sides shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remainder fled', said this responsible who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is just located, about the role of secret agents and elements of Italian special units.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom was paid.
On the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a landing vehicle in a patrol where the kidnappers were, of which they were six, including the Chad leaders, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebellion group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, disputes this movement immediately.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a key topic of the current election campaign.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will rise and cruel sums that are granted to small museums, to archives, to archaeological excavations or to national historical places that are hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as in Canada, which effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides € 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec's history companies, at least 40,000 officials who are assembled in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, to save a few big ones the numerous private archives and to obtain archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the strength of despair when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and culture heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states of the Belgian Fortis Bank in Turbulence, which has been encountered by the U.S. financial crisis, want to take part in the arms of the Belgian Fortis Bank: the three countries make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the Banking and Insurance Institute, which is also established in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level in the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions which are now taken in connection with the bank could have a precedential character.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank to approximately 49 per cent.
The Bank will probably sell some of its shares, all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios were already recorded.
However, analytists agree that the bank with its 85.000 employees is too large for a plague.
The institute's securities fell by 12% to a 14-year depth on Friday.
Since Jensen, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the insecurity caused by it on the markets is due to the valleys of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interesting person with an appropriate offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it was said.
There is no panic among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stumbled.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies their own.
Fuchs in the chickenstal
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust in the fuchs the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the tracking of prescription data.
Insurances shall determine fees and amounts of payment in the case of injury depending on the condition of the customer, and should the risk be estimated too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years by the pharmacists, speaking what preparations were bought, and the program calculates from which disease the client suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol lowering medications, it would result that his blood fat levels are untreated, which would automatically put it into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance only needs to do more the paper crap, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the view of the insurers, while the above not mentioned.
For querying and processing the data, their own companies have formed which, before they refer to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Nowadays they have to do this by law, although failures have not yet been executed.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with the data on the use of medicines, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use at the same time becomes more difficult.
Although there is a private privacy law for health data, its effect is only on health care providers and insurance providers.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which means that the authorities could also control data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be distributed with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned is unable to prohibit access to his data, as the insurance is not a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only left somehow the grace of the fox.
Global Food Plan from Marseille
The European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are the leading trade partners of each other, this was the main topic in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today the French-Indian Summit also takes place, which is discussed mainly on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more voices and voting rights in international affairs, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's nineth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomate Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A agreement was made to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to increase to over 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the trade between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also legally summarised for an agreement, so that in the future air transport will be flexible.
By 2009 India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one of India, New Delhi is only a nineth of the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
These were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which was strongly condemned by both sides. The call for a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed and both sides are blamed for failure.
The EU stressed that it holds its energy and climate programme, i.e. that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a global compromise at the future climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the call for an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, contracts to French companies are hoped to be worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to Agency notifications, the Agreement is intended to be decided at 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right acquisition.
The international Frankfurt book fair is expected for the current event over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present over 403.000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony at the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264qm large exhibition "Punto Italy".
There will be a press conference next to the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives are discussed around the publishership in Italy.
According to data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but in particular in the adult and youth sector.
A year ago, Steve Fossett's little plane was re-funded.
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight across the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely defended the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troop was sent. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flooded on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human survivors were found in the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent for a few hours after the flight was watched, which identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal items of Fosset were found from a couple near their house to the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two exhibitions named Fossetts, which were both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration by illunes, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he managed to surround the worldball in a heating air balloon in the sixth time: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he surrounded the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Among his several records, a height flight of 15445 m above the Andes is also counted, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls from the traditional schemas through its original design and the special line conduction, the exhausting surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath with this offroader.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new thing in the automotive sector in behind Italy.
A project with a maximum effort that will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, which Corso Como, will be carried out by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in the form of 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como, which are intended to provide a special optic: the new Suv will appear as a three-dimensional model in its nearly real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is pictured.
In this context, using the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments to reconcile itself again as a whole.
No doubt it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of authorsclame in this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in traveling the interests of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the ban of the stadium
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has been traveling for years afterwards by the Italian national team and who, honestly, have caused no serious problems until recently.
Never has ever been in conflict with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori, which the cities of the military appear on: these were, however, far away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a conflict with a truly right radical fanscene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided 144 cards to the Italian fans for the game: all were exhibited by name and thus easily controlled.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those travelled to Sofia, there was no one with a running stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian crew, which were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a at least five-year stadium ban.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation practices, which could follow these fewer than 150.
"This fire must be exposed immediately, and that does not in any case give the possibility of justification," says the Viminal.
That's why, "eye on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
For there is actually a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisor) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the ais, i.e. the secret services that are dealing with the problem of the stadium power.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (explicitly expressed in no joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to commend the Duce, but it was undoubtedly a shame to be conducted by these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the No 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are being sanctified in the country of action.
Until now, this group had been held in vain, but now needs to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymne of Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, they allow me, but there is no education...".
