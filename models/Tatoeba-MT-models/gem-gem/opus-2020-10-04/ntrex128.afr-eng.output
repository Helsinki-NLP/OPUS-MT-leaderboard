Members of the Wallian Assembly worried they're going to look like fools.
There are arts among some meeting members on the proposal to change their title of AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can provoke a mock.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it's with TWP and Pwp rim."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conserwative Party says his group is "receptible" about the change of name, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Wallan letter w is expressed as the Yorkshire-English statement of the letter you.
The meeting commission, which is currently drafting legislation to set up the name changes, said: "The final decision on any description of what is called members of the meeting, will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Wallan meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received widespread support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the AM's title, the Commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
Am's seemingly suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who in weeks must present a legal proposal on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the work of the meeting, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last thing to say in the question of what they should be mentioned when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change in country’s name
Choosers will vote Sunday or their country's name must change to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to remove a decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens already demands for a long time that the name of his neighbour in the north represents a claim in its territory and repeatedly took up his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including First Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are getting silent because churches in Harlem have trouble.
'Historically,' said the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church on every corner,' said Mr. Adams.
"No one of the two is there anymore today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Men today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Crues are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As regards churches, he is worried that the money from bath sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, because most of the people who enter into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation who worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boikot from retailers in the 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members had planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carilion.
Eerw. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carilion "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carilion in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a unreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What plays at Saint Martin's in the last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the league leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal bisdom.
The church council, the congregation's management body, consisting of league leaders - wrote to the bisdom in July with anxiety that the bisdom "will try to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bisdom.
Some congregation members complain about a lack of transparency from the side of the bisdom.
Haw injured 13-year-old on crawl diving in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and hurts when he dug for crab on the first day of the cream season in California, says officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cried for help and then ‘ robbed closer to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first crawl catch, but then he realized "that he called, 'I was bite!
I'm bite!"
All his key bone was broken up," Hammel saw when he came out to the son.
"I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known what shark species is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media information session that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries at the upper part of his body.
Officers closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan for enlargement to the UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Super Drugs and Debenhams fight with branch shop-type beauty courses caught by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2,8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homeware fall back, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 shops across the country and if a success has been taken next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill rocks used once for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's say that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Beast will also get more space with trademark specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique rear series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers demand.
In addition, the parfum dealer, The Fragrance Shop concessions will test in two Sainsbury shops, of which the first last week in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local comfort shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops will look more like branch stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the shops Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsburys have placed Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years back, which, according to their herbal sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsburys tested a joint company with Boots in the early 2000s, but the ratio ended after an argument about how the profit from the pharmacists should be divided within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 shop of pharmaceuticals for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our series of trade names were designed to provide every need and the intriguing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a vigorous destination of beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'wrathful' after Holly Willoughby retired to £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'wrathful' after the TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrawn her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home clothes and accessibility trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced at Instagram that she would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones wrathfully by withdrawing at the last moment their profitable lifestyle trading brand-activity - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was angry when TV's gold girl Tuesday at an excited meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new occasions - worth up to £1.5 million - means that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessibility trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would have doubled, according to devoted Willoughby’s estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a ray and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid to all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the release.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that make most money in, can chase the company millions out of the pocket due to the huge investment in products stretching from kissings and candles to clothes and home clothes, and the possibility that its release may meet even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined in March as chairman.
The couples keep vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark embassy for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business matters."
Heavy words 'and then we get in love'
He was ridiculous about the criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber--"News Reader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a great step to the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June leader's convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "compliant reaction" from the U.S.A. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the US continues penalties aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We progress excellently with North Korea," he said."
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in positive results - it ended raket tests, helped to liberate hostages, and causes the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this stampful arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there," said Trump while he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tacholf and earthquake in Indonesia devastates island, killing hundreds
In the follow-up of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations have been told that they are not required.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population have been disturbed, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalyst international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a little difficult," said me. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the land remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a common vision on other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning iron in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of power.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's confused infrastructure a key point of his election campaign and was indisputablely spending money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is struggled with funding deficiencies as he faces reselection next year.
Mr. Yoko also stands before the pressure of slacking sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim Majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of unthemed like Christian and Muslim gangs with cutting knives, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge shouts good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he shot far to the target stake.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball thrumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to come to the ball, and players like Shaq always playing forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edges come and typed one time and didn't think too much about it and just shot."
Chelsea was at half time 1-0 before after the Belgian star Eden Hazard set a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head played back to Mateo Kovacic again in that playground before he told near the middle field and shaved in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then introduced for Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left foot-scoop passing Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the main target net.
Liverpool runs on Wednesday at 3 p.m. the fight against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League in front of Videoton.
Death rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death count in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed up to 832, said the country’s disaster agency Sunday early.
It has been reported that many people were trapped under the waste of buildings that hit the earthquake on Friday at a range of 7.5 and caused burners of up to 20 feet, said the Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was poured with the ruins of collapseed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews in John Street at 7.55 and a 32-year-old man was suspected of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who heard or saw anything to move forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is in a early stage, but I appeal to anyone who was in the surroundings of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they can have information that may be indispensable to us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Research is continued because the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speakless when he discovered what had happened.
Inhabitants are now said that it will take hours before they are released again.
A police officer told one man that the whole area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, 'It's so horrible.'
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers have been left within the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anybody with information is asked to switch @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or anonymously link Crimestopers at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial with 'rewrite of history' disputes
His exile will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "suiteness" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the formation of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagestorming of the English Civil Wars was still commanded by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s manifold depict of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century’s opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believes are still memorial.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defendant of the parliament against external pressure, of course in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation, is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is firmly that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave form to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizeable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and anniversary."
Murdvark Extended Chinese Boer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified by the side of, "Yuan," was found with a scattered artery with blood covered death near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of the province of Qinghai, China.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and found a door to a neighboring pig cage open.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A Forensian investigation confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pounds pig had biten the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, who was mentioned on the side of, "Wu," the Guiyang Evening News quoted.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belongs not to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager said to the Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds of pig had caught a Walesian farmer against his tractor until his wife had scared the beast.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "sneller".
"They're just playing.
They're picks, very curious... they're not looking for hurting you.
You should just show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Travel from Orcan Rosa is about to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.A.
As foretold, Orcan Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 orchant, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a troll over the Pacific begins to take form and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northwest of the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in response to the approaching trawl will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous swift floods, waste flows, and possibly soil crashes in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates from up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Kits floods may be with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to risk to walk into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - sealed rivers to touch and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching truck will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain rates of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth railways.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainbuis will be late Sunday and early Monday begin to approach before the rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the US as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the Central US is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, decreasing summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the Central and Eastern US October will begin warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Layer to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher risk of boge average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh-interrogation.
Over 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the attractive witness of High Court Attendant Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault claimed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-tick-the-ticking turn: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford said to the Senate Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh stuck her in drunkenness and tried to pull out her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, reports Nielsen.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an explanation that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where objectors screamed at him when he tried to take a elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with depressed eyes, while CNN was alive stating how he was said badly.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued an explanation and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have to say more at the committee interrogation.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all hours later living when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he will only do this with the mind that the FBI will look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, like what the Democratic Minority has requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake took his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set up a FBI investigation on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accused critics of 'political game' about Brexit
First Minister Theresa May has critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political playback" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's First Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conserwative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview along with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should recover each other's tariffs was 'completely ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-grade murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the bullying.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on it, reports CBS-affilled WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde.
His guarantor was determined at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
On Friday, the court office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was a gun in the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's Refugee Task Force, the State Police's Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and District Citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Allva thanks for the area law application for his "yes and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per race.
Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said the team in "buckled" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you're worried about," said Wayde.
Vulcan spook ashes on Mexico City
As from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital have reached.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater had picked up activity and registered about 24 hours 183 releases of gas and as.
The center monitored multiple droughts and shakings.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas covers motor windscreens near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophisists have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has been sitting 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital since a earthquake with a range of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalonian separatists before celebration of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independency protesters were in conflict with criticism politics, and thousands joined contradictions to commemorate the first Memorial of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for resignation.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by unhappy police, poured with eggs and powder painting that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wear from tourists.
Later on the day, a grooming also broke out, and the police had to use their knupples to control the fighting.
In several hours, pro-independency groups sang on one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionist's cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for small injuries in the processions, the local press reported.
The tension remains high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatis-Catalanes.
Electors voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those opposed to abstinence who mainly boikoted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent conflicts to prevent the voting at the voting rooms throughout the region.
Pro-independency groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we had been through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote but now stick us," he said.
Despite a vital but nail-scraped victory in regional selections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders, either in self-delegated exile or in precarse for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in prejudice since late last year, announced that he would stand in European parliamentary elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove the decline in democratic values and the oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested by car at home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had repeatedly caught a house in Londonderry.
The intent evolved Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagdsingel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage was caused at the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot to the car at a time.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston guarantees victory
Promoted Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 competitions as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was to demonstrate the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to the second.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Prime Ministership without a removal, and next week faced the precursors of Heart, which are their eight points ahead.
First Thursday, Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna in the European Liga.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unoverwhelmed loop in the division to six competitions, with head trainer Holt who still hadn't tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances for bot visitors
Holt's team must have gone ahead long before they had signed a goal, with their breast-feeding that Rangers had taken on all kinds of problems.
SR broke through, but weared before the target hok, then AL could only play wide after he had approached and CH’s headquarters met across the target hockey.
The hosts were satisfied to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadly toys.
And thus the decisive purpose came.
Rangers lost a freescope and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated but could not push through the home defense, and target guarder Liam Kelly was mainly unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turn of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers targeter Allan McGregor and Lithgow was writing wide to avoid still open game of Livingston.
Crossovers repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and stopped repeatedly, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were rejected.
‘Fenomenal’ of Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward job.
Their game style and crew have been almost unchanged since their return to the first place, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his handy defense order, while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they at times under Gerrard, they were unable to comply with those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could penetrate through the home team, which is somewhat of a week's call for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan get mixed receipts in Cologne
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (29 September) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a failure to deal with issues that include human rights, freedom of press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then allowed Köln to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted certainty reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurdish – also made their voices thick and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as heroes and crushed out by others as an autoocrat.
Deptford road accident: Bicycler dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London with a car involved.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officers work on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road locks and bus circuits were placed, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards in disturbance injured
Six guards were injured in a rebellion at a high-security prison, said the prison office.
Revolution broke out about Sunday 09:30 BST and is still in progress at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialists-"Tornado guarders" were invited to handle the rebellion, including eight prisoners and limited to one wings.
The guards were treated on the scene for small facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to pay attention to a continuing intact at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible for the police will be referred to and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief captain of the prison had received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unhappy officers were invited to pay attention to serious disorders in which staff with billion balls were attacked.
Orchestra Rosa Trug Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflute (Drying Areas Trek Dal Benefits)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week if Orcan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwest desert and brings quick flow risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued quick flood wakes for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route on Tuesday over Phoenix, and late on Monday will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcan Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the US Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely receive 1 to 2 inches, with an isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside a rapid flood risk, Rosa’s rain is likely a blessing because the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial because the southwest is currently experiencing dryness.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, only more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme dryness, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, Orkan Rosa’s road leads to the approach of land across Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at orcan strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific, so her power decreases.
So it is expected that she will reach the country on Monday in the afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"The rainfall counts from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday in the early morning hours and will then move through Arizona and to southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected by Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US Southwest," said the National Orchestra Centre.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening rapid floods and ruin streams in the deserts and soil displacements in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempts to kill
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempts to murder after a 16-year-old with a stick injury was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4 p.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" state.
An 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers appealed to anyone who might have any mobile image material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'had suffered under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the graceless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the commonness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and denied an emotional and fierce claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a jurisdiction with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican arrival at the medium-term selections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "consist and obstacle."
The first important procedure on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with figures that continue to rise
At least 384 people were dead and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach for a festival on the beach when burners broke up to six meters (18 feet) high at the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed all that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 scope of earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia's disaster illumination agency GDPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, stumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evakuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that were distorted and crashed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershots still shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesian agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shaking was about 200 times the force of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels crashed.
Bodys of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that crashed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the accidents and damage can be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Donggala closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely inhibited with no information" of Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they had not told that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur image material shared on social media, a man at the top floor of a building can be heard screaming desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and swallows buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send truck aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, stated authorities, but evacuators still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although the World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers in deck shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they crossed scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even while assistive groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief station, some complained that foreign support workers with many experiences were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can only be started after the area of the disaster has been declared to national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provinceal level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "All right, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it has not yet a status."
When the second night arrives at Palu to Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a rioler pipe.
Sunday, rescue workers had saved a woman for two days under ruin had been tightened with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national fallscreen team, set up two of the missing fallscreen waves for the Asian games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the fallscreen soil I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media under the fallscreen wave community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach feast.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 in refilling of OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26.750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Live, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was running to clear an OTM in a entertainment complex and ready to deliver more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man "run off behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects flying from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the intestine.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Canyes West: Rapper change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had for some time the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will proclaim his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of its current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'y'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with the radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has already finished with or without a coupling character and uppercase.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican newly chosen president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised to never use military power against civilians until the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968 on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were dead in a time when left-minded student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities move youth to gangs.
U.S. needs to double AI funding
With China that becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount it spends on research in this field, investor and KI practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made announcements of AI, even shortly the US has made a complete formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China announced their plan: they aim to be the number 1 in CI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next break in KI," said Lee.
The double of funding may double the chances that the next large CI performance will be achieved in the United States, Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that knocked the highest approved American Othello player and later he was an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognised previous technical competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government chairs, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate,' said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential persons from other universities to work at KI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. KI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD's in KI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at entering partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Chair Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came months later under fire.
Macedonian vote in choice or country name to change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", actions that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece which blocked its memberships for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who has a province named Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a requirement in the field and refused their permission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and a boikot campaign has seen doubts about whether the arrival will meet the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter reads: "If you are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including First Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price that could be paid to pursue authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the crash of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraphrase of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name will require a second-degradation in Parliament.
The state’s election commission said there were no reports of spaces at 1 p.m.
But the arrival was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring out their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name which will ban the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small hockey and drawn chairs before tents set up by those who go to the referendum boikot.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join up with our heads, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
First Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he delivered his voice.
He said a "yes" outcome would be " confirmation of our future".
A survey published by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than the required quantity.
Another survey performed by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, arrival must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious relapse for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigated by entire Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentinian target head received a given at the middle field.
He went through between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed by one defense before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target hok.
Then he pushed a gentleman to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English predictor used his first contact in the cage to send back the ball for Aguero, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton targeter Mathew Ryan with a spark to the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy he's signed a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premierliga contest.
The purpose came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the main target.
The Sky Blues’ predictor shot the ball into the net just before he was over the backline.
City takel Hopffenheim in Campioenliga Tuesday at 12:55 nm. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play better against Rockies.
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there is no much reason to force another start.
But the always competing Scherzer wants to adopt the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, who have a single race-prescursion above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least achieved a pro-motor choice with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to fix their first division title.
"Though we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year will stare in the face.
Why would I never want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their initial player for Sunday, but it is reported to be favorable to put Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a Thursday cast-training session and will play on his normal rest-sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outhalings in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his High Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican arrival at the medium - term choices.
"All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "a man sees this awful, terrible radical group of democracies, a man sees it happen now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, seeing the commonness, the genius.
They don't care for whom they hurt, for whom they should go to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and power, we will not give it to them."
Democracies, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstacle."
"And a man sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "awful and common and narrow and false."
He referred to the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - placed Dianne Feinstein, who had received hardly bound from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Have you made the document leak?
Uh, uh, what.
No, eh no, I wait one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Worker party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerable to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censur, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string Labour Party LP's who was told we were not welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she resisted fearlessly against anti-semitism.
In my case, the movement of censur criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed from former leaders.
The Notification for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what was Friday’s AR meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendlyer, more favourable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Worker Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a U-suit and to take positions that I would never otherwise agree – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and that doesn’t really matter what I say — there is a tirade of scary speech on social media that asks me not to be reselected, disapproving politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Worker Party.
And it is not just my experience.
Actually, I am more happy than my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who each day face a flood of sexist or racist insults but never screwe away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes tighter.
I have had a lot of advice in the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I will then be "oakie".
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it, whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hide my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been anywhat confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the movement on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends on a Brexit that damages all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Worker Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of being reelected or political benefit will prevent me from doing what I believe in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unoverwoond Ayr bo
Two late three might have taken the final outcome a little off, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderful-having tendent's Premiership-weddenship of the day.
They are now at the top of the pointleer, the only unconquered team of the ten.
Finally, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who wore the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be content.
"To date we have been tested in our matches and we are still inconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ear to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow map for Scotland player Rory Hughes, which was made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot signed an indefinite three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's forespring with a penalty head just before he intended a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, meant by Baggot, reduced the backward to five points.
There was a long retirement for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott which was carried on a portable, and from the restart, Ayr enlarged the precipitation with a Stafford McDowall-three, meant by Climo.
Ayr's observing captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed for Climo without the ball, and from the prison line, MacPherson pushed the ball dead behind the coming Ayr-losmal.
Climo meant it, he also did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong had got his target head and sent away flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star seems to take up a new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game-star will move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he is designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedive Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the final program, and Kiernan seems to prepare for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player did not want to comment, although a source suggested at the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': land-omringed Bolivia hope will open right away to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol a maze-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are plagued with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country - surrounded Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still fresh – nest the need to march the Pacific again.
That hope is likely the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of trackadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial fight for reselection – also has many that depend on Monday’s judgment.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analytics believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia’s favor will decide – and that little would change if it would.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and pointed out that it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's judgment comes only six months after the last approach shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down over the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was caught by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric cracked any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue conversations again at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have nadeous conversations.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in Den Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and an opportunity to "take an end to 139 years of differences with recursive benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that morals – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – use the maritime question as a political crucifix.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless they can trust the U.S.A.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri was on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to comply with the promises made at a conference in Singapore between the leaders of the contesting countries.
His comments follow to U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo apparently are on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "throom image" that continued sanctions and US caption will bring to an explanation that ended the Korean war will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the statement without taking significant steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing a arsenal that the country considers as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump Council.
Paris fashion shows the latest series of large head covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don’t have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have announced a series of overwhelming head covers at their SS19 collection on the runboard that enthusiastized the style of Paris Modeweek.
Extremely inpractical hats passed this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their astonishing creations on the runplank.
The excellent by Valentino was a overwhelming beige hat with a featherlike wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other overwhelming additions included water lemons decorated with jewels, a magic hat, and even a pain apple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also published a series of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had concealed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a shake equipment, including a snorkel and a dipglass, while another looked like a melted cream icehorinky.
And by continuing the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers foretell that the huge hats may be on the way to the stores near you.
The overwhelming hats follow shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely inpractical hat that was distributed about socially, sent another great creation on the runplank – a straw-strand bag that was almost as large as the swimming trousers that weared it.
The burned orange raffia sack, finished with raffia fractions and finished a white leather handle at the top, ended at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in stores for the next summer – since the designer made such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overwhelming additional.'
John Edward: Language Skills Vital for World Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a rite achievements of academic superiority, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exams, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music, and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schoolers across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolers and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schoolmates for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school course, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable professional choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the ligatables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolers who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, gathered from SCIS 74 grade schools, showed that 72 percent of students had a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that no doubt will be needed for children and young adults in the future.
Languages now have the same prestige as the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school currikula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Vocational Training and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons for their difficulties in filling posts are attributed to a deficiency of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely job opportunities demanding languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such lifelong skills.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-number percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important now to invest in today’s children’s language instruction.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff that are specialists in this field.
Scotland independent schools have been dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equipped with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages must really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
I'll get the bees fair.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers.
The guard is almost over for followers to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's pre-seasonal opening game.
But exactly how many minutes he is going to play still needs to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell had a bet that James probably will play a limited amount of time.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the pre-season program.
"I don't need to get ready at this stage in my career for seasonal matches," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Convention Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first out of five scheduled assemblies in the next week, including stops at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice currently held back for his choice to fill the vacatures in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming interference because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
How late was Trump's collaboration in West Virginia this evening and how do you look online?
Trump's assembly in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below through live flow to Trump's collaboration in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the named Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about accusations of sexual misbehavior with an expected confirmation voice that was held back for up to a week while the FBI investigated.
However, the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans faced with difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five collaborations in the next week were aimed at "to visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management of the Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, to Reuters.
Tonight's assembly, arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, supporters can move from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virgin Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president should come to give him a hup at the vocal bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Championship 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this rider cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is a totally degraded sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and definitely in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They walked forward with six points and now it is four, so we wear it as a little momentum, I count," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and twelve more to play.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not at least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played all day together, and each three points of four.
Spieth was deadly from the base to the shore and guided by his example.
That scared circuit of celebrations became harder as she progressed and he sank a critical setthour to win the match four completely equally as he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
His set that won the match on 15 for them was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that says to a man that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really have to pull out everything and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That is all that those players have left.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unambiguous story of the Ryder Beker.
Europe’s unmarried but charming couple have found four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not sign up one on the track number Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one track on the number of jobs at Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That loop, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exhausted crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can sound a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National sack.
Preferred both at the same time or at different sources.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short metals with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when playing with Alex Noren.
One holds over the number of tracks and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Sweden had landed in a hole they couldn't even get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and four-game teams are so excited to watch from near because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change into an eye.
Europe has to date always played better than a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-play session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 in front of the last day of the Ryder cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder cup, after they have come with a fortnight of 10-6 from Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to preserve the trophys that had lost them two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team who performed unequally in the morning’s fourballs, so that they had won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not reduce the deficiency.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to preserve the trophys.
Fleetwood is the first European newer who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called after a sensational weekend "Moliwood", are only the second pair in the history of the Ryderbeker who posted four points after their first four matches.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into the four balls, they played excellently together to conquer a pap Woods and American newman Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness, but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - which is the first and third on the world order.
However, on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a great tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-cup has a team recovered a backstand of four points when they enter the single game, even though Furik's team needs to play just equally to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After being the second best for two days, however, they do not seem to be able to get a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll definitely disarmament without confidence.
North Korean foreign minister said Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions would worsen their mistrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body's Annual General Assembly that in the last year North Korea has taken "a significant welwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear testing area and promised not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We, however, see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance against a "phased" approach to removing nuclear weapons that will be rewarded by taking progressive steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not unconditionally reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first top council between a president of the U.S.A. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim committed to work for "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised warranties for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war,' said Ri.
"The expression that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second top conference between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had pointed attention to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed attention to three meetings in the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue was about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramaticly different from last year, when he said to the UN's General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would be directed on the US country mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "fireman" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "altogether," Kim abundantly commended for his courage for taking steps to disarmament, but he said that much work should still be done and that sanctions must remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council that "Accordation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without stop until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to remove funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of setting "bandlike demands".
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to break down a missile area and also take a nuclear complex as the United States "conforming measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "conforming measures" he wanted to see security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course about enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year lets all its pregraduate students get more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing macho culture of study by combating coffee-driven 'healing sessions'.
A academic found that students at the world’s top university are often unaware of the basic principles of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep absorption on learning.
At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--what surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, offered that year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously taken sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students on coffee cups, gardins, exercise shoes and books have to click to be told about the effects of coffee and light and how athlete performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleeping risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routines.
'We know it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health impact is of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to 'study in whole' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep absorption is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 's secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it to put on weight, because sleep absorption puts the brain in a starving mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course last year, during his first year at Harvard, one of his classes.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before they join the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider to set an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' radiated by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circadical rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga Defeated Gerrard’s Men
Rangers experienced another arsenal of day-to-day heartache when Dolly Menga's target scope got Steven Gerrard's uncommon team a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1-sets at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had only given Gerrard his second defeat in 18 races as manager so his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had passed loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga took seven minutes before rest, and it seemed not that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further difficulties for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was evidently thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr to the end struggle of the Bethfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nups with the way his well trained team knocked their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball occupied, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, they must have recorded points after just two minutes when Menga’s first detention sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle field player opened his great chance.
A depth freescope by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only miss shot at the backer stake.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to have a punishment target at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless botsed, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a tough target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been in the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is just for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a nearly immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett who had palmed in long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have enlarged their advances in the last stages, but McGregor was well standing up to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter far from the corner point.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a punishment head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanak: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WITH OUT ... the day the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to 'see' robbery cells.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Instinct learns immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method includes withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change in a laboratory
They can see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "We're results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast-, ovarian, lung- and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and to "learn" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
After his action on SNL, Kanye West started with a pro-tramp talk, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released during a Saturday night live in the studio after an outdated action in which he believed the U.S. president Donald Trump and said that he would prefer him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town and when he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they're, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent out, the image of West’s scare was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule for West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him behind the stage for what he had worn on his head.
"They boiled me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They bowled me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Will you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "supermantle, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment at least twice led an audience to the audience and members of the SNL roll distribution seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, with one person there who said to the publication: "The entire studio has become deadly silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the room chatter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who drew: "To one of the courageousest spirits: Thank you that you were in favour of the scare."
But chatting maid Karen Hunter bet that the West was just "who he was and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "kunst") which I believe accepts an ideology and proclaims what endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the room chatter on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being who was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Co-room chatter, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion, and of course wide musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

It is expected that the prosecutor will appear before the Belfast Landdrosshof.
The charge will be revised by the public charge service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his swordswing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones.
But the player, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys feel that they should be thorough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic maleness in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his master from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he felt "reasonally strong" about making work on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with maleness?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television is likely responsible for the growth in toxic maleness because of its extreme male characters.
He continued, "What was born in and what was taught?
What is taught on the TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they need to have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones successions and follow-ups when the series next summer ends, for he says he's ready with battlefields and horses.
From November Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy crowned fantasy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family landings in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred by sex, which represents a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officers at a conference in Yuntan Province said.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transfer by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has made GOP sensors leak up the data, condemn 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters expired on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawyers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultraright" experts and sites.
"Leuens, lies and still awful lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The selected information is said to include the home addresses and phone numbers for US-Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol hill during the Senate Panel's trial on the claims of sexual misbehavior against the appointed for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conserwative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the places was linked to Waters’ office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters’ staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were endangered due to this fraudulent and false claim - was at all not responsible for the exclusion of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked criticism online, including former Whitehuis Press Representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she has not the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics that he seemed to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who attempts to light waters in the interaction selection from the coasts, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large if it is true," he whited.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law application bodies of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for all that they do is devastating and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spy spotting
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this resurrection of the Johnny English action comedie spottery franchise - which then started with Johnny English in 2003 and had further struggles with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-small self-atire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
In any case, the obstinate Johnny English with his outpeulers and rubber face had his license to waste everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film hearings.
He is of course the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a little of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good cut of that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, who left chaos behind him, which Atkinson played at once in the narrowly forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval pantser garment and cut the screw sheets shortly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels relatively faint and strangely overnecessary, especially when the "severe" film trade marks such as 007 and Mission Imposable now itself uses comedie with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than on adults, and for me, Johnny English’ opposition is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent puppies in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious difficulties.
A cuber cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spys and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the disturbance of the agent in service--a sad little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a blow-up and besieged character, who already experiences a complete collapse of political impopulation: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is endangered, she should call on someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now in service as a teacher at some delicate institution, but that from the record of giving lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some funny jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commuter, a all-map-stick roll in which to expect too little of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are from wasting everything completely up in Her Majesty’s secret service again, and they come to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is encountered in the dangerous enthusiasm of the charismatic technology billion claiming to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of ridiculous eskapades: hired as servants they burn a French restaurant, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury hunt; and English releases pure anarchy when he trys to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and exhausted as it may be, the whole affair is quite a lot like children's TV.
Reasonably mediumly.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Work deny that it's a plan for Britain to work for a four-day week but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week - but for five days.
The party claims that corporate base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (CI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will be 'fixed' to the party's economic agenda and plans of setting the country in favour of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An older worker party source said to The Sunday Times: a policy review will be expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to re-balance the economy in favour of the workers as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Worker Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the entire Worker Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: 'A quarterly working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to weigh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' from service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire investment because a Labour Government can make 'deductions' on the basis of supposed infringements.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on direct companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in businesses in the private sector to workers, which can receive annual dividends from up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delay and raises the question whether the Office's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for republic sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, Have you done it?
He was firm, definitely, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamit," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett denied it zealously," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't confirm it.
It is 36 years old.
I see nothing new change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be the host of the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and has an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create consciousness for the real purpose of the opportunity to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an enlargement of the World poverty project, an international proclamation group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free card to the opportunity (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to create consciousness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a whit?
Since 2011, Worldburger says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion were already paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based company of investors and implementers that are committed to "helping children reach their full potential" and promises to give $35 million for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 twitters from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website asking "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard way--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists acting at this year’s occasion in New York, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "blockades" to prevent exports of Russian energy - Minister of Inland Affairs
"In case necessary" Washington can leave himself on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Inland affairs Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legal government - is a precaution to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as makers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to a officer, there are ways and means to handle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendants of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without winning, which viewed themselves as the "Voice of the Energy Consumer" in the United States.
He went further to compare Washington’s approach to the handling of Russia and Iran and noticed that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single talent" with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come because Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a rise to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including the American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unfair" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin's Moscow 'container'.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to cube 110 billion meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin reasons that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is driven simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their providers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. opinion triggered opposition from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" standing as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would "take serious consideration" to stand as president after the medium-term selections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said, "The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously consider standing for president."
Warren reaffirmed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my inside about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very profound in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI investigation before our voice."
A Thursday survey showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight and fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey.
Twenty-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to stand possible in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining him in September.
He was arrested Monday evening and accused of an incident of household violence.
"What my own son is going through, which he has passed since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she said to a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and every other member of the army have given for the country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of household violence and possession of a gun while he was under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenges of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims flying from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-right order in Washington Friday to support an asylum seeker and to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimer in the Grace v. Sessions dispute submitted by the American Civil Libertic Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She tells her mate "and his violent gang boys," she abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
The State Prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of American applicants, as nations facing deep problems with gangs and household violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) allowing immigrants to apply asylum without the necessary documents that had escaped from domestic violence.
District Columbia's lawyer General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international laws of decades."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be decisive on the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such law infringement that policy," said the friend-of-the-right order.
Advocates further in the judicial order argued that the policy that immigrants refused access has damaged the US economy and said it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "required work."
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer allow asylum to victims fleeing because of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in its announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asiel was never meant to light all problems — even not all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Hopeless rescue efforts in Palu while death count doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly narrow.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her fevery baby son at a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants have been seen where they return to their devastated homes, searching for perplexed possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7,5 - range shaking, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershots.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed into the walls' ruins, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'awning' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper has published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that praises the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador for China Beijing accused that the American press was used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the US conventions of 6 November, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing trys to interfere with the US selections, marked what US officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds equal to each other’s imports.
China’s refund rates early in the trade war aimed to beat exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US scholars.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now worriing the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government grew America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited deviations in voices and not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic field, giving that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China’s most prominent newspapers was scared away from the offer of publishing his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republics are alienating women's choosers from interactions with Kavanaugh debakel, warning analyticals
While many top-republics stand at the Supreme Court-generated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analyticals warned that they would see counterreaction during the coming interactions, especially of women.
The emotions about this are enormously high, and most Republicans are recorded that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor in political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s urge for a FBI investigation on the narrow enough to apologize violent choosers.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, said, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on the way!" yelling as they argued at the Senate's portal of entry, while the Republicans who chose the Judge Committee to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analytical, to the news site.
"Men say it was already high; it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger votes, 18- to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that describes the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-generated, analyticals said that if Republicans continue to confirm a reaction could follow.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and Kavanaugh's being put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choose democracies, sent to the news channel.
But Americans seem a little divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, with a little more choosing the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s witness, while 35 say that they definitely or likely believe in Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was likely or definitively shocking during his witnesses, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s urge, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week under oath before the Senate's Judgment Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at 17 years of age while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated his sexual parts to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, starts a start job trying to deal with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legendary's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the idea with Inrupt is "world surveillance".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is fully based on the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it personal authorization by data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralised applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the presentation of a complete change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a place on Media published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee had an influenceful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honoured 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann acquired the award in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brillant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, Vann on September 29, 1918 led his bataljon over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through a lot of dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest braveness" before he stormed man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the section.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German sharp shooter – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never admit, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orkes.
Michael Vann said he "feeling honoured to be able to play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night watching the follow-up Bellator 206, just to not be able to see the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be sent directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on the way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the United Kingdom were stumbled when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unexpressed after staying awake for the battle to the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the conversion to the child's cartoon as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice-president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they'll work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of the re-emission, I think we can probably find out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there, and we will not be able to send it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many texts that were sent over and over and it was not all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our followers and just cross our time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had a 'minder' feeling about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up with a minority feeling about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had less cared about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years - long program, Kirsty Young, had taken a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he disappointed no one when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's state alliance games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He says he shook his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hopping".
The three - time world champion said that to get in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “had caught him away.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you suffered so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar heights and lowest points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she's changed "the whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a golden medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic golden medals.
My Olympic golden medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he died and one of the last goods he asked was whether they had all tickets for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
'I couldn't say to him,' you're not going to be here to be in the front row,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not inconquering," he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about for my life -- to dip before my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – who also resonated with him in building up to the Olympic Games and still giving him chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and withdraws from Saturday's riding cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th rider-cup game, but he will have to get his form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays a record-12th time in the two-yearly event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-folds.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold Major winner will divide his day in the meantime to be racist leader and work on the exercise bow at his game in the hope of fixing what disputes.
Even at the climax of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old wasn't the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National path where the long rural field always punishes the misleading holds.
And as if the job on its own was not challenging enough, Mickelson was on Sunday in his ninth match against the exact British Ope Champion Francesco Molinari, who had collaborated with new man Tommy Fleetwood to win all their four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s competition can be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much different.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a knock on the back and sat his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He had much confidence in himself.
He is in the heroic hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine that he would play two games.
I had more prospects, but this is how things worked out and what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will override Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Ryder Beker Games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a rider circuit course that has never really matched the peaks of its individual performance.
Mickelson had 18 victories, 20 settlements, and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence had contributed to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, like shattering the crazy, and he's a wonderful old to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed sharing crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows a great front jump can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows out of experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Rydercup can easily turn into a discomfortful experience.
The Deen made its debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point step, but only won nail scrap with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A man continues to remind yourself that we had a great precipitation at Valderrama; we had a great precipitation at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scrap," said Bjorn, on the photo, after he had watched the class of 2018 won 5-3 Friday and yesterday was 10-6 before at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I'm still saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Happy about how his players went on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with it.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes to the turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that you need to communicate to players, the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your spouse behind, and he must also put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his companion Jim Furyk will want his players to go better individually than they did as players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furyk himself had been turned on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every dipthing word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke his players courage on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it places a lot of stress on that middle race.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us something magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counter attack and faced the main race against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Delayed Again
The newest fregate of the German army would have been put in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to defective systems and growing costs, report local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splintern-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Time newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This ship must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the distressing post-supply issues harassed this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class of vessels ordering the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class fregates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a stroke of air defence and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest fregates for up to two years away from homes.
But continuous delays mean that the advanced warships — which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas — will already become obsolete at the time they are serving, calls The Time.
The disastrous F125 fregate made records last year when the German Navy officially refused to service the ship and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipping lot in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to deliverion to a shipbuilder.
Few are known for the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is being deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – just half of the male power on older Bremen class fregates.
It also revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, which reduces the performance of the work and reduces the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are presumed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price label for the entire project — including the training of the crew — also affected a question.
It apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have beaten the new fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the force of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be exploded are on the move."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He mourned that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Flea’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a landscape in the Scotland Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the ordinary and sopran wring bat and the brown long-over and Daubenton bats at Invervede Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track fladder mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings by using hand indicators.
Expert clan channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the fladder mouse calls and determine which species to do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of the habitat for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and the best way to manage forest countries for bats and other associated species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased considerably during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flag mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to show goggas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings and sleeping place inspections and sometimes carry out salvation.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave landings in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Agriculture manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very veterinary trees and all the good habitats.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work that we do here and on other property helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the need to seek for bats before maintenance in property is done because it is possible that unaware destruction of a single breeding place can mean 400 females and young ones’ death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Flea mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them, or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump into help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their population is going."
Ronaldo cuts off rape assaults while lawyers prepare for German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo killed rape assaults against him as "false news" and said that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to approve the German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus precautionary was accused of raped a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He claimed to have paid her $375,000 to stay silent about the intact, reports Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he speaks to his 142 million followers, hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, declared the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-fold balloon d'Or-winning to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyer is ready to approve Der Spiegel on the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "inappropriate reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "moral damage compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed intent was reported in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to go to the player’s room, where he was supposedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the claimed intact and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" that was left behind by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a statement outside the court because she was "bang for revenge" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the order now because she was still traumatized by the claimed intact.
Ronaldo was about to join from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the claimed assault and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'forever repentant' if their car manufacturers lose.
The UK 'will repent forever' if they lost their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK said to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would have to stop temporary production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-conform-Brexit, could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which produced Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
For example, BMW said that they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say is road chain risks in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but for us to take this event," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue what was an extremely successful set of lead chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that additional costs could reduce the construction’s competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's collector on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Whitehuis.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein "can be postponed with another week" while the fighting on nominated for the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the Whitehouse said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special judicial advisor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible violation of the right by the President.
Whether the Advocate General is going to leave or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, Trump has been driving Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choos not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deferred to avoid a conflict with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date before it has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things that go on with the Supreme Court.
But we shall see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders have not yet held a Whitehouse press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarceness of information sessions is not due to a contradiction for TV journalists who are "efficiency hunting," although she said, "I won't fight with the fact that they are effectively hunted."
She then indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this very much, and you've seen us do it very much in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity clarifiers.
Solo press declarations are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbonded and sometimes bizarre appearance before journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health write to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fear
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff who worked in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the desire to stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrawn from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also reinforced their preparations for a possible non-conform scenario.
I know it is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate each member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and further, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and kind of just dropped down there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theatre at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee States after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he killed five times before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season on 18 death vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to move young choosers.
The seal tax will be lifted on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Thessoury expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom – with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to move young choosers with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be lifted on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The by - tax — which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to rent — can be up to three percent.
The Thessoury expects that this move can bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London property is bought by non-UK citizens who raise the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the house door.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spook villages ” because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs May to take off quotas on affordable houses to restore Britain's "residential disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of suggested housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no-failure exclusions".
He also wants to give advice to greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “I said last year I would devote my presidency to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it can not be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British inhabitants.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become a despised dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become a too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to run Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some time.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is currently in the third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the stadium of Light after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Ministership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but that was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and this is something that draws me back.
However, the occasion can only come if I'm successful with club transmission."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa athletic boss said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a great club, after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"On the moment, success will be measured for me by ''I can make this club return to the Premier-liga?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier-liga," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably see myself as successful only if I can get the club out again."
Ross' career in the management is for just three years, after a period as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' trainee staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and convert St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship Title in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his play course at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroad," he said when he thought back about how he took over Alloa's leads.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did good enough, made a reasonable existence of it, and experienced reasonable peaks.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come through every week.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the complete interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pin is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording.
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but the receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of Business Consultation Company CGA, who compiled the numbers, says: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking places were on with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drankie-led drinking places and bars have done far better and increased more than restaurants have dropped.
Food-based drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Throughout driven cages and drinking places sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food was off by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: "This results continue the tendency that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sport events remain the biggest factors in sales in the out-the-home-out market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent years a year would be particularly difficult above and other than constant expenses.
The long warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the desire in trade proclamations.

One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta-pages"
The news raised fears that sexual content was placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years – creates social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school teachers revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo substitute Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexual content was placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmeisters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of those acknowledging that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are in the temptation to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "vote for athletes" at Scottish athlete's board.
Eilidh Doyle was preferred to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the management body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job-and-field athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athlete community and we are sure sports in Scotland will benefit very much from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes, and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympics, is now a regular BBC expert, could walk after he had a short-term ischemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would learn whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhaustive work, but fully recovered, learned to walk again, and practices fitness practices today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Brust pads that compare moms to cows divided opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To celebrate the leads of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," the consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers that milk out.
Four right mothers dance in a shed full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
The core section says: "Push it out, pump it out, I carry out the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many who say that it underplays the "gruves" of the dairy industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We must become pregnant and give birth to milk, but their babies are often stolen of them within days of their birth," wrote one.

Another remarked: "It is understandable that there are traumatical effects for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertising is so out of sense."
Others defended the ad, with one woman acknowledging that the song for her was "crying naked."
"I think it's a genial idea.
I would have had one if I had still breastfeed.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another one said, "It's a nice advertising aimed at mothers who feel melting (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It is not a advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is deadly silent, has no wires or pipes, and is just discreet in a nutrition brass that gives women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD of Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a great and exciting release.
By dragging a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the light, while in a entertaining way that people can connect to show the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the runboard for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrant children has increased sharply, although monthly border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fel rhetoric and policies established by the Trump administration which make it harder to place children at cash.
Traditionally, most guarantees were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was endangered by stepping forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible cash and other adult members of their households should go their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at immigration and customs enforcement before the Congress, witnessed that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied for the payment of unmarried minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Most 80 percent of the individuals who are either cash or household members of cash, are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which were the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than in person, to appeal to their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in arrest, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape efforts, according to refugee workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates say that the concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child's problems are more easily mislooked due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally to say good - bye to friends, can worsen the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish occupational forces to withdraw immediately.
When he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as adjunct-first minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "conformly handled".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions disordered, is "atmosphere over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry this sacred battle until we cleaned all Syrian areas" from both terror groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly opposed Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - inflicted country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were okay for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organisations to fasilize these returners," he said.
"They politics something that should be merely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas have stated a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel fortification of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement defended a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "precise sperms" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front that will be "exterminated".
UN Sent, Staffan de Mistura hopes to bring together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and to ban the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "examination of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reselection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals will end his presidentship early.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic final of a Presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of sighting tiredness.
Since 2014, CCN has doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million top time watchers, of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" are top cable watching numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on large news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people were attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroy the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a few hard truths about Snowing In the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 choice.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, she asked.
"He said, "Because he let me laugh," said Scovell to me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
To disable is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of being watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Strasbour-leather bay ("a piece of clothing thick of the hybris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program, is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, business head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily kincles in the plot (like to seek dispute with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to commend).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking at MSNBC inside while he took CNN.
He couldn’t break him apart, not with Brett Kavanaugh on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outdoor money flows to the most exciting medium-term selection races in House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a flow of money, thanks to a shift from conventional districts that have now brought two officials into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburb Pittsburg district makes Democracy Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure powers.
Lamb stands against another official carrier, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is heavyly overwhelmed with the new 17th.
The cards were recalled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally definitely in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th was shot off with a campaign funding competition between the large parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Veldtog Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Fields Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania to win a nail scrap in a wide-looked special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the democratics a slightly advantage.
The U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then returning
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until companions disfellowshipped the Trump Organization’s management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to call back the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in an explanation.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug management, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reducing financial assistance and enforced visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year which was considered a step forward in a attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top-administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to put an end effectively to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Advocate Mike Pence is now decreed to speak to the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomates said.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new violent messages or hardships from Washington.
A Whitehouse spokesman for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomates, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analytical who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen may be the special discussion about Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible terror of the court, whose evidence is now very significant in the public record.
Mr. Mueller suspectedly also focuses his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
Would the Congress go over in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just when he was prepared to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of asses, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his companions in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a state grip against Hitler, if the West had just opposed him and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the burial of the years that followed.
The course of history turns around such turnpoints and democracy’s covetous course is speeded up or slowed down.
Americans now face several such turnpoints.
What will we do if Mr. Trump, Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to take the president in secret and speculated whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How would we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a conference that will hold responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that at a time lived in my ambassadors' house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to turn on Sabbath-chers on that table wearing the swastic.
With this when I come back, how can't I be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistics for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will put in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe Liga.
A knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equipment equation against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this outcome as a way away for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a count of equals is probably a righteous result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can persist and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor on the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now persist, last season sitting behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement money fear
Despite the fact that recorders have a clear idea of how they want to be cared, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they talk to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"Men want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
Here is true to begin.
Talk to your husband and the children: If you do not express your wishes long before the time, you cannot prepare your family for care.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Invite your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Compile your legal documents: Cut off legal struggles at the pace.
Get a health care staff instead so that you instruct a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the legal authority for you financially.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are inappropriate.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you are ready.
"It's not just the financial matters that are about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is placed."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death count is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala government, a area north of Palu close to the center of the 7.5 range of shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to security after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainy that extends over 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwestern Sulawesi island.
The government, a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the support pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the big earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A large shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakings hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 range of shaking took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 range of shaking hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya government in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shake and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Large shaking hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily struck.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested on charges of household violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of household violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of household violence and opposition against arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a female knowledge phone with her when she called the police to register the claimed crimes.
Palin is arrested at Mat-Su Interrogation Facility and is held on a $500 unsecurated cash, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, definitely" when asked what he pleaded, the network reported.
Palin stares three class A infringements in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and $250,000 be paid.
He is also accused of a class B infringement, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints were made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the claimed attack.
The case is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of household violence, interference with the report of a crime of household violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 scope of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks were excluded with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that point the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City Terror attack that caused eight people’s death – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, claimed to have used a Home Depot truck to attack a bike path along the West Side Railway in Lower Manhattan to reap footgängers and a bicycler who was in his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has deliberately killed the eight victims and has committed "deliberately" serious physical injuries, according to the notification of the intention to ask for the death penalty, submitted to the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both those accusations may carry death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury of Saipov struck 22 accusations, including eight accusations of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and predecession", said the prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "absurd, cruel, and pervers."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since then, the Southern District of New York has legally persecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after they were sentenced for a complot to perform spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were degraded with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he did, said the police.
Saipov said to the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after he had watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He innocently pleaded on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accepting a debt recognition to life prison penalty with no possible release will only extend the trauma of these events to all the stakeholders." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL CARAGE should be placed in the management of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize today "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" from Euroshippers – as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone said to the March in Birmingham that by the time the UK would "be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces is to unite her deeply divided officers by pro-Romein Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Alliances insisted that she would press through in her attempt to make an agreement with Brussels despite the death process – and force Euroshippers and Work to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Run meaning Run-Congress in Solihull that he wanted to "shoot out Chequers."
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a noble man and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to eject Chequers.'
He explained his opposition against the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own land."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to remain is completely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the March and said to reporters: ‘ I simply say: First Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unwelcome with the general public, the opposition is not to vote for it, it is unwelcome with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are first chosen.
Let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farbe told the convention politicians that if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they had to feel the "hitte".
'It is now about a case of confidence between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regarding, proud United Kingdom.'
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in the city center.
A few activists winked Tories against Brexit bananas at the release of the group this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
‘It are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the wreckless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
‘That’s a total cleverness.
There's no thing like a good Brexit,' he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sounds world title after team commands gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the tours.
From the stake position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Bolt to attack his teammate.
First, fat went into the wells and left Hamilton to drive in the whole back of the bond of traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes got a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver seen abandoned risk-free the inside at risk of endurance after a double movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstap began from the back row from the gap and was seventh at the end of the first round on its 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the trips as he held on his tires to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He may have arrived at the 44th round at the wells, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkon had taken the fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valteri did fantasticly all weekends and was “a true gentleman. ”
The team had done extraordinary work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It had been fairly bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked at a convention on Saturday Senator Dianne Feinstein about her insistence that she had not licked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-owned Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and common and liars," he said.
"When you look at explanations and lectures and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in an event of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that in July explained the accusations against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the lecture had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I did not lick her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidentially as she asked."
But the president did not think her denial was good and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I tell you what. It was fairly bad body language.
She may not have, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court-genominated, accused by three women of sexual misbehavior, and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means of power.
You see the commonness, the unrighteousness, they don't care about who they hurt, who they need to crush to get power and control," reported Mediaite the president.

Air traffic manager dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquakes
A air traffic manager in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had lifted safely.
More than 800 people died and more are missing after a large earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong deteriorations in the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that had swung very hard on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained inevitable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which at that time was on the runway, was able to increase safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he threw together the day.
Later he died in the hospital.
Prosecutor for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death rate can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster soothing agency, which says that access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"There is believed that the death rate still increases since many bodies are still under the construction cases while many cannot yet be achieved," said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Flows reaching up to six meters robbed Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and stock.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Each minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minor markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chases to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military service: "I all of you ask to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says if one man is missing after the beach of fly accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had said before that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evakuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in an explanation that since Saturday afternoon they have not been able to account for a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had arrived very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium - depth water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airguards had paniced and screamed, and he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures working close to improving a key also helped with a respirable boat with salvation to get people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in collapse of PNG registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analists set timeline out of the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the hearing of a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intellectual analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile records to assemble the movements of 29-year-oldly accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was Chambers together the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that she was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's train that night, Sanford said, "jok, because my train was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information was deleted from his phone.
"He surely made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was planned to begin his final pleading Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurrection in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY-children's maid marrying a couple because she's dismissed to "racist" text.
A New York-children's wife succumbs a couple for discrimination after she received a wrongly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case to "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was excited when she learned that Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEWEEEEEEEE NOW A SWART PERSOON," wrote Ms Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me, Maurice.
After she discovered her error, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that their outgoing child-girl who was African-American did bad work and that she rather expected a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice appoints the couple for damage compensation for the disbursement and seeks his damage compensation for the amount of $350 a day for the six months, inhabitant work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do so good," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claims that they were racist and said that it was reasonable to stop Maurice’s insistence and fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," a man told Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it had been wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Now."
Plasco compared the case with "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby over two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the trial continued, the Court of Public Opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and knock them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a speaking bear would not link readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fierce if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC camera man before he was inspired to write the child book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death was "bitter sweet".
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't an apple man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success like that.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to greet over the phone
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect she would make it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heartbeat.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart on knocking were slowly touching up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit down there waiting, knowing that it was being unfolded.
I could not shout or cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane along with the other passengers - unconscious of the trial she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had fallen my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had cleared any room."
But he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out to whom you can go and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you must talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It's breaking a hole through the family.
It distinguishes us.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still undecisive as the FBI starts to investigate
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless inquiry that didn't cover - could we perhaps bring a little unit," said Mr Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "at fall apart" under embroidered partial accumulation.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition is all because of time calculation.
The interactions are only weeks away, on November 6, - if, as expected, the Republicans suffer badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have chosen to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivered his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the Vice-President, will allow to break an equal game and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean surpassing numbers 'dal' under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, said a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-sugh quoted data from the South Unification Cabinet and said that there were 1,127 surpasses last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs asked by human smugglers have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The large majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China considers the skippers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically speaking in war with one another, have been markedly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that focused on the strange negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed on Saturday US penalties for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarmament ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a talk to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," he says he is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Home Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-owned Board Kavanaugh "histeries" and said he was temperately inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted so, they would say 'histeries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Legal Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times screamed and shouted as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also expressly rejected democratics on the committee and called the claims against him a "shameful and coordinated character cluster murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he had been against democratic prejudices.
"I think he makes himself inappropriate with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as democratics the majority in the Lower House won.
"I'll say that -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be in the court where he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ummegang Appèlhof.
Pelosi added that she was as a Democrat concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable care or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a histerical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' Pelosi said.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," I told Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said she was crying when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person she had spoken to, "you might think that I was sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for magic because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I cry with nameless anger and was caught at my neck skinne by an older woman--a cold manager for whom I was a little scared--who dragged me into a trapportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know that you are angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congress woman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the tours, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't run for President.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finding senses, so she vowed that she would not enter the trips unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get off?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for sexism - that she had stuck.
You would have thought I had a nervous crash," recalled me Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Cleenex was my corporate castle.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my grave stone?
"She cryed?"
How the U.S. Shina trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China had been overdoding and while the fight was over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long term beneficial to Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, had fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including sun panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most important escalation rolled in with new tariffs affecting $200 billion ($150 billion) items and effectively charged half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing took revenge every time and recently paid from five to ten percent to $60 billions of American goods.
Shina promised to equate the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to satisfy publicly the US's requests would be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure on US trade war on the long - term China can be positively supported by reducing the interdependency of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic 12 air in any of the countries, is actually far more dangerous than what audiences had confessed before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land destroyed by war for more than seven years.
The Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions improve in the country.
"Today the situation on the ground level is more stable and safe due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need filantropical assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder-Beker victory in Paris
Team Europe won the rider-cup 2018 and conquered the US team with a final point of 16.5 at 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown back when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, had T-hou in the water at the pair-3 16th hole and admitted his competition to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari has blinked in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since then the tournament's current format started in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blowed out by the lowest player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight riders, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25,5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He uses the fakle over to his landlord John Ram who, on Sunday, conquered the US-golvent Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods had lost all his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3-run rider record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all times and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekends to find the shorefield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke for a disappointing performance on behalf of his team, "I am proud of these guys.
There had been this morning when we had put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Beker Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You must keep your hat shy.
We are superior."
