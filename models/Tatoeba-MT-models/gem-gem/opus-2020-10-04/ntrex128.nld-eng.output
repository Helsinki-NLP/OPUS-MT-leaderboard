Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
A proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament) is an excitement among the members of the National Assembly of Wales.
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name happens ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is “reaching on Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: twp is crazy for Welsh and pwp is Welsh for piep.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘unsatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently laying down legislation to implement the change of name, said: 'There are of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be baptized into Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP was most supported in public consultation.
At the moment, Members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a difficult time to reach a consensus, and it will have to submit a draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committees system.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to vote in final terms on their new title when discussing legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote at a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a suspending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbourhood means that the country would claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the referendum, has said that he will not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's hard to deal with
"The older people I spoke with said that there was a café and a church in the past on each corner," said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be detected here."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
“People now have a different way of social contact,” he said.
"Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people go regularly."
However, he is worried that the profits of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, "and early or late they will be back at the beginning."
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people that would not help in the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to the close of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that those who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were ever built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropool: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation in the vicinity took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the leadership of President John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shop street in Harlem, where black people could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building became seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishes of Mr Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
President David Johnson, the son of President Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard pride “the clocks of the poor”.
The expert who played the barbecue in July pointed another way to the instrument: 'an cultural treasure' and 'a unreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beard of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some hired by the league leaders of the church, others by the bishop.
The consistency (the governing body of the parliament, consisting of league leaders) wrote the bisdom in July to express its concern that the bisdom would “want to calculate the costs” to the constitutory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the bisdom.
Some parliaments complained about the lack of transparency of the bisdom.
Hay hurts 13-year-old who dodged to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who fell to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been around half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hamel said that first he thought the boy cried because he had caught a cavity, but then he realized “that the boy cried:“I have been bit!
I have been bit!"
His key leg was completely open," he saw Hammel when he approached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should go out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'."
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is supposed to be in danger of life.
It's not a conscience which kind of sharks are responsible for the attack.
Beach Guard Captain Larry Giles told at a press conference that a shark had been ridiculed nearby a few weeks earlier, but it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break in the British beauty market
Sainsbury's are in competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and set up beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in storehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the ranges of televisions, magnets and interior articles with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time branding such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bee also gets more space, with table per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up on the market again, since most of the products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers demand more and more.
In addition, parfume the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first was opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets have to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like supermarket houses, now the supermarket chain takes it up against discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's have integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have resulted in more profit.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apotheek a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but cooperation was ended when a conflict arised about the division of income from the pharmaceutical department into the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmaceutical departments in the shops three years ago for a amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, which will be ready to provide advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer for each one some will, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'wrathful' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'wrathful' because Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is raging at Holly Willoughby, because she has retired from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “wored” when Willoughby was on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that her new contracts (with a value of half a million pounds) did not hold enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of approximately 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his holiday homes in abroad.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priority.
It would ensure its future in the long term, and give enough for the next decades.
Everyone was bleeded when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatric, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from kiss and candles to clothing and homewear, and because launch could now rise further delays.
And that could mean the end of a years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40 per cent in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon be the M&S brand mazedor and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentation of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British Sender ITV.
One source from Jones' enthusiasm said last night: "We have no comment on his business matters."
Hard language 'and then love was between us'
He grudged about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment that he made that some people would find “unconscious for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a great step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see the United States’ ‘comparative’ response after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results, the missile tests have been completed, hostages have been freed, and the physical surpluses of American military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach with regard to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, some 200 people would stand here,” said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy a island, where hundreds of deaths fall
For example, in the follow-up of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had no home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
"In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international assistance, which is difficult for us," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the abroad providers can work on the site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Agency for National Disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for nature’s anger.
In Aceh hiding places were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see these.
The fact that there was no warning iron for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal circumstances, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the sealess infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the key points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent abundant money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has to face a shortage of funding, and that while he hopes to be reelected next year.
President Yoko is also under pressure by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the street, with machiets, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizer to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday from loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He ticked left to the ball and then sprang towards the main stake.
The ball flooded high above the criminal area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He uncovered the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and risking a attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked at the ball.”
Chelsea was at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The tip of The Blues kicked the ball with its heel to Mateo Kovacic, then accelerated through the middle field to Liverpool's playhole.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle field.
Afterward, he gave a beautiful sticky passport, allowing Hazard to reach the field of punishment.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back stake.
Liverpool plays Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes up on Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The death rate of tsunami in Indonesia is up to 832
The death rate of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, said the agency for assistance in national disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruin of buildings that had crashed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with waves also rising from 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is filled with ruined buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man on suspect of murder after woman has been stabbed.

The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard something.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just started, but I want everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard any suspicious requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact if they have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman on the place to ask questions about the place she was found this morning.
The investigation is running and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.

Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' roll
The ban on the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr Crick as 'dwaas' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visibility of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded, nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness to the opinion that ruled in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many say still needs to be recognized.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the defendant of the Parliament against external pressure, of course, in his case the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and remembered."
Killed pig killed Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a steel on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was surrounded and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig stalk, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was supposed to have travelled from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he found a door open to a neighboring pig stalk.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood on his mouth was found in the pig shock.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mumped,” said the cousin with the last name “Wu”, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The pictures of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 o'clock to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market responsible told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the place.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have already been cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, making the man seriously hurt.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kg pig from Wales pushed a farmer against his tractor until his wife poured the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News witnessed that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can cause aggression.
“They are just plays.
They're like kids, very curious, they're not going to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
The tail of the hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As foretold, the hurricane Rosa is weak when she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, bring heavy rain to northern Mexico and southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a local time on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to roll up to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form above the Pacific, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring 10 cm rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that responds with the approaching trog will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, ruin flows and possibly natural displacements in the desert.
tropical moisture will lead to downfall from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to go into the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall is threatened.
The heavy ravine ravine can surround in desolate rivers, and storms will produce local windflakes and dust.
The nearing trog brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small puin flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rain season.
Distributed tropical rain will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, then the rain will be spread more on Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the four corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the United States can swell strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and eastern US, October is expected to begin warm, with temperatures scaming around the 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees hotter than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance until mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the Eastern United States.
More than 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the US Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impass continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee of Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was inflicting her and tried to pull out her clothes during a party at high school.
Kavanaugh declared in a provoked witness that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably been watching on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at a office.
In comparison, that is about like for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar ride.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that demonstrations shouted at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing from the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with depressed eyes while he was blasphemed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here right before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and closed just before the lift, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters sinned all live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote in favour only with the sense that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated against the next week, which the democrats of the minority demand.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation for the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of a political game around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were criticizing their plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit, who said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should take each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Shooting party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the player of LSU
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge Police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later declared that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with death.
His warranty has been set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The bodyseeker of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, which states that the cause of death is a shot in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the Crime Lab of State Police, the Police of Southern University and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports Director Joe Allva of LSU thanked the local police for his "intention and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "captured" and "in shock" dead by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope it will never happen,” says Wade.
Vulcan sprays ashes on Mexico City
The axis sprayed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several crumbs and vibrations.
On social media photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on car routes in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake met with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Political conflict with Catalan separaters on the morning of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independent activists had succeeded in rebellion politics, while thousands of participants in rivalising demonstrations at the occasion of the first birthday of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which distinguished the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separators who were stopped by the rebellious police collated the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark vacuum clouds in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screen exchanges broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their bucket to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents ‘Long Life Spain’ cried out.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries that they had arisen during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent region, a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers to be illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters proclaimed themselves overwhelmingly to become independent, although the arrival was low and the people against divorce the vote boycotten.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year nearly 1,000 people were hurt after the police had tried to stop the vote in the voting agencies in the region, where it was a violent scenery.
Pro-independency groups had camped on site the night of Friday on Saturday in order to prevent a demonstration to support national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest along with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of independent Catalonia.
“We had one of our most beautiful moments last year.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was a necessity, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in their own exile or in captivity, waiting for a trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old assembly who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in preliminary prison since the end of last year, declared that he is participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was attacked by a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly attacked in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place Thursday at 7:30 a.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at a given time.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the objective of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston delivered them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference, and Gary Holt's team was equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not manage this season to win an excursion match during the Prime Ministership. They have to take up the Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston has not been hit. The team has won six contests in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't had any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses chances for strong visitors
The Holt team had long before the first goal to achieve a preliminary step, because their direct way of playing caused a variety of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who captured Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team made the Rangers play with pleasant pleasure and waited for his chances calmly and self-safe.
And that eventually led to the crucial objective.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston made a opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scared from the criminal area.
At that time, the Rangers had had a long time of balcony, but the defense of the home team was indispensable and the targetman Liam Kelly had not had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos ensured that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after his colleagues of Livingston had made it.
Continuously, Livingston's penalty area was proposed, but they were defeated every time. Two times a penaltyship was denied, one after Halkett's attack on invading Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed the expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swooped the team since his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes during the whole match.
But the Rangers did not know by breaking.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once to distort the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany joined breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at recovering relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cold is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they insisted on the crowd of 25,000 people to gather themselves for the Mosque, but many sympathetics came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and others are accused of as an autocrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies after car crash
In London, a bicycler died in a collision where a car was involved.
The accident occurred near the cross point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died at the place.
A few months ago, another bicycler died in an accident with flight crime at Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and inform his nearest family.
The road is closed in various places, buses are redirected and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six ciphers injured in order disorders
Six ciphers have been hurt in order disorders in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ ciphers have been used to resolve situations, including eight prisoners involved in one section.
The ciphers were treated places for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prisoner said: ‘Specially trained prison staff was used for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind the bars.'
In HMP Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebellion police was called to prison for a serious disorder in order to attack staff with billion balls.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of the orchestra Rosa moves over the southwest of the desert area, leading to risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday right above Phoenix. Monday evening it will already be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “sin 1950 only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles from the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm downfall, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably receive 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For the areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by dryness.
Although flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall will probably be favorable because the southwest is currently under dryness.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drying areas are listed, something more than 40 percent of Arizona spends at least extreme dryness, the second highest category,' weather.com reported.
The route of orcan Rosa reaches the continent via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on orchestra on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Heavy rain may fall into parts of Mexico, which leads to a significant risk of flooding.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border with Arizona in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then enter late Tuesday evening by Arizona and southern Utah.
“The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruins in the deserts and earth shifts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspect of attempts to murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspect of attempts to murder after a 16-year-old with stick injuries was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton at about 4 hours of local time.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, says the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered 'under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the unpleasant and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh was constantly suffering under the common, the anger of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh witnessed on Thursday to the Congress and denied strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford’s excitement that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her incidence during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the 'American people' saw the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to acknowledge Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is recognised, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican emergence at the interim elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our life will take place.
I don't take part, but I actually do, "he said.
"I am therefore going everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to 'combat resistance and obstacle us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top colleague of the GOP's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
At least 384 people were killed in a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where many were destroyed from the ground when giant waves crashed on the beach, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high landed at the time it began to plank. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
“When the tsunami threat arised yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Office for Natural Disasters BB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he drove cars, trees, houses, he touched everything on the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evakuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On air photos released by the Natural Disaster Assistance Office, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been distorted, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained trembling by shocking.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the force of the nuclear bomb falling on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had crashed.
Some deadly victims were stuck under the ruin of ruined buildings, he said. Some 540 people were hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “lights completely flat, we have no information at all,” said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in an explanation. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy now, but it can get much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared in social media, a man on the top floor of a building in panic screams down to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast, and buildings and cars are swollen.
Reuters couldn't verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami provided a major stream disturbance that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with aid goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodentol rises above 800.
It's very bad.
It is true that the World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the home of their office are looking for dwelling in tents of ceiling, but they passed scenes of destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began with the difficult task of launching the emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and staff from abroad can not be allowed until the location of a disaster is exclaimed as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been proclaimed.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu of Friday, friends and family of the missing were hoping to find their loved ones back to life, such as in the miracles that people like to hear from terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a rivalry.
On Sunday, helpers delivered a woman who had caught two days under the ruin with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax,” he said.
Mr Gendon told me that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread in the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival in the hours thereafter.
In his reports, however, only one grey pink appeared instead of two blue pinks.
“I think that means that the messages are not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 dollars during the supply of money automatic in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a staff member of Brink who was filling a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just cleared a money automation in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink’s staff and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspected flights, according to the press report, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Whoever has information about the identity of the criminals is asked to contact the Newport police at the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to propose his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just a shortening of his present artist name. Previously, West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye', said West earlier this year, when he told Big Boy about the title of his album.
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means "the only" to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, all.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who's changing his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, JAY-Z, who had previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the link sign and the uppercase letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the morning of the 50th anniversary of a bloody represal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, where up to 300 people were killed. In that period, left student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a shortage of opportunities for study.
United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this as a result of the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations.
“Doubling the research budget for A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.”, said Lee.
Duplicated funding may lead to a doubled chance of the next major achievement for A.I. in the United States, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the most important A.I. companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an A.I. system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to receive government subsidies, said Lee.
“China does not pick in our best academics, the companies do that,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘Who doctors in the field of A.I. should be offered a green card automatically’, he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Institute for Science provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other public organisations give money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Ministry of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in research on A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in the way for months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on possible change in their country's names
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name in the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbourhood includes the country claiming in Greek territory, so Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise will be at least 50 percent, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting note is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and the EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Presidents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that were created when the former Yugoslavia distinguished.
“I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paradise of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, adequate members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will make it decisive.
In order to change the name, a second-range democracy would be required in Parliament.
The national election committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was at that time only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the previous Parliament elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters arrived.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a elector in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the Skopje Parliament, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who had the referendum boycotten.
“We are the supporter of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member and not through a rear gate,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will produce essential investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I am convinced that the large majority is the advocate, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after delivering his voice.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 % and 43 % of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required origin.
From another point, exported by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 per cent would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the policy of the pro-wester government since it came to power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scoring
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a cent fluid, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian spits first played the ball in the middle field.
He ran through between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defense and was too fast for some others on the edge of the criminal area of Brighton.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judicial shoe to beat the goalman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with her and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player ticked in the ball just before he was too far.
City takes up Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hopffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The competition takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the playoff
Now that the Washington Nationals were eliminated from the playoff, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play on Sundays against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently standing for one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least enforced a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now wants to put everything in place to ensure their first section title.
“While there is no more for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimum with this public and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I like to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on a Sunday, but are said to be inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, was on Thursday in the inject field and would still pitchen next Sunday, although it is normal his rest day.
The right-handed warper of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 deposits this season.
Trump organises a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican emergence at the interim elections.
“All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives will take place in five weeks.
This is one of the really great elections, and I am not participating, but I am actually participating, so I'm going everywhere for great candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible, radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they are determined to take back the power, no matter what they should do for it.
It doesn't matter for them who hurt them, who they must push away to gain power and control; that is what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'wear and obstacle us'.
“And we have seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boos and common and false and false.”
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
"Do you remember what she answered?
Have you read the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censur me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour parliamentarians who have made us not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolutely opposed antisemitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motto for censur because I wasn't agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues as these where Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday, it stated: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was so during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am a local Labour parliamentary member.
Unfortunately, this has not been the tone of many meetings today and has forgotten the promise of a 'friendlyer, softer' politics for a long time, if it had ever started.
It becomes more and more clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed on the fact that it is acceptable to the party leader or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collegas who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed with, from topics such as national security to the European unity market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media partys that call on to reject my candidate for the next elections, where the politics of the centre are exposed and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who each day have to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that there seems to be a normal view of such disputes.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that wide church and with every 'motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller spirit.
In the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself disgusting, not simply to preach my opinion, and then I would not “come into trouble”.
But I did not go into politics for this.
Since I became a member of Labour as a school child 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Government of Thatcher which literally destroyed my classroom, I have always asked for better public services for those who are most needed, both in my role and in my municipal council and in my role as minister.
I never hide my politics, not even at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clearness about my political positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motif on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmade Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have made the end result somewhat miserable, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs rightly in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the classification, the only unhappy team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team brought the victory, and coach Peter Murchie might be satisfied.
“We have had it difficult until now during our matches and we are still unbought, so I am a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: 'All honor to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we.'
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors competition) Melrose could speak the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the precipitation to five points.
The game was long silent for a serious blessing of Ruaridh Knott, which was taken on a brancard, and as soon as the game was restarted, Ayr could continue to run through a trial of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Commander Blair Macpherson from Ayr received a yellow card, and again recounted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he handled Climo without the ball, MacPherson provided a touch-down on the penalty-line-out behind the uptaking Ayr-mur.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after restarting, after Kyle Rowe kicked the box of David Armstrong and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran is going from Still Game to the horeca. He is evidently appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craig has already been planning.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress wanted not to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blooding restaurant business” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-concerned Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sealui patrol in a marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, a ocean blue flag is waving.
On all marine bases from the Titicaca lake to the Amazon Sea, the motto embraces: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country surrounded by Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country has had to deal with after a bloody 19th-century raw material conflict with Chile is still alive, just as the desire to retain the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, since Bolivia is waiting for an Opinion of the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court of Justice's judgment on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will propose in the benefit of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of tough discussions, will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the Monday statement.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if so, there would be little changes.
The UN body established in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the conclusion, indicates that the case was ‘non-complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And the prospects of a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps become even worse over the last four years.
“The case around access to the sea has been chopped by the current Bolivian government,” said Zárate.
The warful rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the good will that Chile might still have undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Den Haag, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will “be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“take an end to 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political curk.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The statement is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the competitors in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the enforced nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is an 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and the American objections against an explanation that will end the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first takes important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism, and it is doubtful that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would reject a arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your shelter collection or keep the sun out of your eyes, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversize head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, an outstanding scene during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very inpractical hats were not thinking away from Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The outstanding piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a four-like broad edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversize accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice.
And if you want to follow this stupid fashion, you'll be lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two meters wide edge wearing, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very inpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another large creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing suitcase that the bag coiled.
The roodoranje raffia bag, disposed of with raffia fractures and finished with a white leather hanging, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the coming summer large hats and beach bags in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellentness, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continued and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a customized school course, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not trust in English only when we want to build relationships and a trust bond with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools joined SCIS show that 72% of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72% of students received A in German, 69% of students French and 63% of students in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professionally elected as STEM topics (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to employers, an investigation by the British Employment and Skill in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to fill vacatures were attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Language skills are thus increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacatures require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such a skills for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investment in language education is now important for the children of today.
Several languages, especially those of upcoming economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages most important to the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this field.
Scotland independent schools are endeavoring to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country in a global business environment, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll get the bees fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, it's almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday before the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's still to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Period of elections of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of elections
It is the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that have been loved him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate which he chooses for the vacature in the Supreme Court has been awaited, Trump wants to build support for the coming interim elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time will the Trump rally start in West Virginia tonight and how are you looking online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 a.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for Candidate Judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra loaded now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misbehavior and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI examines the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the republics who are candidates for elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign management said that these five rallys are intended for the next week to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republics try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Delegateds’, says Reuters.
“Control on the Congress is so important for his programme that the President travels to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season” said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia visited, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the spots.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him angry in the visions,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the beginning of the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The foaming swing of chances is a fully invented sports concept, but a player really believes in, and especially in competitors like this.
So who's currently getting the best chances?
“They first had a six-point advance, and now that is only four more, so we find such a little that happiness is currently on our side,” said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearful opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became more loud as his round went forward and he achieved a crucial pitch with which four races were successful when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His pound with which they won the match on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind you can derive from that he believes that the American team has not been defeated yet.
“You have to dig deep and worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their arrogant audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who books a European victory when the sun goes down above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
It is, however, prejudice to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backstage for the Spanish and the Swedish that they did not get above.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help to get your backwards.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a beautiful advance in the beginning of the last day, but this four-some session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something which some, especially in the United States, doubts.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful precipitation on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-sums of Saturday they are present in the United States with 10-6.
The decisive duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had it difficult, so they now have up to four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy she wanted to lose two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the thrilling Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could not recover its backward.
The team of Jim Furyk must score eight points during the 12 singles matches of Sunday in order to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had joined Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully recorded and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who ran himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed a wonderful move, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four-somes and together beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet, it did not run from a leaning roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a bride southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who had won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the norm for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after they had lost the first four holes.
It has only happened twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to recover a backward of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough of equality, since they are currently in hand with the trophy.
But now that they have been on the second place for two days, a counter attack seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will 'in no case' unilaterally disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the constant sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that the country under such conditions could in no case give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demanaging the location of nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the US,” he said.
'Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we will in no case disarmament ourselves unilaterally.'
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington against a 'phased' approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps took, he noted that he did not disapprove the unilateral denuclearisation a priori, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the 'denuclarization of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea aims at the formal end of the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to facilitate the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. calls for "deuceralistization first" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the constant penalties only strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader did before this week with the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: 'If the other party was in this issue of denuclearization South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impass.'
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed so after Mr. Evil President Trump Kim called a "railman" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there must still be a lot to happen and that sanctions should remain to North Korea denuclarize.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘If it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, American Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: 'The enforcement of the Sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and definitely until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denucarisation.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea acknowledged him of setting 'gang-like requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘according measures’.
He said that Kim had said to him that the "according measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards the normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow the course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture where it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to worry about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist connected to the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep shortages on learning.
At the end of my talk, a girl came to me who said, "Why do I hear this only in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is first organized this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, decided the university to organize the course when it was found that students had a severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see a picture of a bedroom where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fierceness on a night, he says, still exists, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deficiency is an increasing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student’s “secret weapon” must be to combat stress, tiredness and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deficiency causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, because he had studied with the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a comparable study program before they come to the Competitive Institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only a alarm to rise. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronics and lead lighting, which can disregard your circadian rhythm, which may cause you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Objective of Menga defeats the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their excursion again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard struck with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox was hoping for a first victory during an excursion since they beat St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt provided the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team is now eight points behind on Hearts, which goes further at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of targets compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was evidently thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh for Livingston, who knew the Hearts to cut off a point last week. He would have been delighted to know how his well trained team had blocked the opponents at each move.
The Rangers may have had most ball ownership, but Livingston did more about it.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga left the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the facility, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free stairs of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow shot against the back stake.
The Rangers managed to take over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found that he had the right to a penaltyship when he and Steven Lawless crashed after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson threw away the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former targetman at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game process, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't upset against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the exchange Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate effects when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly ran away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of match that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to stair long balls.
The Holt team could have increased its advance in the last phase of the game, but McGregor kept well stand and blocked Jacobs, then Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invasioner Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a strafship at the end of the game after an invasion with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today precisely 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day when the future physicus Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the device called geiger counter.
The geigerteller has not been thinking away from science since then, and also became an icon in popculture, for example in "Bells or Coronado", a 1950 film with the first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘se’ malicious cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malicious cells
Vaccine learns immune system to recognize malicious cells in the context of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and is then re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells saw her ovary anchor disappearing more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, then adjusting the cells in the labo so that they can “see” the protein HER2 that occurs frequently in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian anchor, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar ways to remove immune cells from patients and ‘ learn’ these cells to treat cancer cells have already been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West cuts off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was issued during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistent action in which he praised the US President Donald Trump and said he became a president candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he dropped a tirade against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
‘I often speak to a white person, they ask, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been leaving America for a long time, he said.
The issue of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon put the dragon with the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the suspected assault Christine Blasey Ford accused him of.
The tirade of West was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear whether Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
“They have tricked me backstage.
They said, "Don't stop on the stage with that pet."
They terrored me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathy it looks?’ He said that he would attract her superman cape, ‘that means you can't command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice shouted and the castle members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard of an attendee: "The whole studio was suddenly quiet."
West was a guest as last minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, raper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a execution of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of our bravest spirits: TAKED THAT YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT."
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was just "usually itself, and that's beautiful."
“But I choose to reward someone who damages, supports and sprays an ideology to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
We too, she added.
Before the show began, the rapper on Twitter had announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, "the creature that is formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who's changing his name, but he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also carried the name Snoop Lion and the dead music legender Prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution of attempts to kill after a sting in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to murder after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The complainant is expected to appear to the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The charge will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington takes out to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones of HBO.
However, the 31-year-old acteur draws out the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such rolls on the screen, they often think they should be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “there was something wrong” and he asked himself how the problem of toxic male manhood should be addressed in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently married his co-ster of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me at present: where has our maleness failed?' he said.
"What have we taught men when they grew up, so that we are now confronted with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic males, due to its very male personalities.
He continued, "What is born and what has been taught?"
What is learned on TV and on the street so young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
For something has clearly failed for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequerors or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
From November Kit plays in a revaluation of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so I kept my future family and my life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personality Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with a Emmy.
The group was married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the large majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood in the past.
However, the number of people in this manner of HIV is now almost zero, Chinese health officers said at a conference in Yuntan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is a acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
As a result of the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Diseases are often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff employees have leaked data from Republican senators and draws out to ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters objects to the accusations that one of her staff has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawyers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the accusations are distributed by ‘extreme rights’ disputers and websites.
“Leugnes, liars and even more miserable lies,” said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The data published would include the private address and telephone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators Kavanaugh had interrogated.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters colleague, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for licking these information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Declaration of Waters has already quickly come to criticism online, including by former press worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry', wrote Fleischer.
“Here you can open that she does not have the temperament to be Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to stay calm and seen."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by critics of excessive anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Eighty, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
'We will ensure that the prosecutors become known,' she said, 'and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to my staff'.
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In every new movie with a British inslag we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and this seems to be true of this revision of the Johnny English-franchise, the comic action films with a low spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-atire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exhaustive eyes and flexible faces at least manages to send everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name, you can already conclude that he is a common comic character that was thought for bioscoop visitors in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little wing Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson ever played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (who has been forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and ticks the rotor leaves to his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this movie how talent he has for physical comedie, but the humor comes weakly over and crazy enough, especially now the "real" series of films as 007 and Mission Impossible comedy itself includes as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the terrible disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the personality Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyber hacker has filtered the super-secret spynet on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain known, to great disgrace of the agent in function, unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the drop that makes the emmer run over from the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terriblely unpopular as politician. Emma Thompson does her best with this personality that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she must use a retired spy as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as school master in a chique institution, but inofficial lessons about undercoverwork. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spying lessons think about School of Rock.
English is quickly invited in Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former sad help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role under Vicki Pepperdines level.
The Batman and Robin of the disaster conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is unfortunately falling for the charms of the charismatic technology billions who claim to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odyssee of clever fun: dressed as obers they burn a bright French restaurant, they sparry on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English excreating pure anarchy when he trys to use a Virtual Reality headset to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all registries are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and sturdy the scene is, they are doing something about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: Can the British film sector really not take a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which Britain works four days a week but pays for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan in which Brits work four days a week but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want companies to pass the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day vacation.
Thus workers can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea is in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to make the country's balance toward the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Associations, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high placed source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘I expect to be announced a policy revision before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one time on the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more favourable to the workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party who supports such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the full Labour Party does not support the effort at the moment.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a policy of the party and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to take back the power of the "sightless drivers" and the "profits" in use companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'depreciation' on the basis of perceived misbehavior.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include workers in the boards of business management and to set up including property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) which give 10 % of the shares of private sector companies to employees that can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nomination before the Supreme Court with at least one week delayed and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could allow Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that might change their view.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be walled.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"With regard to Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be organised in New York, a annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will occur and a as impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate consciousness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting this.
Concert visitors who wish to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as voluntary work, a world leader emails, a telephone conversation or in another meaningful way generate awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been to go with 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just a different kind of 'clickivism', giving people the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'activities' of supporters have been registered since 2011, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the effort of world leaders and have made policy proposals for more than $37 billion which have to change life of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion have been paid out or brought together by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have hitherto affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main intentions is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential'. This group promised 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help terminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 twots from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national authorities and of Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of social injustice that is malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after sending more than 5,000 actions in which the British government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions on the Global Citizen website, which asked "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
said the group, "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will finally be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists that will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the navy to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'when necessary' take refuge to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East, declared Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts on the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited people during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with no profit mark, which is the "vote of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that they were not significantly different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a "art" with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the government of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unfair' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, made the 'inmate' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, at the value of $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cube meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition against the project is sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has led to a reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its involvement in the project again.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US to disregard the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third power involves our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts said Saturday she's thinking about it to participate in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed her thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to think seriously about it to make myself preferable as president."
Warren runs against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he "should send this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump produces in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a twoth on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for a FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, a opinion investigation published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own claims do not consider it to be preferable in 2020.
Fifty-five percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be preferable, according to a opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two per cent of them would have been preferable.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other names of prominent democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged after a notice of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son must experience, what he experiences now when he is back, I have understanding for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers return with," she told the public who were present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and are getting harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other soldiers have given for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. so that asylum is denied to victims on the flight for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as 'friend of the court' to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker who fights this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace versus Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union adhered to federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that U.S. officials have rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people applying asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reverted a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which has made it possible for immigrants without documents flying for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the lawyer-general of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and conditions of the application and that such obstacles are contrary to that principle" in the statement of the 'friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that dismisses immigrants from access to the United States damages the US economy, since these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'foresee the necessary labour forces'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges no longer to award asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view," said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to relieve all the problems, even if these problems are serious, which people are dealing with every day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeless rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her fevery baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their devastated homes and searched for valuable things they could still use in their nightly possessions.
Hundreds of people have injured, and the hospitals are overly populated, in so far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some wounded ones, including Dwi Haris who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of severe naschocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall," Haris told an Associated Press correspondent and added to this with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and to our child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper, which declared the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador in China Peking accused of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid Annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trumps claimed that Beijing was trying to intervene in the elections in the United States, marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to impress China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war in which they have charged each other with increasing import rates.
China's reimbursement rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states as Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China, and formerly Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China," as Branstad wrote in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubbles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-term tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will find indefinitely different voices at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic route, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he would not say to which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh Debacle, the Republicans distinguished female choosers from themselves just before the interim elections, warning analytists
Now, many important Republicans are arriving around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analytists warn that this will cause them a relapse, especially among women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions on this subject have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already told them that they want to continue to vote.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republicein, Arizona)'s attempt to ask for a FBI investigation at the last time will be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they did not forget it tomorrow and they did not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C..
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on "November is coming" during their demonstration at the Senate's hall, while the Republicans who were elected by the Justice Committee to approve Kavanaugh's candidate, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an inpartial political analytist, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among floating female voters in the outskirts and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President."
Even for Ford's public witness, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analytists suggested that a relapse could be followed if the Republicans would persist in the appointment.
"This has become a confusing punishment for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it is also the way the Republicans have handled this and how they treated it" Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, makes a group that helps democrats to be elected clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided about the question who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority signs themselves for the side of the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents certainly believes the testimony of Ford and 35 percent believes Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was sure or likely lying during his witness while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the plan of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford declared last week to the Senate's Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate before the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new Internet to handle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, grappy Berners-Lee that 'world dominion' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
In this, lists of contacts, activities lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this personal power by means of data.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete transformation which makes all their business models fully put on their head at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will stay as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honoured spiritual and carryer of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honourable Member of Bernard Vann made the distinguishment due to the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honor.
A celebration stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brillant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his bataljon on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick mist and under heavy fire of field shoots and machine guns".
He later stormed through to the fireline and led the line forward before he ran only to a field shoot and switched off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, some more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something, which I know I can never type on it, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crane after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a real hero shows from the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA stayed all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you'll get the most important moment not to see.
On the San Jose annex, 13 fights were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake for this struggle all night.
A fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke."
"In accordance with government regulations, no content should be displayed after 6:00 a.m. which is not suitable for children, so we had to switch to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa has pigs," yess."
Scott Coker, Vice-President of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom will have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return match, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the change, a lot of text messages went and again and believe me, these were not all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We restrict the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleaner Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt lower because of his sexual attitude, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize, until he went to further education, that 'not everyone is like I'm'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presentation of the long-term show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as a shift to the first program of Laverne, Daley told him that he felt 'lesser' during his youth than others because it was 'socially not accepted to enjoy both girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day, these feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'somebody' so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally discovered his nature.
The winner of two bronzes Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence in the Common Beast Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he made his statement because he felt happy that he could live openly without any further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-fold world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "had surprised me completely".
Daley was married last year to the Oscarwinner, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so youngly," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and lowest points.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you're not going to be there to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stirred and he died, I finally could acknowledge that he was not inconquered," he said.
The next year Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To dip for a home public during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is listening to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form to find back to not make a sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is.
Because even on the top of his career, he was never known for his right drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering balls routineously punishes.
And if the job on itself is not awful enough, Mickelson comes in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all the four matches this week.
If the Americans who support four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely critical.
Furyk has proved to have confidence in this man, even if he could be honestly difficult to change.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back, hit his arm around me and said he's ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's what it is and it's the way we must act.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never fully evolved the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had an insistent influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes having fun with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy at times last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that large fronts can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows out of experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made its debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama; we had a large advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after he had seen the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 advance on Le Golf National.
So the history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone will have to take full effort tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Enjoyed about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with business in this field.
Tomorrow is waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performances will come on, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be working out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you stand alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he has to take the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to achieve better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain, had pointed up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have aligned our line-up on this and sent the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something from the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the counter offensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is delayed again
The latest fregate of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, in order to replace the older warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and increasing costs, reported local media.
The entry of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregattes, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that a military spokesman quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have puffed the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the old fregats of the Bremen class.
As far as we know they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other key features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest fregates up to two years in a row, far away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which are designed to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already obsolete at the time they are taken into operation, notes That Time.
The fatal fregat F125 had taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German marine officially refused to drive the ship and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put into a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the man power on the fregats of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the maritime capacity to perform further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defected hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzinessing €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest fregates have in their hands become particularly important because of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Parliamentary Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the marine actually has a "deficit in deployable ships".
The official said that the problem was grown over time as a snowball because old ships were taken out of operation but no substitute vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a landscape in the Scotland highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that findings will bring new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf bat, the brown big-earning Mouse and the water bat at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the landings to follow the activities of the bats through the season.
Workers of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crying of the bat and what kind of what does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make such a detailed image on a landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of pastures and the best way to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Fleermouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, like flying catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their ears are more useful by their nightly hunting habits than by their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares on land, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes perform rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave landgoed in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to be able to flourish."
He emphasizes the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, because the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, which may cause a complete local population to be eradicated.
Fleer Mouses are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall into trouble, to disrupt or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Schots official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: "We still have to learn much about our bats and of many of our species we just don't know how they're doing with their populations yet."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of assault while his lawyers are ready to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'fair news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to accuse the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The headquarters of Portugal and Juventus are accused of the assault of a American woman called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to silence about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
By a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the accusations were reported, named the reports 'fair news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good" the footballer added to this, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing a case in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'a unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The supposed incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite from the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the room of the footballer, where he raped her according to the accusation, as read in the charge submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the supposed incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and that he told her he was a "good guy" for 99 percent, but that he is sometimes abandoned that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the few have had sex, but that this was mutually approved.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "bang for the consequences" and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to declare the scheme invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the point of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the suspected assault and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal at a value of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will regret forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret forever' if it loses its status as world leader in automobile production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no- deal' of Brexit jobs would be cost.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are made of Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stopping," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a EU exit without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already informed that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no- deal' Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, whereby every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, disturbances can break out at the limits that industry can lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock in the factory in Derbyshire, so the company informed, and in that case, production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was 'exactly agreed to avoid those checks at the border'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today program of BBC Radio 4'.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a representative of the Unite Professional Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs have lost, they will never return.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the adjunct prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can be delayed for another week while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian influence of elections, relations between assistants of Trump and Russia and possible obstacles to the President's trial.
The question whether Trump will dismiss the Adjunct Advocate General and thus endanger Mueller's independence, the Washington rodery machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to establish conversations with Trump and to dismiss the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday, when he went to the White House, rumors made the round that he was about to commit his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to kick Rosenstein 'non-lover', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing from the Senate's Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misbehavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would be witnessing both.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out a week's investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which slowed down the vote at the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the prince of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asking for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be delayed a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters have had difficulties with this claim: Sanders have not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the difficulty in press conferences was not caused by a reproach of the 'conscious' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more question-and-response sessions than any president for him," she said, without proof of this, "we have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do so much and you've seen us do that often over the past few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or is participating in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitarians on visit.
Press conferences with only the President are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made a openness and at times bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Healthcare Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to carry the costs of applying a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also suspended the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for you all.
That is why I would like to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and outside, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the activities of the NHS and to benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an acceleration surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tiger's line baker, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing an emergency operation yesterday after he had a head injury in the lost race against Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the principal coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline, and sucked there a little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie directly oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him with for further research.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgery room in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that no details about the type/range of the injury are yet known, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was stuck five times on Saturday before he left the field, so he was stuck 18 times this season.

Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, which attracts young choosers with promises to provide more affordable houses and to tell this on many-deserving people.
The increase in the physics shall be paid to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, where the additional yield is put in an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The contribution, which comes above the current physics, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to reach up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom. This is why prices are driven and it is difficult for launchers to get a foot on the leather.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically "spook cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the physics to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining the prices by buying up land and not using this and he called May to remove quotas on remunerable houses to restore the 'residential shame' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced an outstanding series of real estate reforms, including rent ceilings and an end of exposure 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "I said last year that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the 'British Dream', that life gets better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard working British inhabitants.
For too many people the dream of ever possessing a house has become a vain dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says that it's the ultimate ambition of ever becoming manager of Scotland.
The 42th Schot enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently on the third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium or Light last summer after he had brought the previous season of St Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Ministership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was elected for the B team and thereby was the cow," Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw often play with my father Scotland in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps attracting me.
However, that possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'I can let this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, this should no doubt be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years working with his career as manager, after a period of assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to the winning of the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a cross point," he remembered the time when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, I deserved quite well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But footballs can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're faced with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and the pressure of the subject, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and now it's really, I'm so good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has made the income of British pubs that have hard to survive, but also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and the fact that England took part in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern like June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were now getting even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at drink sales achieved far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also targeted for sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people were just trying to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drink sales was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food turnover was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analytics for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors for turnover in the outdoor market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover fall of 4.8 per cent in the year is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and will only learn the time if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary responsibilities."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a shared turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One out of five children has a secret account for social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Inquiries among 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, few not over 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey among 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while they still have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally encountered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmeisters" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half allowed to keep up personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are locked to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'the voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Board for Sports
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Council of the Scottish athlete world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the managers of sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys much respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athlete in Scotland will benefit enormously from its election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help to control sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn whether I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I am now completely restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that creates breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an ad in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called "the most silently carryable breast pump in the world", Elvie, producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired advertising on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to colling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled shed on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see it' and 'If you didn't watch it, these are not lions, these are my breasts'.
The releasing then continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babys, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed responses from viewers, where many people say that in this the 'horror' of the dairy industry is compensated.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected and fed to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are removed within a few days after birth" is written in a response.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreet in a nutrition beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another one added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a genial idea.
I'd buy one if I still breastfeed.
That pumping gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for too much.
This is a genial product." Someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny advertising, directed to moms that colves (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being 'cows'.
This advertising is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who crawl sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a nutrition beha, so that women have the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out while they are on climbs.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing mothers with milk cows, we wanted to place the colving and the associated challenges in the shields and at the same time show in a maintenance and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of prisoned migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly borders has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-feeding rhetoric and the hard-feeding policy introduced by the Government of Trump makes it more difficult to have children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear their own chance to remain in danger by entering a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered themselves as a sponsor for unaided minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no preliminary penalty leave.
"More than 80 percent of those who are sponsors or relatives of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, making some of them obliged to appear to the court within one month after the start of the detention, instead of within 60 days, which was earlier the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference instead of personally to address their application of a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance that they become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent eruptions or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child fights are more often ignored due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for this emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them have already struggled with.
Syria recommends the U.S., France and Turkey's 'occupied force' to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs called Walid Al-Muallem to return the Syrian refugees, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice-President, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be handled accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian areas" from terror groups and from "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the land broken by war.
As regards the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he refused to ‘disperse some Western countries of irrational fear’ so that most refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politician a case that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important bolwork of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has made a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows "explicit deadlines" and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which is 'to be eradicated'.
Mr Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the war for Syria and to facilitate the way for elections.
Moualem clarified the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second time
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidentship will be ended prematurely by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of sightfulness.
Since 2014, the prime-time perspectives in CNN have doubled more than 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers in evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a few hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxirite in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said then, "Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell to me.
There's a value of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the other on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disable is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-informed citizen, when you're watching that you've been watching a panel experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who's talking about the jack of Paul Manafort' that cost $15,000 ('a clothing full of overwhelming' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's about a reality show, is partly that he stops you up something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea you're going behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he opened CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate's Committee on Justice and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all these weird shows, not so long ago, and that people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it shows that they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Delegateds
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flow of money, thanks to the rehabilitation of a election district which requires two sitting representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-designed district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb has to take it against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were rearranged after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('growmanding') to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a crack party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democracy Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a noble victory in a well-looked special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republicein for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for aid to China and rejected it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the US Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million from U.S. aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with great unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving the United States.
But half September some top officials from the government told them that they wanted to continue the conference, thus making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a talk at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance of the government assigning the meeting, says diplomates.
And the three American messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages about Washington's penalties.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytist who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of Trump's justice, for which heavy-weighting evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is probably going to focus his research on collaboration between the campaign of Trump and Russia in a Russian attack on our elections.
When the Congress of Color changes, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he should go to account for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of terms, and I would not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, neither the fall of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices, which will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and had supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed, which followed.
The course of history turns around such bending points, and it speeds up or delays the unfair upmarch of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with various of this kind of bow points.
What will we do if Trump adjunct prosecutor Rod Rosenstein releases the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested to take up conversations with the President in secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says that the Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the FBI's new requested investigation to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and a dishonest witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I think we will not fail by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassadors' home.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to put on candles before the Sabbath on that table on which a swastic was represented.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on a visit on Thursday and know that a victory of the Austrians, after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
By a kneeblessure, the Middle Fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first race from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use the result as a jump board to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We started the match with the idea that something to win fell and came out the match with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but all over the game, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can continue and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, of all that happened to my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now a feeling-good factor hangs on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now persist, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide Research said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your wife(o)t(e) and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenditure.
Your long-term funding choices, including a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or use your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Imagine your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance needs to be applied.
Ensure full power for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate anymore.
Consider also a full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hitting a medical emergency and on the way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Set these details in a written plan so that you can handle the information.
"It's not only the financial affairs that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan's coming."
Man shot several times with air pressure guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death number will continue to rise.
Since communications have been disabled, official authorities have not yet received information from the regent of Donggala, a region north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the quake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was fourth its 40th birthday when the tsunami sought.
Donggala is a rainy that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rainfall, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central-Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nikkel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis, according to the Agency for the fight against disasters of Indonesia in the past hundred years.
In 1938, a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also increased in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most heavy earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that hit 14 countries and has a total of 226.000 lives on the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that swallowed on the south coast and almost 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake of 7.6 on the scale of Richter met the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: A earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter met one of the Mentawai Islands, near the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A depth earthquake hit the rain of Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death through devastating buildings.

Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-presidency, was arrested on charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference on a report of domestic violence and opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female famous person tried to call the police to report the claimed crimes, he took off her phone.
Palin is held in prison in the house of storage Mat-Su with a cash trip of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, surely know' when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three infringements of Class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged for a infringement of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was accused of the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the suspected abuse.
This case now serves for the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of mistreatment in the domestic atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon affected by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after she had linked her son's violent conduct to PTSS, that he would have kept his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after a earthquake met the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while expecting the death rate to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sajfello Sajpov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York City, where eight persons have been killed, a rare penalty that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a hired truck from Home Depot to run an attack on a cycling path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he travelled in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' has killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' has caused serious physical injuries, according to the intention declaration in which the death penalty is required, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both accusations, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the blasphemy with 22 charges, including eight assaults of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'absurd, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfello Habiboellajevitsch Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the intention declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was over ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York, a case in which the death penalty was demanded.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they had been sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, originating in Uzbekistan, did not show any repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his action, including the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of the charge of 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Sajpov, said he was 'of course disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of debt in exchange for a lifelong prison penalty without a possibility of refusal, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all stakeholders," said Patton.
The defence of Sajpov had asked the prosecutors to avoid the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a 'population army' at a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the "hitte" of the Eurosceptics, while one of the own members of Theresa May proposed to guide him in the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage Brexit had been minister, the United Kingdom would 'have already been out'.
However, the challenge for May in reconciling the strongly divided rows is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Colleagues maintained that she would continue and would try to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the contradictions, and thus force Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw "Chequers in the cart".
He proposed that Farage should be scattered and the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels should be given.
"If he made the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member of the House for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the cart."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had been changed since the referendum of 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed its view and wants to remain in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the March and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular to the great public, the opposition is not for votes, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are chosen.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their job when they observe their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hitte' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're here together to say, "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the national army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and concluded this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists swooped with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, was joking about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants to think well about candidate for presidentship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll start thinking well about her candidate for presidentship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be reelected in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican representative who was co-president of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she may be going to fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendant asked her if she would prefer the presidentship.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told us Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, basketball player of LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died from its consequences," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been inquired and has known to have been in the place of delicate presence, in possession of a gun and Wayde Sims shot down.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1,98 meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost put Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pitch and let Hamilton ride in the pressured tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later the pitch and came out after Fetttel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action so that the Ferrari rider had to release with opposition space on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstapen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he remained with his band choice and marked on fast finish, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went in the 44th round to the pits, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me.
The team has done its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she did not persevere to be the source of the selected letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Talking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly talk about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Committee on Justice, but he told that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unkind and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and unkind and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press messages and the leaks and that they then say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer, you've leaked the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter in which the accusations to Kavanaugh were mentioned were sent to Feinstein by Ford and this was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidentially to go, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president proved unbelievable to believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition, with his defence of the candidate before the Supreme Court, which is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonness, the uglyness, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to drive about to take power and get control back," the president would have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has recovered the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team alongside before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen with two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a restraint on Friday evening to beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
In the fourth minute at 3:35, Dwyer's opening gallery came on a assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the front, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the plan for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team reappeared and Bouchard brought them back to an equal stand with a power-play-gall at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the match, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home with Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while he ensures that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people on board could travel safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershots still harass the area and many have been buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-wearing traffic stores of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready on the startway at that time, could travel safely.
Then he jumped out of the road towers when he thought it was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may rise to thousands and inform the Agency for the fight against disasters of the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"There is assumed that the number of deaths is still rising because many bodies were under ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral celebration will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and stocks.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday, and he said to the present military: "I call on you all to work day and night so that all the tasks that are necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was already affected by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people lived.
Airline crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that run the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one other man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sinked plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that was missing one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had become watered during the landing on the airport of the Chuukia countries.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the landing course.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the landing course.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he and some others succeeded in waging the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panic and screaming and that he had a non - serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seamen who were working at a yard nearby also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with a respirable boat before the plane continued to sink into about 30 metres [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitoir on Friday in the reopening process of a man who is accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analytic of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, issued a single hourly witness as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the call data from mobile phones to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left life.
Rowlett told me that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police began talking to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the Witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to speak the truth when he told me he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying 'for my truck was then in Nashville'.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis told me he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile telephone data indicated they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says that hiphop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and the maping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had an experience in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A childwife from New York makes a couple before the right because of a 'racist' text
A children's wife from New York commits a couple before the court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'wew such a black'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the case "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her apprehension when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroide woman when she met her first day of work in 2016.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman, Mrs Maurice, who felt uncomfortable when she realized her blunder, explained that her former childwife, which was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she therefore had expected a Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple before the court to get a compensation of $350,- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to join the family internally, though without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do anything like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fir Maurice after, by insulting her, she was afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists,' told Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
But would you leave your children to someone who offended you, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.'
Compare the case to 'expressing', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Why are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic,' the investment banker added to it.
While the case is still running, the public opinion is rapidly attending to chapter the couple on social media, where it is cultivated for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a speaking bear, revealing newly opened letter
Alliance's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time, before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's huge success, it's very delightful."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, when cameraman worked at the British transmitter BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be disapproved. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bittersoet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
"But because Paddington was so vital to him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he had about Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination ability, he honored the bear itself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected she wouldn't get it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say she'd die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping, slowly worked out and left her body.
She died for a while and this process turned everything out.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't regret, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to keep up."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving about her daughter's death, stepped in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Rowing women place messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's Paste Inspiring Messages and Telephone Numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney in the English County Gloucestershire, says that her son was a promising chef-cake with a creepy grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he already stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself.
Mrs Davis said, 'I'm constantly worried that a chain reaction is coming.'
Mrs Davis made the cards, "to let people know that there are others you can go to and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was 15 years her partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on First Christmas Day - when the children packed their gifts he didn't look at them at all or so.'
She said that his death was a great trauma before her, but that they should handle it, "It's breaking up the whole family.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
"I thought that if we could actually get what he wants for each other; a research limited in time and size, then we might be able to create more unit again", said Mr Flake last Saturday, which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out of each other' in the middle of a firmly anchored patch within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been seriously difficult in five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, when the Republicans do bad, their efforts to get their husband elected at the Supreme Court of Justice in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to lobby Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, and so his wife Ashley, who was the Bush his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats meetings.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes at the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to make the decisive vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment before the Supreme Court.
Number of survivors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawyer, the number of North Korean survivors has declined to South Korea since Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Park Byeong-zuug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, declares that there were 1.127 survivors last year, compared to 2 7006 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and higher punishments for human smugglers are the main factors for decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The large majority of North Korean surrors are finally offered to the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make it easier to cross than in the severely secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreans.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often turns them out with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally in position to war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the tagged negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historical meeting between the President of the US, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, in which they agreed largely to work to the nuclear demantration of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in repealing the US penalties since then.
'Without faith in US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri at a speech for the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Delegateds, Nancy Pelosi, referred to as "hysterical" by the American Supreme Court of Justice of Brett Kavanaugh, and considers that he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help to think that if a woman acted like this, she was called 'hysterical', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Committee for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotionate; he at times screamed almost and was particularly excited when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi declared that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to set up an impection procedure against Kavanaugh if he was to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Delegateds.
"I can say this about; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or against the FBI, he is not only unfit before the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving," Pelosi declared.
Kavanaugh is at present Judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned that Kavanaugh would begin to speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law for payable health care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions concerning the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to stand to rejoice when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court', says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a righteous tired of months and years of caught anger that flourishes, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was truly helped by a woman who was leading somewhere and who told her that she was going to cry even when she became angry, and she developed a method where she began to cry when she became angry. To the one she spoke to, she said: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cryed further.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed as expressions of anger, because crying becomes essentially ununderstood.
One of my best remaining memories from a former job, in a male dominated office, was when I had to cry because I was enormously angry. An older woman, a kill business leader who everyone was a little afraid, grabbed me in my neck and swooped me into a staircase house.
"Let them never show you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an external affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catting wheat' or 'apenstrips') and withdrawn from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not make a candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughed 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, so she solemnly promised not to be involved if she could not spend $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give a thousand dollars to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"May they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach choosers instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism - that she was stuck in it.
'There will have been thought that I had a nervous sinking', Mrs Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought that Cleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my grave stone?
"She cryed?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be favorable for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were obsolete, and although the fight has not yet been fought, a gap between the two countries, according to long-term experts, could be favorable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, gave earlier this year the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion euros) to goods; half of all the goods received from the US from China.
Beijing has taken represailles every time in naturala, most recent by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion on American goods.
China has promised to equate the US every time, and the world's world's world's second largest economy will probably not blink quickly with the eyes.
In order to allow Washington to bow, requests must be consented, but public bowling for the US is much too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays smartly, it would be possible to support the trade war with the United States, China in the long term by reducing mutual dependency on the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could bring one of the two countries into a economic free fall, is actually far more dangerous than those who have recognized before', says Abigail Grace, a researcher of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specialized in national security issues focusing on Asia.
Syria 'free' to allow refugees to return, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by over seven years of war.
During his speech for the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the conditions in his country would improve.
'The situation at present is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,' he says.
The government continues rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists and normalising the situation on the ground.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that about six million people live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries who had supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup has no longer won in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn team achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was fighting almost all the tournament, left his long hit from the tea landed in the water at pair 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shouted in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in his current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olees from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classed player on the world order, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play of Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who might have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help', said a emotionate Garcia after the European victory.
He passs the flash to his landlord, John Ram, who went to the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I've beaten Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they have fought.
Short time this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We made opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud that I can be their captain.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overwhelmed."
Red gloed update: Concentrations decrease in provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
