No liberating novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to eliminate the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
The new regulation, which could have led to the way to the exemption of the Prime Minister in prison, rejected the Members during the second reading of the request for a reduction of the punishment for economic crimes.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a supposedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas in October.
The judgment is not yet legal, it is intended to negotiate the appeal of the condemned persons before the court in December.
Timoshenko itself describes the judgment as the political revenge of the regime and also in the western part of the process made the suspect of the prejudice of the court.
The request for paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Experiment, was condemned to remove from the criminal law, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan Liberation Fight or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As this region usually wins in the Islamist elections, the question is only what - the tempered or the radical.
The National Transition Council confessed on the customs law of the Sharī
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you're shortly hacking your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, execute any apostates of faith, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Coran in future out of each other's tribes.
In short, in Libya, a order will prevail that would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the Libya mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters have been helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
For their apology, only the fact that the NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose almighty power was praised after every successful meeting.
The winners in Libya?
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disappeared in the person of the dictator of a political alliance, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we would rather disappear from a military occupation of Libya.
This causes the hives to be anxiety - that is, the displacement of the cruisers.
But do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
Well, the West can eventually rejoice with the right of its unselfishness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharīa representatives.
Start of a new crisis year
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
The individual states published their information on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the prequartal, Germany and France.
However, today the bond market breaks all records.
Investors are not only keeping attention to Greece but also to Spain, France, Austria and other countries now.
The statistical offices of the Europe Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, with France's 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slightly decrease by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the prequartal, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to Tschich, the Statistical Office confirmed the trend of growth slowing economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analytical forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous year, however, compared to the previous quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data.
In the euro area as well as in the EU, between July and September, the economy reported a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analytists.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year-old government bonds was the value of 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also begin to feel problems...
The yield for Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualifications for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-designed Torwart Čech and a wonderful gate of Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of happiness, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advance from the home game and will not be missing again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed report.
A little excitement in the first half time and a giant portion of happiness in the second.
Thanks to the final weakness of the home crew, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, the Czech choice also triggered quite happy 1:0 and thus resolved their ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Czech team, they put more pressure on the Montegriners in the second half time.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be joined in the European Championships next year, and it is also rejoicing that the local football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes, a fairly fighting football was played.
Both teams combined long-termly, and in particular the middle line was played.
Also in the second half time, the pressure of home crews remained out and the wide declines before the penalty room were successfully rejected by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They made a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed on Tuesday.
They wanted to announce that they were willing to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently found in its report that Iran seemed to have given up all its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel also speaks of a possible attack on Iranian core plants.
Students had prayed to the complex in the afternoon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack in the intent to lay the Iranian nuclear programme largely lame, according to the Israeli press from the center of Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment system in Natan's attack target would also be.
The food card of a fat-dependent child: It doesn't dinner and eats to evening bread Worst
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys - adipöse children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment is for the healthy development of a person in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipöse children, worts are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the morning of the educational action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" pommes for evening bread.
In families with ticks, sports is also not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Inquiry among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from primary schools were consulted throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the Action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Disease and the Society of Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horrorly rising number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children in question suggested, for example, five times a day, in the state of breakfast and second breakfast lunch-Vesper evening - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst for dinner
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
However, in the Czech Republic only 23 percent of the students' families breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone's breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding that is not at all breakfast in every tenth family.
The breakfast is considered as the foundation of healthy daily diet.
The survey test included the day that overweight children are often consumed in the families of unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone - without consideration for weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children in question are in sport, only less than half of their parents do that - that is, only 15 percent.
Set up your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), compiling their own food plan from offered appetites and opinions.
"What Czech children prefer in puncto diet is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite meals were many meal meals, meat dishes, and, of course, sweet food.
"Alarmating is especially the popularity of sweet limonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, the ponds were defeated nearly in front of poultry.
The chicken fruits almost did not like the children, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are very willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of investigators who were filled with the questionnaire after completion of the explanatory lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", a significant shift of preferences to the principles of healthy diet has in many cases been mentioned in the results of the project.
Suddenly, this was the priority of the sweet limos, where many children began to give normal water.
The children also crossed many frequent poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main court of the day and were willing to eat less knots or sweet food.
Profis claiming - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I had somewhat mixed that this was a little too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what else would happen.
Lectures of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "place" is going.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully proven.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (none man is taking part in the course) how to dress a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too young figure without ordinary curves and others are molly.
It is a matter of the stylist to cast wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or to spell out the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, broad hips and smal tailles - beautiful and figurative insects without being too provokative.
For example, if the difference between valve and hips is so large that the rock or the pants really do not fit, you should be cut at least one piece by measure.
I'm sure you will not regret that because well-seated clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a tailored rock, you feel much better than in one of the bars, who always stands up and down, in the bracelet, etc.
Young figures can be able to wear clothing with folding, pants, applications, sticking or raffling.
With this quantity of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to get everything thoroughly through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the home job.
For each of the students was assigned a promi for which she was supposed to think of appropriate outfits - day clothing and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "attract Miranda Kerr" that you might know from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now well, this is a little overdriven), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothes out of magazines or search, print, and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our entire personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of style.
The styleist is not only physically dressing the models but also designing the so-called product page in the journals (in accordance with specific standards, such as trend handbags, mantels, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about this.
But it's only Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was immediately sprinkled by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And a skillful stylist can work with a single clothing in a whole variety of ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, so like a T-shirt or a coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes and wear it as dress.
It's enough to scratch the sleeves or the crowns up and the whole looks quite different.
"Game with it," he stressed.
But most of it came to me the following advice: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then you may hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we need to pauk all these teachings, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Quiet from fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo, in combination with other accessories, sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So with all this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you only need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also familiar persons often think that this is wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is two-range).
And if someone of us can style, then we should expect that he or she will possibly force us a completely different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has taken back or down, etc.
Jan and Mario lay our heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist needs to focus only on fashion and then the outfit "to build together".
In his work he must communicate with the people he styles and he must be a woven psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her garments and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't remove her all the cabin and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You need to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can bear," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "spot bag" must contain.
So that's a bag that you're tied to the valley and in which you're carrying all the necessary proprietes.
Apart from such clear things, such as scissors, scissors to hair removal or safety needles, it also contains outensiles such as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are scraped behind, if they are too large (tracks or other clamps are forbidden to break the fabric) and of course nuts.
But in order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to undercover shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is on the ground, you can damage the shoe chair, silence the outside.
We sticked and sticked...
With the scissor, you must not even touch the shoes, so that you don't hurt them.
So you really have to do well.
Mario rejoiced me by commending my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - devoting to style at professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride becomes completely avoidable by a series of dilettant errors for routine travel to the early layer.
Though it was possible to fulfill most of the ambitions, what is useful if nobody apparently wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the shop table, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he seemed not to be just one of many action race games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages, where the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on foot.
But how to get used to NFS is much different in the end than you had expected.
Surely - potentially it's pretty decent arcade races, but the game is totally smuggled by some overflowing errors that have been present in this series for more or less years.
So it's actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of the inconsistent foolishness of the game developers.
Adventure starts very well.
For the first time you are introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the wheel with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a variety of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that each stage takes place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that the game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very beautiful to look at this, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or upstairs through deeply cut landscape seemed very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variance into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits your sight.
In the mountains again, you must be careful not to be poured out by a lawine.
Besides, the individual races are built quite well together.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to get over the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time (classical race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single contradictor.
And that's what the police's going to do, like, that's what they're gonna do.
A news is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's rather about some interactive animations where Jack escapes from anyone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (conclusively only three).
Finally, this is more favourable, because this element at least has no chance to become boring - it belongs to the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model passes into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, it could not be claimed to be bad.
Looking for realistic simulations must look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be quite well justified by the current model, although you might find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems will only appear after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind, it is hardly expected to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no revolt on any object knowing how the car is acting, then it is obvious that everything is not okay.
Typical example: In the case of tight choosing or prefixing to matching cars, in some places the other car is easy, but in other, almost identical situations, you get into the sludge and rotate wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any further, it's all awful.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the route.
Just - in every race you only have five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, everything's going on from the front.
So the restarts are rather a tool, in case something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart is not even helping, there is nothing but learning the critical section out of the head.
Pronounced uncomfortable is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be carried through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Otherwise, "civile" cars are always found in the same configuration at the appropriate place, whether as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contrary passes before one playing to two matching cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you need to circumvent or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation always gets close to your nose.
The contradictors have further benefits.
In the entire game there are a few places where you are always overturned by the same opponent at the same place and also here again without consideration for the time.
The most crazy is to finish the game on the long bridge that is happening in opposite direction.
The counterpart must evidently get you out of here to the Devil.
And if he's before one, then he'll naturally take a look, so you'll start driving your own car a few times.
Clearly - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes also so loaded for action that you almost no longer know where one's head stands.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boring can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight motorways and exotic super cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task-mode ( challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (this challenges) and the history.
To reach a higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time linked to the online function Autolog, which includes comparing the own achieved results with the other players and also providing other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Because here you get the car into a subway tunnel (meinway), where you rush long in the dark on the rails (meinway).
The tacho looks at figures between 150 a 200 km/h (meanways), but there comes a subway from the back and drives a compromiseless scrap.
In our editorial, we'll argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming, but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying is that at some exciting moments the repeat rate slows down and this sometimes is quite dramatic.
However, this concerns in particular the accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where you do not benefit from a continuous FPS.
The sound playback is so far as O.K. and the soundtrack is taste.
In the struggle to address a wide and only possible scale rather young audience, a soundtrack a lá was created "of everyone" - but who buys a game like this for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be smuggled by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game seems somehow incomplete.
A class of pleasure for itself, but you should be prepared to make these mistakes with the power of airport carriers in your eyes.

EU Messenger Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the individual institutions emotionally out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn out."
"It will take five or six years to make the waves smooth and all get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador of the European Union, began quite sharply her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
In the first part of her lecture, how serious she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe", she showed that it was able to envy the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a way that it could have been so clear and understandable that it could have envyd this by some directors of the Karls University Legal Faculty.
Mrs Vicenová also commended the new permanent chairman of the Herman Van Rompuy Council:
"In the beginning, criticism became a criticism that he was too unnoticed - a grey official who hadn't grown such a role, but I must say it has been breathing to everyone how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a human being who is able to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, communicate with them and who, in particular, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained to her in response to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step to harmonize and improve the readability of EU policies to countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil moisture quarrel
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived and is planning to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it success.
The Czechs would have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency described it as a great negative that has seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of hands.
With the words of the Ambassador, it was not only at the Presidency, but also at the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it becomes a slim and spare budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, which she came to Brussels with: "For understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are horrible shortcuts, foreign words and special jargons that nobody understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether in Brussels you really get crooked or circumvented and various large bananas, or whether someone really wants to ban us the quarrel?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
The EU's messenger believes that the Czechs are in the reputation of being a European shipper who sees more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
Thus, the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is more annoying.
Many factors are guilty of this, including the refusal of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which was the V4.
"Believing me, when a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, then the French next to me says: "Hey, what are you all together - is it your V4 again?" and thereby making a pretty acid mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects, in particular, hard rules for Member States' budgetary policy in the future.
As much more real, as a "European Federation" it considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries beyond the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those who do not want to stand calmly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately go beyond a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues must be discussed with an impact on the whole EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters his existence in the second century
If you wanted to look for a proper word that the strategy of IBM is the most accurate, then this would probably be the word "Longlife".
For the broad public, IBM is the synonym of technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has been established since a century.
The basis for this longevity already laid its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think" became a brand to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal company magazine that was released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the firm culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to his principles and did not fear from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Throught system
Watson has already operated social care for his employees in the thirty years - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Başa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newers and merchants.
Similarly, the long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also clear.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose itself accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is switched at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been attended by IBM for thirty years and has taken the position of the Head of Vehicles, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has in recent years made so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company is almost half a million people occupied.
An institution with a good reputation
Their incremental position in the business guarantees a strong image to the company and this toward the inside and the outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of the family called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotech.
IBM has most patents from all American technology companies and five of his employees have been awarded with the Nobel Prize.
Among the most well-known inventions, such as banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, strike code or the floppy.
With about $220 billion stock exchange value (market capitalisation) this year, IBM was the second largest technology company (like Apple), and it first overold Microsoft since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the experiment with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not emotionally bind to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem building its ground walls on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
Unlike the counterplayer Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
In IBM's gains, services, software and hardware are mainly involved in one fifth each.
In 1990, hardware was the strongest represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has been selling low profits at the value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time featured like a storm around the world.
Also here IBM remained faithful to his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the great world economic crisis.
Until now, it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the reingewinn of the company is growing continuously.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
It is therefore also necessary to expect that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM story: From cheese cutter to world flies
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took over it in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history has reached back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous steak card nutrients to register the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of this new company, who was also chaired in the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the manager of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas until today, the indefensible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already revealed, began with the production and sales of all kinds of machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutters, to boxes.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its turnover to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was sitting in the headquarters for 40 years, until then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers helped IBM of NASA to lead flights to the All - to Merkur and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In the meantime, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which sets the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and went fully into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid out in the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It represents the intent to use technologies wisely in even planned areas, for example, to improve the traffic and urban management situation.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the platform "Smarter Commerce" to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is dominating in Prague and there is also a top-level research team that deals with voting technology.
Darina Richtářová over her unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her wife Joseph Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become their lover, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Richtářová offered singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have come into her dream as with her husband.
When Iveta moved back and out after 30 days, he went back to the city, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even confessed publicly that he loved them.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"In fact, not as a loved, misled old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," Mrs. Richtářová told; but she also said that she has already emotionally separated from him and confessed solely on mutual decentness.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him has brought Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, there's nothing going on."
"My wife wants a paper egg and I respect that."
"The company continues, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I'm making the shopping."
"I talk to Darina normally, just the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her from it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I understand that this is my fault, I loved Iveta and therefore I take on every responsibility.
The worst female disobedients: what about you?
If you invite the men to call some typical female disgusts, then they shake some immediately out of the sleeve.
Dear Women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines in which we let a few unsitted revue pass again that let the men turn the blood into the veins?
Purchasing
Does their husbands pretend to be shopping-dependent?
Do you have to buy at least one hater weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more for actions?
Then it's probably really a weakness in your case.
Some women are aware of this, at least trying to control their shopping desires halfway.
But hand on the heart, which woman has already endured looking for a well-seated upper clothing just so by a clothing shop and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times they've told her husband? You'd better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I had to take off at least five kilos - should I start to jogg or make gymnastics?"
"Do I like you anyway?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you'll be among the women who are quite obsessed with what they look like.
That means not to let you go, but many men respond allergicly when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing numbers of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, clean tiles and dust, scream the basket - and this at least twice a week.
Squeeze with her partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, you scratched the children because the just screwed washbasin is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room closet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that nothing can be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness in family life is not the first place.
This moderate purity fume can eventually harm mutual relations and, above all, rest in the family.
Stacks
"Smooth turning trousers come into the laundry basket."
"Will you really dress the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't wonder that this brings him to the palm.
Obviously, it isn't bad to mean, they just want that everything has his order.
If the men knew that, then the women may not have had much to mecker.
Talk and Tratch
Some women are clapping and cracking, there are twisted or even blasphemed or made bonds.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to go through such topics, such as - who, who, who with who, how and why.
Well, all of us women have a little harmless cock and crack in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
However, this is not to be confused with the biggest calibers, who are nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which, in particular, constitute a significant danger for women's collectives.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The ice-socket tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the Monday play of the NHL with two assistants at the 5:3-winning of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added auxiliary and was called to the best player in the match, took advantage of the overview of the 19-30-year-old Eishockey Star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jagr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists that he had a big evening prophesied Giroux.
"But before the game, I'll tell him that a hattrick succeeded him today."
I had that feeling somehow."
"When and again, such a feeling happens," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the Puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer obtained a short hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he reached his third meeting, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but certainly he is one of the best three," Jagr deserved his center.
"I wouldn't have thought of playing with such an ice hockey player as with him in my career."
"I'm very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear turns around," shunned Jagr.
Carolina was still playing the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went out of a penalty shot, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in a large number of two against one.
"Excellent puppies still acted in our zone."
"He grabbed the Puck, I took a ride, and (read) moved to more remote peppers."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," explained Voráček the last meeting of the party from his view.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and dismissed in the second third due to an injury on the upper body.
Besides their experience, the Candiens also fined their leadership in the penalty shoot 2:3.
One of the penalty shots was unable to transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the home crew must have pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter we only played with a single experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do with it," said Jacques Martin.
"When every change, one attack wave after another, and we had nothing to contradict."
"We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves," said P.K. Subban, one of the defendant players.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which finished a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five state travel agencies approved in the ČSSR: Čedok, sports tourist, CKM, recrea and car tourist.
The travel agencies sold only travels to the socialist Eastern Block countries at the time, in which western only were allowed to choose.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a pro-west course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Block (also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise it was not possible to travel individually.
The travel agencies also offered travel in the west, but then they had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
The matter hadn't been done for a long time.
The so-called "politically reliable" people - the condition for a trip to the West - were only granted - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to use the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most of the Czechs spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought numerous weekend houses and dates - a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czech Republic.
While a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their abroad holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that it was not possible to travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
As from the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the exchange obligation was repealed into the neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could simply not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech vacationers slept in the park in Paris when traveling to Paris, because who would already have had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature in foreign travels from Czechs was then a suitcase packed with conserves, beer and permanent worst, etc..
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown – after decades our tourists were finally able to purchase the western currency freely.
Our level of life and thereby also the average salaries increased, which in 1997 called in another important moment.
Thanks to increased demands for travel, the travel agencies began regularly to prepare travel through charter flights after 1997, thus allowing flights to negotiate quantity discounts incrediblely compared to the past.
In the late 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czechs had already had bankrupt payment traffic with all the high-developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-general" travel was made in 2000 when, thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been operated in far-distance sunny countries; in this year, they are directly flying from Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd Czechs travels every year to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States took up the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitely brought our country into the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs first spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spending more than 15 Tsd CZK per head for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the vacation site.
The main assembly is to find a new chairman - again a patch threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech football association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no consensus on the rule of election.
And without this, no vote is possible about the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June Hašek resigned from his function, inviting his colleagues to find themselves to some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old crosses between the two association chambers, which cannot agree to a common candidate, broke out again.
This was clearly shown on 16 September when the new chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the main assembly had come to the people's house in Prague Smichov, for the negotiation did not result and it was not only about the choice itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually eligible for vote at the full collection - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries equipped with a full power.
In this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion was not in place on the basis of a full power representation.
However, the disputes on the agenda of the elections continue to last.
The Executive Committee also no longer brought clarity into the matter, at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle there is nothing else on the agenda.
Although the opinions changed some times in relation to the elections - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how should we take action in the third round to avoid a pat situation?
"The issue concerns whether to take action in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
In the third round of the candidate, according to a set-up model, he won the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Mähren is supposedly willing to accept the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech page, on the other hand, is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one second-third of the number of votes in this percentage.
"Then the two front rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would question the entire two chamber concept," soboda understands the oppositions of the maritime side, which would best be able not to turn up the rule of election, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik also agrees, even if it is noted that the statutory voting order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected largely after the statute."
"In order not to find out any foolish substitute variants, as in the last main meeting," the owner (football club) explained Victoria Plze州, who for the first time candidates and, in particular, cut off in his opinions to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his view, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualifications of the national team for the football EM would certainly help calm the minds."
"If the football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's functionary, who brings the greatest experience of all three adapters and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's keeping back there.
"I hope to agree, but, unfortunately, the situation is twisted."
"This is not a matter between the people of boheme and marrows, but there are some efforts to "reprove" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a new blocking is not excluded in the main assembly."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will ultimately win," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer available.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete up to the qualification game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, so it was fevery looking for a replacement variant, as to bring some of the Executive Committee to the exhibition site of the barrier.
Finally, then, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, will be decisive.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for School, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
It's a lot at stake: government appropriations, the trustworthyness of the Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the ČSTV, which will guide the Czech sports towards the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight about the president's position because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclik, the chief of Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary main assembly could have been a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good adversary, then I would fight for him and abstain from the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adapt," said Paclik ČTK.
So the main reason for Paclik, to go to the Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, is to prevent the claimed favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclik also stresses that in the case of his victory, he intends to exercise the chairman's function only one year, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see a experienced Top-Manager who is not too much clothed in the football event.
"I have spoken to some questionable people personally."
"To believe that some said to me that they did not currently want to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"These views would have changed," he pointed out.
Most of all Paclik claims to disturb Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes on the main meetings.
For Paclik it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta would have the position of the chairman.
"With his victory, today's state would be preserved and there was no progress in the Czech football at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice bad for football," stressed Paclik.
He also pointed to the fact that Pelta's name fell sometime ago in connection with telephone hearings for detection in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta was penalty.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclik, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more late.
However, if Paclik wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclik before the main meeting in October, who ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclik, who in September made sure that he was the top of the arbitration of the arbitration of the arbitration commission with Luθk Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik himself claims that he feels the role of the Association Chairman.
And calls on his capabilities in the management of private companies, he has been chief of Pilsen last summer, who with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the Liga.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence discipline and appeal commissions, which are unarbitrarily disadvantaged to opposed situations," said Paclik, who does not make a hole from his antipathy, for example, to Sparta Chef Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he considered the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby politicians with the help of lobbying more money from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new chairman should dedicate."
"If it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they also have to say clue and clear where the money is going," he said.
His connection to Pilsner Club does not also consider Paclik to be disabled, although he himself stresses that the Chairman of the FAČR must be "overpartic".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to Prague Dukla.
"That's not ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after six and a half years," Paclik explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will loose a Patt Situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman Office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that he, in the event of his choice, will make himself strong for the FAČR to receive a new statute that will exclude disputes about the election order in the future.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will safely deploy the possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unreachable election in September, he wanted to focus on the national team and the gain of financial resources in the event of his choice.
He decided not until the last moment to participate in the election before the last main assembly, so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about the leadership of the football and present him in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is highest time that the association is directed by someone, the man who is mainly connected to the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the Euphorie, which was prevailing at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the main meeting in June, statutes were approved which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
Just the revision of the main document of the Civil Association, he used as a lock for the delegates.
"If I'm going to be chairman, I'll take it personally and be willing to carry personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which he can't be," Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognized because of his legal education and he knows well that his counterpart would be his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclik has not been attacking for a long time and has not left any dry thread on Pelta again.
In football he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were decreasing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That is why many now doubt his real character," addressed Pelta his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he had expressed in September.
He believes that his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this should be the dependent sign of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from Causa Bohemians, to the postsales of the scandal of corruption from last year."
"Just afterwards, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the six-fourty-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchy obviously prevails in nervousness.
Despite the present disaster scenes that accompany the upcoming main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point should be how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard among him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association on Thursday at the main meeting, this would be said to be a lot of people in the association.
Rajchl promises that you will start working hard in the case of your choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and responsible for the members of the Executive Committee for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work started by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player, so I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football moves forward in every segment with miles steps."
Many would not just be delighted to do this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working hard for themselves," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered not to be candidate at all.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not throw my bowl in the middle of my legs and question every step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he was heavily hesitating.
"Many people told me that I shouldn't give up because others would do it."
"This is trust that you cannot play," he said.
He also claims to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a great piece of work, and I don't just want to throw it away."
"There were started processes that would only take place in a few years, and I wouldn't want to see that they stop someone," he said, expressing his concerns that, if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him, above all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for elected."
I'm sure you can put something on me, but you don't think I'm participatory."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all right and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people argue the opposite, I really intend to do the best for martyrs."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a mahric part whose winners then went up into the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three maritime clubs play in the league, which is particularly a problem for the young players in Marern," says Rajchl.
Because the chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik has joined the fight for the chairman's function, Rajchl is untrusted to assess his chances of choosing him.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which chose me to be its vice-president and now recognizes that clear success is behind me," Rajchl, who also considers the saving of 50 million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the fact that the association does not move to a single stroke.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from the beginning to help the Czech football to new trust," he thinks the second rival - Paclik is a strong candidate who has really offered something to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he should be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek started and also the personal occupation in the Commission would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Plant pools in Ufo optics, puncture pools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hiking rest the tired legs in sprout baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on research trip in the past one and a half years, one in her luggage was not allowed to be missing: her bathing suit.
Backing on the water, she looked high in artificially designed cups, she sweaved marble puddings that were waiting on the banking edge, and astonished over aquaticly restored youth style pools.
If she felt a bath, she took it in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in her newly published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwemmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her journey to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
It's just annoying that swimming fans have to find out with blue tiles and chlorge tanks, while joggers breathe the devastating fragrance of forests or can listen to a happy bird whisper in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
Plates in the sprong pool and etheric sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, so Meder.
And if the builders have struggled, swimming halls can be a true eye-shaping: "There is a water surface in baths for a floor."
"It is, on the one hand, transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high waves, colored tiles, jump boards.
The small-formated video "Badefreuden" mediates on 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and culture history of historical wellness oases - but most of all, it makes desire to jump into blue.
Significant copies discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful health baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate water in an ancient carst cave (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose basin is filled with alkalic water and is located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
However, spectacular views offer many heated free pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the entire city in the eye of Zurich's Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in St. Anton in the outdoor pool - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the driving on the ski piste.
The most outstanding swimming pool design may expect swimming pools in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like an Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upward open shells it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the east valley rise to heaven.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool collector climbed the meder of the smell of Chlor into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell sulphur, in the Árpád Bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so strongly of heat oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water that is almost black and its slick sticks you to the skin as soon as you can slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder threw a look through the whirled windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw how weeds were growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest has been used to counter the decay: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three building phases already have this bath; you can discover not only neoroman elements from times of his construction in 1844, but also a mauric hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool carnival Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge so different styles of construction to such a great unit," says Meder.
For such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool seems to be only the next case.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has instructed a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
Then, in January, the Group Chief wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal Citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions go out of this business because it reinforces the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in the middle of October.
In this, writer Harald Schumann shows that the bets on global raw material stocks increase prices - and therefore banks have a share in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically addressed to German-Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to safeguard traders against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the sockers have relaxed from offer and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business would be "value to risk the good reputation of the German Bank".
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently reviewing the claims from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the review is supposed to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - as well as recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then communicate the consequences.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete decline.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch-Chef Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism in the financial sector: "The betting at rising prices of foods shows particularly drastically how unreasonable banks today harm the general welfare."
Ackermann is now the top bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank has to erase all the installations from its portfolio where money is used for bets at food prices," said Bode.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann's famine or the call of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprising at the first look, but it is clear that the company manager wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Head of Executive Board will not change to the Supervisory Board, otherwise than planned.
With a decline from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to be able to take advantage, he hardly needs to shave - that would eventually have his follower to do.
Every second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
It is therefore just 11 per cent that the Deutsche Bank offers investments which are contributed to prices for food.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would disclose all investments in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 per cent would discourage friends from such a bank, 49 per cent claimed to think about, terminate their account and switch to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Retracted Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels reached prices in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and lost.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern after-war architecture is swollen, by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous sweeps and new building materials typically for the technological progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler World Exhibition in 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
Schwanzer Pavillon was then given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is currently considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He announced to the architect that it was also built at the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW four cylinder house plus a shoe-large side construction in Munich, he was eventually famous internationally in 1973.
His temporary exhibition pavilion was rebuilt after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at Vienna Southern Railway Station and opened in 1962 a 20-century museum - the 20-century house was called it.
However, the building was not suitable spacious and technically as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, now called "21 house" and is now used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, among which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a happiness in every way.
In 2007, Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoviered art historian with considerable career, among other things, in the youth as an ice-art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, he made the reconstruction strongly available to politicians and monumental protectors, provided public funds and private sponsor money and established the use.
Aside from present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a café and a bookshop should be provided, and a office house had to be built for it.
Strict supervision, small etat
For the implementation, Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession had been sensitively rebuilt and expanded in Vienna and won competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavillon was a "unusually important place" for him where he had looked at the exhibitions "fastly every weekend".
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost during his transfer to Vienna and his use of generosity and ease.
There were much bigger problems during the current reconstruction: the building was "a energy sludger," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, glass facerified glass isolated glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge bearers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceiling have been resettled.
Two undershots brought space for the new use, a lowered light burial between house and road ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light-tail pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small set.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a ripe floor in the under floor.
Despite all the boundaries, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and easily.
Krischanitz has recently said a typical "Drop-in-the-City history" if it had been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels."
Such an architecture stands "ever on the wrong place" and still wants to "a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not at the wrong place, because it has occurred a city-building happiness: around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and housing houses.
And another happiness may still occur: The 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you hear it is already negotiating with the city about a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plants winter crises package in millions of height
The railway has developed a crisis plan that is intended to prevent train failure in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the German railway, according to a newspaper report this year, adds more than EUR 70 million.
The "Picture" stage reported in advance, calling for a group-intern crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around 300 million euros were planned.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weathering.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway stations and railway railways to 16.000 people.
The aim is to free railroads from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of the operation and 90 percent of the necessary weighings.
Two months ago, rail-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned against train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter, the passenger traffic train had considerable problems, as it, among other things, lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions.
For many years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Railway Association.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE moves.
The railway has also been making it have to make axes of ICE trains have to be examined more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main railway station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays million punishments in the United States
After the Tumult to Chief Josef Ackermann comes new disadvantages from the United States: the German Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industryries are still getting its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $ 145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of the plague of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a wide range of large banks that have led the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have declined the risks.
Such papers are lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and the banks are rising into the depth.
"We are satisfied that we could resolve the topic without having the parties to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not accept any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Society Banks and jumps in at pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billions of serious damage caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their types.
The regulator had also knocked other major banks and declared JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The relevant mortgage-backed securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are underlying household credits.
When the US-Immobilienblase was placed in 2007, this became a destruction of a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the climax of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, climbed.
Even though the events have been back for a few years, banks are currently opposed to a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavored a number of complaints to obtain or disclose failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complaint wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks that have overused the two US real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage businesses in a volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to make a complaint by the FHFA, which concerns several transactions of a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand straight for "substanceal losses" but not to mention an exact sum.
The German Bank had rejected the claims as permanent and declared that they wanted to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett rises with 10 billion IBM
Financialguru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies is only badly forecasted.
Now, however, he has read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
A investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight beat in the financial world.
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economic transmitter CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares in the value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management that even in the economic crisis had provided proper profits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been putting on the lucrative IT services for some time, such as the operation of calculators.
The over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful corporate calculators.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies to date.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett took access at a freight railway, at a measuring manufacturer or machine farmer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a wide range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with wise investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unreasonable sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
According to the Buffett investment, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and, together with Apple and Microsoft, is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to join him.
The founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is gripable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German state of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "blood ideology" that is now rising up again.
The murders of eight Turkish stakes and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legally extreme background.
This message will be responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
Because for many German-Turks, there is a long-distanced spirit: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with a legal extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is alien hostility in Germany was nevertheless in question.
However, the detected legal extremist network reveals sizes whose dimension is not yet visible.
"Does the bloody ideology relive?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the criminals is supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted insanely: it reminded the victims of racist violence in the weekend with a Mahnwake before the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish reclame agreement.
In cheerful colors, it had been introduced to each other - as a story of success.
Like an earfig, the reporting of some Turkish media: "German to the fiftyth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet Platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be used to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It begins to smell," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people were murdered, taxes paid and with their work contributed an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critical in German Turkish Internet Forums, the action of the police and their success are discussed later.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not have much more to look for suspects in the right extremist circles.
At least some of them appear to be ready for drastic means: "If we continue to sludge here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of information and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been illustrated.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distantness can be made in right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly accused by the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a congratulations tape to the Turkish presidents, but was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the sad festival in Cologne - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many charges the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the height of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been in the state of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive information and re-evaluation of the legal extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The scandal bank of Zürisee
The most adventureous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been scattered from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That's not how Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that he would join a nearly as spectacular new job in 2013: President-in-Office of the Swiss Great Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, the Swiss praised its beauty and the UBS of its newly acquired solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the tournament."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had circumcised all the bank's security systems and swallowed around €1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President-in-Office of the UBS has also been regarded as a hit - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been known that Weber may consult the Bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the Chairmanship in May, not only in 2013, as the Bank informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it gets tough.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and a note banker and would certainly have needed a period of processing.
With a stroke, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved again that it deserves the title "Europe's largest skandal bank".
For, on the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest owner of the world - and has been slaughtering for years from a scandal into the next.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is saved.
It began in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the conceived and solid, but also outstanding Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking as well.
Thus, the UBS managed, on the one hand, $1.6 billion more money from customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she was advanced into the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The delicate banker and later bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger say: "I always put the UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at that time."
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself, "How could I just mislead myself?"
He made a huge mistake.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Head of Director Peter Wuffli came back surprisingly, which until then was regarded as highly intellectual and as brilliant bankers.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The Bank's investment party had diluted with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to educate this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in terms of sage and announced 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but which would have crushed over some of them until recently: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund, which had been so silent that they didn't even hear his name.
But that was only the first hit.
In April 2008 it became worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, and President-in-Office of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, was still back in 2006, the second best paid board of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: The UBS had to be saved by the State in view of its lack of investment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory change bond, through which it could become bank owner.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times as large as Switzerland’s economic performance (see graphics).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says Bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and declared themselves ready to release the data of empowered customers who may have been taxed using the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalties.
In this way, the UBS acknowledged more or less openness to have helped to restrain taxes.
At the same time she lost something that had ever been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the Head of Executive Board and the Chairman of the Executive Board.
And the executive of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking by misspeculation and in asset management by helping to prevent taxes.
And just as it became a little more calm, just as you thought the UBS would get it back now, as this unstable dealer story follows: a single dealer dirty 1,7 billion euros before the bank notices that something goes wrong.
And it becomes evident: the risk management of investment banking still does not work.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has had to be found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economy and Financial Professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It was just the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago come to be guards of the world's great wealth: no too big risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic could break the world.
The traits of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of incremental reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The central of the UBS in Zurich is still suitable for the cliché of the Swiss Private Bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, which is surrounded by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have remained here: from the National Bank over the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy spin door.
Inside are the walls of marble clothed, thick leather seats, besides the bank logo, a great sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point, depressed or betrayed, as the manager of a small Swiss Private Bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, eventually, as all Swiss bankers do, even with the two large banks.
The UBS has become too big - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes have spread.
The Swiss people wouldn't have anything to say there.
"And if so, they've long been adapting to the habits of the fishing axes."
In fact, it was the Angel Saxon Investment Banking that changed the UBS, was only making its profits high, and then the Debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Grand Bank in the subprime jungle.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of its nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank in front of bankruptcy.
How could it come to this?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too large for the small Switzerland - and was increasingly growing.
This helped to supplement the two different banks of the UBS: a rich, but sleeping bank with the focus of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but even more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks arrived in favour of a lot of money to turn a huge bike.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Concern Chief of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Executive Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researchers Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intelligent, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from the bank teaching to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, overheartedness came before the case.
Staff of the UBS remembers clearly the leadership meetings on which Group Manager Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs hit from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She mentioned the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have been successful with her.
In the exchange business and in the stock trade she played with the top.
Companies advisors who were commissioned highlighted a weakness, however: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Depending on growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and passed securities on American mortgage credits, but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for the exit.
"Now in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the Euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after the other had to go as the cleaning of the trials seemed more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS became a locker seat and are awful until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has made all nearby business models available.
Bank researcher Geiger has already an idea: end with the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far the bank does not want to go (now).
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors grief.
He has now understood: he is supposed to carry out the UBS businesses permanently, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the stand in the middle of the 1990s.
3500 places he strikes.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has already asked.
Publicly, he just says he's going to find a apartment in Zurich with his wife first.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe taxes US stock exchanges
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged the US investors to take up the week.
The change in government in Athens and Rome remained without stroke.
The distorted industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of a stabilisation of the debt crisis in cuisine.
The general ease of government change in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass has remained golden as half full last week, not as half empty - but now again the problems came to the forefront, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the marketing licences.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded at the end of trade with a minus of 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is going to the end of the rise.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office reported.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore in his view that it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett took a decade of old principle over the crowd and joined the U.S. technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM supported the share rate of the traditional group and made it at first note just a percent higher against the trend in trade.

Intelligent crowns spread in cities
In many places, seed cream is considered to be "problem birds". However, experts claim that the high-intelligent animals cannot be distributed from the cities.
One might like them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been a city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities, inhabitants are arousing of dirt and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in view.
Seed creams are no longer available from the cities, experts said at the first cream symposium in the eastern freezes.
There experts from the entire federal territory were able to find out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural Protectors also caused the problems in cities as a result of the landscape of the particularly protected seed creams: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing construction and the cases of typical broken trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crowns are under natural protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 gross pairs, among other things, are located in the western coast, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen as well as in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crowns in the rural area had provided negative headers.
Criticals had described the catching of animals in birdfalls and the killing of knees as particularly brutal.
"The normal exorciation, the cruelness, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klövern found out of emptyness.
Nearly injecting water or falling trees, often have unwanted consequences, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are exaggerating, big colonies are splitting up and spreading in other places."
Worship is only possible as an exception to hospitals, age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, mayor Wolfgang Kellner said from empty.
It is possible to use a combination of ancillary animals from sensitive habitats and locks to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, "Infotables instead of chain saws" was the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different deal with the animals: "A pickel in the face can eventually bear the best self-consciousness."
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad to inform the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seed creams.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication that has much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed creams use not only tools to get to a delicious bite, but make their tools even themselves.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University have recently tested four seed creams, as far as the intelligence of the birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they had to bring a castle to crash to get to a motel larve.
Without a lot of training, they strived to recognize the size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the tough crowns had to solve a more tough problem.
In a vertically set cylinder, the researchers had placed a small eimer with a moth larve.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with the throat.
However, the researchers had placed wire pieces to them.
From this all four animals formed a crochet, with which they then squeezed the eimer on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed creams even achieved this on anhieb.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained out.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are part of the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have resolved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Posted by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal struck Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected the fifth EM participation in succession after the 0:0 of the replay.
The Czechs reached 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro, after the replay (2:0) had been a clear thing.
No more burning made Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland got a looser 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82th) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved the further meetings for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed tradefmeter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-rote map (54.).
Bosnia has already failed to Portugal in the playoffs to WM 2010 in South Africa.
In Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased an exhaust from about 30 meters to the early lead into the masks.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed his wide-shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians who did not take place in the first half hour had their first clear chance through Tore Hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the gate line (33.).
Jiracec meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, Stark decided on silver and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after a action by Fabio Coentrao, which surely transformed the Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracec also ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
The European Champion of 1976 will then take the EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionär Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) had luck and had to survive a horror second in the early phase.
Endman Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflection in the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot only nearly by the door of Cech in the 40th minute from the turn from the penal space border.
After the break, the Querlatte had to save for the already beaten World Class Tower of the Czechs, again the storm of FC Seoul had abducted (50.).
Finally, the gate soon before the end made it clear.
Turkey missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not come out of Zagreb over a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink has to clear its place at the bank of the WM third of 2002, the Croatians may rejoice over their fourth participation in a EM entrepreneur.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maximir Stadion, the Turks had almost reached a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the pitches in the seventh minute with a distance shot, the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't lower the detonator in the gate.
However, after the horror secrecy, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians were not burning.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic Platz from the 62th minute, the Bundesliga Legionäre Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni travels to EM
In Dublin the Irish first EM participation has been celebrated in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the replay, in the 32th minute in leadership.
Constantine Vassiljev (57.) was the same as for the guests.
Ireland pressed the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was so far.
After an accidental defense by Endman Pavel Londak, Ward was at the place and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about $2 billion (circa EUR 1.5 billion) will flow, the Dax Group informed on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up corresponding employees," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
Employment is intended to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of establishments of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been presented in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide are sitting in the tree country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase turnover to EUR 20 billion by 2015.

Currently, the software provider's shops, which are employed worldwide 55,000 employees, run almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", explained McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitively and generously Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror." A story of the First World War, in nineteen fateals, tells you" with a long list of main persons that go to heart.
Here is a hint for how to work: Cut this page out carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of the war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are little ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feeling, impression, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unattended men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanics to mountain climbs, doctors, car drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose members, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votiv kers in one church, some add while others are destroyed.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the devastating position war at the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" hikes with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetfly are an unresolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods over the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells after Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
I don't think anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being carried out at all.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspects, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixing ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follow individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports may be terrifying or gripping, but they are extremely alive in englunds of the smaller moments that are losing in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radiary rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about replacement in Germany.
He describes "flesh made of pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoe shells, shoes which were sold with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of turkeys, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are of honor and courage.
A American recognizes his own desire for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all this, this is what was more intended for men than to sit in the lean chair, with the evening sheet or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to do so as to mean such a fassade civilization and as if there were no barbaries behind the own strengthened and defeated shirt breast."
Inversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and nobody will notice it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the thought of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe, which falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century" : "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People act in an unforeseen manner and there is just as frivolous behavior as well as heroism.
Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to inflict a prostitute with a sexual illness to escape the front service.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in trade with gonocoke, because soldiers bought and smed their genitals in the hope of going to the hospital," he writes.
"Everyone who was really desperate cried him in his eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet impressive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war uncovered "in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly forged like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "No new in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's like he took us away with his book this page with the main persons from the nose and burned with a strike wood.
After an early failure, a minutely scheduled assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carried helmets.
It had been decided for the night from Monday on Tuesday, because at this time there were little people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. Everyone else believed to take part in a exercise at the beginning.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the dissernate and caused the housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were managed in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deportation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who was familiar with the commands said what a declaration was spoken as "training".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for secreting was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then wake back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday surgery, including operational commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, which are usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day many people go into the park, almost like pendlers, so 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was reasonable to do this when the smallest number of people stay in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the messages recorded in advance, which were drowning from the speakers, seemed to be scared by many protesters.
When public officials walked into the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protesters simply rafted their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the surroundings to intervene, arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said the association of officials was very rough.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great controversy on personal objects of the protesters, including bags, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleansing that had been released.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Images of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of Disaster Protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park by 3:30 p.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of arrests came, as he said, because of "unfair behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest unified official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "do not run the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
If they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barrikads were built.
It was possible to observe how these police locations expanded the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed driving people out.
Some 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 p.m., a protester jumped south of the Pine Street to the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place the quantity was thrown a piece of timber.
At the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of the maintainer will submit complaints against the city for dismissals
The trade unions, who represent hundreds of school careers who lost their job last month, plan to accuse the city on Wednesday, since the dismissal is not necessary and discriminatory due to their unreasonable influence on schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last way the trade unions, District Council 37, are still open in their efforts to repent the releases.
Six hundred twenty-thirds of school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the most poorly paid employees in the city and who had lost their work in a chess train on 7 October, described the trade unions leader as political revenge for the fact that last year the city had refused access to a health fund that the working groups had undergone, with which the budget gaps should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the releases were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget specifies that staff would be released from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint will take up Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education in the city as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as complainants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city was not before the complaint and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a complaint submitted by the New York Times, the trade unions have concentrated on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor quarters of the city to support a complaint about inequal treatment. She claims that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronicly underfunded.
She explains that while there were no releases on State Island and few releases in the Upper East Side Schools or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 helpers have been released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at the 36th public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of devoted parents who can organize donations to capture budget reductions."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. Furthermore, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra-financing for each enrollment in the arms schools.
The union also regrets that the heads of high schools were led into the wrong by the language in a memo, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The Memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's wage list to a pool available workers paid by the central office.
"Six and sixty care coordinators have been dismissed, not translated," says the complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to communicate about Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already to understand about the resurrections in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee for International Relations of the Senate decides a resolution understood by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), commendating Libya for the successful rebellion and American troops for their "mother".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, the lawyer of both parties and the White House argued about the voting of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of the US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin group of both parties and no vote was made.
On the same day, however, this law fell through in the Senate, and the Chamber also agreed on a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative fog fire - with a convention that was invited enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not wrathful enough to ultimately pull him away the ground under his feet.
Then the unconscientiousness of the convention was overridden by the events.
In August, Tripolis fell under the Libyan Rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "accurates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-freeness" and "promises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Agency, or will they divide the legislators, as it did in June?
The last version is the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget to have a top priority in almost every Congress legislature period of the Republicans and some democratics.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area which is at the moment to be voted at the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have unfortunately tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlattes' amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this convention and includes a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to the Congress and to the Senate - others are just slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of compensation budget change in the Senate alone and a dozen more that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors, especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their life course, the opportunity to proclaim that they have "written" such a measure.
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution which supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions which may be presented by Congress members while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage among equal sexes is, as is a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a prompt that is ever again.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws if two-thirds of the States reject them.
As the Members are proposing amendments, they are moving as fast as they have been in the past years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislator submitted 77 such amendments in the 110th Congress 66.
The rate increased compared to the early 1990s where members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to the convention in 1789.
"Followed but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview after the Attentat
Ten months after a armed man from the next distance during an electoral event in Tucson shot her, the Republicaner Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared in the national television on Monday evening. She sang alone at the Broadway Strip "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to the convention.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC messages "20/20", she ran by word and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided its head, bored through the left side of her brain and crossed their head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the convention to give her voice triumphantly to the debt brake.
In their first television interview after the murder in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "through."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded just before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The Special follows Gifford's recovery since the Attentate of January 8th.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with cold raged heads and a long shell over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show you how to perform simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A tock with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you see how the congress delegates sing together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the suicide.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read a article of a newspaper about the murder when she interrupted him and for the first time asked for the six people who had been killed during the murder.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, she said, "I was hit."
"Well, I would say, "Gabby, you haven't been defeated," said Kelly.
You were only hit.
And you're going to get through this and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him on a label.
The quantity in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the donation action in the spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, including the Stab Chief and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops different.
"They were introduced like orphan children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organisers meant it well.
I know.
But it was no respect, really not.
The contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are caught with praise for their victims.
But the commendation has its prize, say officials.
The public is increasingly acting as if you were doing people in uniform suffering.
"We were not at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support them is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear unthankable or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that struck the returning troops in recent years of Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in breast-feeding and privately between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of awe because they defeated rebells and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "writing, violent veteran under the surface" hides, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a lifted state post in Washington after his return.
During his work search, he said, he felt that some of the questioners subtlely asked whether he was able to resist the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you speak about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against," explained Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in war.
Performances in the battlefield are often taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., commanding the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the gravity of their injuries.
Military pressures are increasing to rape hardly
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-inflicting rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her boxes in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," said Lyman.
But the Texaner wash her concerns aside.
I thought, "Well, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind them, pushed them down and rape her, claiming.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military officers are worried about a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint which they have received against the former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be approved before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not taken action against the widespread rape within the military and infringement of the constitutional law of the soldiers.
In February, by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint included 17 complainants at first, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were rapeed or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or provide a proper jurisdiction after the assumptions.
Burke says she's following the chief military leadership, since the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of the vengeance? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team for the Defence Ministry, referred to by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has made an application to reject a complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are present in Newsweek, are detailed in the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which the armies have come.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries of soldiers in active service.
"The suspected damage occurred during the complainant's military service," says the document.
The Defense Ministry refuses every comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldier teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: there are three other complaints other than them.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academys for presumed promotion of a female enemy atmosphere.
Independently, the Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis "Personal Disorder" that received rape victims to release them from the service - a customary approach according to an activist like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group submitted a complaint against the veteran administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) in December, in which they discriminated against discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who stated that they were sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to the Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of reference.
According to the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (i.e.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) in 2010, the Defense Ministry was presented 3 3 158 sexual abuses.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the estimate of the Pentagon, this figure takes account of about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in March also examines the rates of criminal prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the military cases came before court, only half as many as civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the presumed rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a variety of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape seat and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listened to by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before her friend was assaulted.
Six individuals proclaimed as character witnesses in the name of the suspected transgressor, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the pains would take place, and I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I got out again I said to my commander, "This wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it inappropriate.
In January 2010 she was dishonoredly dismissed, so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other complainants have made progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of legal science at the George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he says, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which is criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine in time.
The military decades afterwards, because they do not have the same incentive and the same disturbance that brings responsibility.
He adds: "The chances stand against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the complainant, will begin with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms come," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers you watch on Facebook
Before he became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration message online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed, had committed his first public hearing in the court at an amok race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in the Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support legally extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in at Facebook.
"We have found it wasn't hard to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the principal author of a recent report from the British Ideal Factory DEMOS on digital popularism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans of right-extreme groups throughout Europe and then showed them with Adds, but instead of linking themselves to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which their educational status, their attitude toward violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having had to leave their office only once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online promoters of legal extreme groups are mostly young, male and upset about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "the ones that combine their online activity with a offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideal factories, medical researchers and politicians use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people from the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They first had to inform the party and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"By Facebook, all of this goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that similar students, such as residents, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Co-Author and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify dangerous children that would otherwise have not been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the status of relationship and Valentine's day, election participation in the 2010 intervals, and a National Fortune Index (which primarily has been used information on which only Facebook has access - Master of Digital Freedom knows for a long time that the page should make its large data finding grue accessible to others for research purposes).
But the users of Facebook know that the page observes them whether they want to do so or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to distribute its personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined directives as to how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So Selwyn, despite his years as a technological researcher, thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of socially - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Kald and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed two amoklaves in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commuter in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider of Norway," he said before a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hassyology and are thus supported by multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I don't confess guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "does not give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who gave a previously written speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik investigated for 12 further weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and riegel.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything went out on a roadclosure.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me there's a little more going after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue trap and acted quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked journalists and survivors into the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre note that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not spiritually ill and said that there was no evidence that he had competitors.
Some may like that the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the relative of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theater
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compare him to Henry Ford and highlighted the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
However, what Apple-Fans may find the most up-to-date in the newly discovered job interview, which has been dubbed out this week before special film shows on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and working processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-named hippie, but he was also an acribic organiser who worked hard on charts - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thinking" that is a really great idea 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of crafts art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiotes" about the breakdown of the staff computer. And he was sitting over an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, ten years ago, jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiotes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview" that comes to the landmark theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, where jobs clearly weigh his thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism is evident when he seems to respond impatiently to Cringelys questions and push him to take more quickly on topics or adjunctions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somewhat extremely widely when jobs evaluate what other companies make their opinions correct or wrong and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume appreciations of the career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick view of seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, so it is made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continue its efforts to rationalize the accounting of Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - mostly they began with "standard costs", which were counted on mere suspects and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the least.
How the Pope was especiallybered:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, an apparatus that could be used to swallow into the telephone company and to conduct remote conversations without delay.
About the device was already much written, but jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-employment, is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-paid phone, calling and then connecting from an AT&T network to another while they slide through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you grilled in the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next," says Jobs kicherend.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars on infrastructure throughout the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be without them Apple.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost moved off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were as well able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomats, they had to laugh before the pope came to the phone.
How he was in love with the technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone office, jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview jobs talk about how to invent spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build up the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the composition and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember decisive arguments... they screamed me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredible.
About large companies who leave down:
Long before he relived Apple, Jobs foretold the ways on which so many industrial giants, with their visions, had lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copy or printer, na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopole position is required by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, extinct - crafts art.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You took the defeat from the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your fines.
You have to vote, certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You need to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it goes out on the taste, it goes on to try to dismantle with the best things that people have created and then try to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We're always shameless in the stealing of great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws when court accepts case
On the day at which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether to listen to a contemplation of President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was sponsored by the Office to represent the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to consult about the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that 26 states have raised against the widespread reform of healthcare which was decided last year by the convention, a law that has become the mark of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour fundamental discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 Presidency struggle, which will be at the full stage at the time of the decision of the court.
The lawyer who will claim that the law is to be caught will probably be Paul Clement, once General State Prosecutor under George W. Bush's government.
Clements Kanslei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an older group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
Service included Mitch McConnell, the group head of the Republicans in the Senate and an exclaimed opponent of health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Behaviour, which regulates the actions of the Lower Federal Judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in beneficiary events of the law close to and other organisations, whereas the judge must not be a speaker, honorary guest or, according to the programme, no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to two of the offices related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This amazing fraction of morality and the opposite of the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court observes the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnered during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings in the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first law contested in the first instance was brought before the court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of preoccupation, since it was too engaged in defence of the law to be unprepared.
Kagan doesn't do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 billion dollars to land
Airline Emirate orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other planes.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company gets a order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business when the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 planes is totally at a record sum of $18 billion.
Also unusual is the contractor of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the coming 20 years.
In the weekend Boeing announced his largest order for commercial planes, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates Airline from Dubai.
Furthermore, Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Airline View, the airline has an option to buy 20 other aircraft that will increase the total list price to $26 billion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered the gas consumption and comfort of passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a stock exchange professional of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oilproducing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the planes, but a rise in oil prices that usually harms airlines, since this is one of their largest cost points, not as harmful as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move flight orders when oil prices rise,” said Dihora.
"You have a natural safeguard," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeings' leadership on the market for large-space aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess, which attacks the headquarters with the A350.
Boeings' victory on the airline view comes four months after Airbus has announced that the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER, would be moved.
The introduction was deferred to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher load of benefit and scope.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported Fausto Vallejo opponents from the PRI in the race around the governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. On Monday, she claimed that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of their opponents.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around governor's positions in the western state from the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially last day is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the surveys ... you have occupied electoral cabins, built road blockads ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacane is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, which had led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a victor.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the currently official governor, came to place three, a severe defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the Presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was dominated for a long time by drug cards specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a militaryly conducted offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an electoral event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have gone out of fear from local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, regardless of the opposition of the elections in Michoacan.
The man who is probably represented in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will give us a courageous look in the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the eurozone
Asia's Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downstream that will slow down the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB seated in Manila, said that the two most rapidly growing economic nations in the world must do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who look "unfortunately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said to the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
Europe's monetary union has suffered from a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have retired both from Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe fears that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls on the leading threshold countries to join themselves to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any aid from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Ministry of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro area, since its own economy now suffers from the decline in exports and the drying foreign capital flow.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain instable and turbulent," he said.
"We are faced with major challenges and we need to have a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the opportunity to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell 1,2 billion people in India help to Europe, of which more than 800 million dollars or even less live a day.
"They will eventually find out that the Greeks with 50 are retiring and spending holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economy Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly directed, losses of institutions such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" on all Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/ threatens "the risk of grading" due to the threatening risk from Europe.
He said that injurious threshold markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta called on the assembly on Monday when he warned that automatic budget declines would unnoticed weaken national security and thus triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil flows.
The Pentagon already considers reductions of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that further reductions will be necessary by $600 billion or more if the convention cannot reach a final conclusion in expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budgetary agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a unconscious way, would make most of our ship- and construction projects inappropriate - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernisation efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a large majority of our civil staff unwillingly and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with a certain probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would devastate the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our warning."
The reductions were finally hit the battle troops," said Panetta.
"While the wartime quotas in the anti-terror combat are not directly affected by the combat, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war efforts," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting oversight that support the war."
"The wages of the staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to war-time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic reductions on the Defense Ministry.
"The consequences of the confiscation of the Defense Ministry would begin a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are inferior to this draconic act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not a thing that we should be pressed."
"The composition is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or will reinforce demands to exempt the pentagon from shortages remain awaiting.
Panetta has increasingly unblemished the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister painted a dark picture that could be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air weapon sweater without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paper-tucker, a army of cassettes, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening talk at Pentagon.
"There is a army that lacks morality and alert willingness and which is not able to take it up with potential opponents."
"She really makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta mentioned new details as to how reductions "creating significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global use and accessibility, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of striking could be victims, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new soil fighter, which needs army and navy to replace the Humvee.
If you would stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to rear up, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Destroy A Lie
A view of the current headers shows how considerable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The President-in-Office of the Republican, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the accusations of sexual harassment since several women.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of Minid because it is said that reports have been kept back after which a retired football trainer has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
lies destroy career and shocking countries.
The New York Congress Assembly and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he brought rejections in circulation that were very rapidly resisted by indispensable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringements in the campaign financing, which is linked to the provision of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circuit that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office at the Oval Office.
Stories of foaming in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers have provided their students with the test answers so that they were well aware of their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and foams are okay.
How much deceit do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as liars.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for all people, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, where it is the goal of calling "Have you!" is defiling a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected at viewed universities over the past six decades, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physology.
One of the results of research is that most old myths have been discharged about lie.
Liars look into your eyes.
They're not always stumbling, stumbling, red, and scratching.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to discover and defile.
A practiced lie-in-the-tarner can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine face expressions, the questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of depreciation. And it is clear that defiling a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to remedy in our complex world, especially if the setting or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in appreciating other people, waking their interests and dominating their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people are more frequently lying than introverted people, that men optically oppose "self-storited" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - they usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person was disappointed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty to have lied to this person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughing, the voice quality of the test person.
You should better know when someone normally triples with the foot, so they do not accuse him wrongly when he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulations of remarkable verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells screaming, not as proof of depreciation.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet turn towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position significantly, or show a "relax after the setting conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing and the change in attitude when all hard questions are over.
Askings often falsely signal that a interview is over, only to keep a look out after this relaxation after the setup conversation.
Be aware of the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's excavator is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceivers can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a tough question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tough question, "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... for best knowledge and conscience."
This will make the answer more perceived than practical, often shrinking alarm bells.
There is no torque to declare lies, but you can learn capabilities that make it possible to declare.
Thanks to these capabilities, everyone can become a rarer victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the authorisation of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which has arisen the trade unions and at the same time reassured environmental protectors, the pipeline building companies are trying to re-plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the House building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline is finally approved, although with a different course.
This was done after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be held until the new possible history was reviewed that avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may remain a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was linked to the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 Barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline had to cross six states.
They hate environmental protectors, but they love labour markets because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the lawyers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, deviate the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy economy indicates that the Ministry's principal auditor has requested a separate sentence of the audit procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was dismissed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company responsible for conducting the original study was an unappropriate choice as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she claimed to have a little child for fear to break up
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her manhattan building would have had a mortal attack that would have scared her little daughter so that she had surrendered of fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stageworker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm to the lobby in her building on the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman wrathfully.
"She said in an aggressive sound, "You shouldn't put your daughter off near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to cheat - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started caught water from the bottle on me.
She said Geneva had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you have done to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be retained by her accompanying and pulled into a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family in writing apologized but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is on a non-specific damage replacement, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he wouldn't take account of a honourary and plan the family, the money she gets, will donate child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed on a child gardener who has a 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate contradictions in the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment and black work grew in Sinaloa, while foreign investments went down and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloa will remain in mind. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and gives rise to great hopes regarding economic growth, is at the government. However, as a result of climate disputes, growth cannot be spoken of, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions of agriculture, but also engraved the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity in the first quarter, with 3.6 per cent. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which broke its impact on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agriculture) about the impact of frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural property are damaged, of which 78.03% were perfect and the rest of 21,07% were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía has observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, since 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa did not have employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the employment population. In the second quarter, unemployment rates increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting from 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year depends on several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments on the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, it is not easy to allow them to work for themselves, to invest or to use it for anything else to combat money laundering in the Congress," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country on looking for work in abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due to the problems of entry and, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high share of black work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of the employees in the country who are working without paying into the social insurance cash.
Employment and black labour are the lowest wages in all Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the total state average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the past ten years is recorded. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority) the ADI was $630.597 from January to June, which is 87.74 per cent in comparison to $5.43.312 in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) represents an overall investment of 17.280 000 pesos in 2011, which is mainly originating from companies from the Tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government in July applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdés' government inability was revealed in the first year of government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), represented that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very necessarily this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to work twice. The efforts of all the government teams that have already been well agreed have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy that is not in motion enough to create an economic dynamic that could create a acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine calling
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Company of Mexico) in Sinaloa, declared that the State should be motivated to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have seen that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for redetermining the economic calling and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts to better railways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current government power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days for the property of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The State Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, which was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of Marihuana for trade.
Pursuant to the Act of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military on 7 June 2010 in the monitoring of the road Cipriano Valdez against guard No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white truck in which he stored a black bag in a cart and a small backpack on the carrier seat, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the consigned product was transferred to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the execution board.
Debts for construction
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are in danger of not being completed for lack of funds or only with a great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that even though the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the funds to which it is granted, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes is nearly 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. To date, only Federazión and the municipality would have granted funds to construction work, so that a delay in the closure of construction would be expected.
"12 million have to pay for them, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a phennig, and that, although they had to pay us part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled his obligations, so at the beginning of its reign, the municipality had to take a loan of 7 million.
"This had already happened to us during the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to acquire the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he executed.
Although the government authorities are obliged to pay these appropriations, he commented that the Ministry of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Only 12 million people have to contribute, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us phennig."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) pointed out the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Members against the presidial release, and to which the shift of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be rejected, due to the lack of eight votes required for the contested law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the law decree with details on switching to the earthly digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the Court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The project for the complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed to explain the Constitutional Decree, since the regulations relating to the radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which would therefore contrary to the hierarchical principles and reserves of law.
The benefits of the project were Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members of Constitutional Disputes against the Decree of Law, the Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and launched all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Members without participating in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government of the countries may not regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be impeded." She also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for national matters.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the last few years around the world, and it improves the use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the conversion, she said, is a delay in the exploitation of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest that has not only technical aspects, "for it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of features laying the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital conversion, even though they had highly specialized institutions, over the government.
It could not be concluded that the government would take into account the competences of the Congress with the issue of the contested decree, because the laws adopted by the Legislative would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting rates in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is nearly 27 per cent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the single counting of the voting list is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the programmea de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not been counted.
In this respect, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that last 9 November the elections office had adopted a number of rules for harmonising local rules with the reforms of the federal states in election matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his voting law nor his law on election law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State indicator within the time limits set by the Congress with the argument, or objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative and judged the vote of the State officer on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful", since it does not have the right to "decision or a veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview the possibility of individual counting the votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the possibility for the local election authority to count the voting lists partially or fully.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on the counting and calculation of votes is not currently present or is not in possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total counting of the fully filled electoral certificates may be made if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one on the second place that is equal or less than a percentage, provided at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman who is the second of those candidates.
The number of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate at the second place is equal or less than one percentage, provided there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the choice packages suspended by partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is nearly 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be spread across the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remnants of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés set down this Sunday evening at Saltillo, its birthplace. On Monday, the dead sight and a dead messe took place.
According to family members, the Colonel's last will was to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After one honour, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others who died in the accident, in a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The Colonel took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 a.m. in the morning, the chief lieutenant's ashes landed at the sad hall at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends came.
At 17.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. It was caused by his former students from the technical abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio during his preparation for the abiture.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread across the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he was in the abundance of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always admitted to his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of Zapopán Air Forces, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck, but he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he was driving to Zapopán to graduate his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A Last Goodbye
The Chief Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted under the leadership of governor Jorge Torres López with all honour. His honor was given him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, School Manager and Students of the Saltillo Technology Educational Institute, where he studied in 1985 and saw as excellent both in study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flyed by him, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority also crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the remnants of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met in order to be delivered to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the premises of the Caserne, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other family members, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a land on the Cadere surface NL
Some hours before the finding, military members presented the media with eleven persons arrested in the same village in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in a abandoned Finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the km point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality El Castillo.
Several temporary people saw that the door of the land house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood locking.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons in the interior, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes, and another was dressed with a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to local information, the three persons must have been murdered elsewhere, since no cartridges were found.
On the wall of the house, recipes are read that write an organized criminal band to another, and several deposits were found in wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadere area
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for State Defence) presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal course that was mainly in the place of Cadera area, and who were associated with kidnapping, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret burials.
After public information, eight persons were arrested in Los Alveros' settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.

On Wednesday Education of the New Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government that has led the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakthrough.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government that has led the crisis that has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakthrough.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm government formation on Wednesday.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of technically composed cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well decorated," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt into an intolerable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard saving package that the euro policyers demanded to regain the inflicted confidence in Italy.
The pressure to speed up on Monti continued to increase by the swinging market situation, due to the burden of the Italian government bonds for 10 years by 7 percent interest, which is the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in all powers."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The success chances of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to retire as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of technocrate government, which forms Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti Government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delaying of reforms could once again result in a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneur associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The meeting round is supposed to be completed on Tuesday.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change in government in response to the crisis.
After a short breathing at the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would resign, because of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
A salvation of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties are insisting that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed on the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the involvement of persons from political life.
Spaniers have more playgrounds than the Ticos
From 22 players from Spain, ten more than 50 international games are on the base.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of 22 invited 50 games has left behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at the National Stadium of San José is compared with each other.
While the world and European champion, the number one on the monthly ranking of the FIFA, can look back on a considerable number of selection games of Class A, the three-colored team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Champions) as well as high-level Europe Cups, such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences of the Spanish Furie in complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships are included.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA track list.
We will see how the Spanish crew draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Download 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received an recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian crew who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storms of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number Hundert is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61, and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left sidestorm Junior Díaz is with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five to over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games appear in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even closer to the 20's border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson haven't had their debut yet.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and parks.
The Quintett took Costa Rica into his tour to celebrate his 20-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that takes place"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
More than 20 years were expected, but the band assured that when they play in Costa Rica, a dream would come true for them.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate their 20-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will appear at the National Stadium at 7:30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an extract from the conversation whose complete copy can be found in the online release of La Nación.
For your costarican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also takes place for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been on holiday in Costa Rica once. It's a so beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you that because the fans of the band are completely devoted, they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We spent almost 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long until we came here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that exercising some pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatst shows we've been making in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in São Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic with the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unpredictable.
My friends always traveled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, the outstanding areas are for surfing. In this way, about people who love to surf, we have learned about it.
With a view to the tour, you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we're not setting any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile stock.
You never repeat your stock.
Why?
I think that is partly so because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven't played anymore into the stock, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us because they call us the reasons to remember why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year story.
If you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
At first, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and that for more than 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and it is great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the time of birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We're good friends with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement appears from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound yards on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and honor us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands remain.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate ourselves happy to be alive and also take care of each other.
We are all close friend, so musical ways have opened that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One is familiar with the other and his music.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be on tournaise too often, because it's too easy to run this game with huge people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come for music, it reminds you that you have to watch for the music and what it has brought into life, without being a famous rock star, and that has never interested us.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us, friends. When I see a song or photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band therefore chose to open up?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. Therefore we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sing the first thing he can find.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
One of the first ones I believe is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists who like me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all do not feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I agree with the bands I mentioned earlier, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others who came up at the same time. Even though they are important today, I find it great, because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly easily. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive in themselves.
To both of them, the tears came to me when I heard how Ed played them. They're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly represent it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical investigations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, 25-year arrest for violation of human rights during its reign period (90-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operational and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, said to television that Fujimori would be investigated for three days in the Peruan Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower parts of the body.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be gracious for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. Additional diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyste in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death swadron of the Peruan army, which was in secret during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official appointment, mentioned by the Uruguayian President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between both countries and discuss the political issues of the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets with his Mexican official colleague Felipe Calderón. This, according to the Uruguese President, will be the climax of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayer living in Mexico.
The discussion of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the South American President Office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks the support of Calderón as regards the interaction with France when the French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 Summit in the French city of Cannes.
In its discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries who still exist as tax paradises from the international community, which were rejected by Uruguay and led to a request to his ambassadors in the European country.
Since November Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group of the most powerful thresholds and industrial countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double inclusion with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has attempted to accelerate the concertion of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the 'gray list' of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At business level there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snorrberry installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years, Super Mario has fought in tired for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil bowser, but never in three dimensions until now: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo technology.
The game that comes to the store covers of all the world this month has been cut to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special glasses three dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because until now success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that even though it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "safety" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "slight" to capture the less versed users.
Afterwards, experts on the different playgrounds, which becomes more and more difficult, can turn a "second round".
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensional.
This Super Marios trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twinkers the fans of Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The snorrberry installer has to overcome tailed platforms with dangers to liberate the princess Peach.
However, the player finds news in movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would be delivered by former governor Alfonso Portillo in order to be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
In this way, the case of the United States' request for delivery of Portillo will end so that it can be brought before the court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he had not intervened in court decisions and had taken all the requests for delivery which he had been informed of.
Except for Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Coloms is a government act which takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances are exhausted for the condemnation of the former President of State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation in Guatemale is cleared and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign period, which predicted the delivery, but the minister made contradictions and revived the case.
Trinyove has helped 6000 young people who are threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was introduced to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Social Aid Organisation Trinyove have led to important results: In this quarter of the century, 6000 young people were supported by socially threatened people to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the anniversary, at an event yesterday in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, over 300 people attended, were held in balance.
Trinyove was launched in 1986 in the city district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
On yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous representatives of institutions and institutions who have cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions to election times proved the inpartiality of the work done by Trinyove.
In addition to the President of the Generality (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinyove was brought into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinyove is an example that is aware of the difficult situations and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house in which giant parties were organised was cleaned
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 at Balmes Road have found an end.
Twelve people left the building that they held illegally and organised huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair last night.
After the removal, the door lock was exchanged in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house manager.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of them were inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. They also had painted the walls and left all types of waste, especially boxes with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge festivals were celebrated, which took up to two days and drew the tenants to despair.
Besides the building, there is a Discothek, Balmes 51, which also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the house crew.
The owners of the Discothek pointed out that the householders made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
Moreover, the owner of the recreational room was shown by the neighbors because of rest destruction, while, according to their statement of noise, the visitors of the disco were not affected, but by the house owners and, in particular, the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the exaggerated neighbors, became increasing and longer in recent weeks.
Discothek's responsibles explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Stadt Police) also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week to clear the building immediately and to tackle the problems of civil cohesion and the descendation of the city district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the house owners had been in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, even thefts had come.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the injustice and to take action against the social acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the city district of Nou Barris was cleaned by the Catalonian police.
At 15.30 p.m., the police approached the street of Montral No 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanting to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the tender, except for the disputes on the honoraries.
The city procurement on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the climax of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) disappeared, this administration published its blame on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many back to the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (bergs) and down (more).
The classification of Collserolas as nature park plays with this idea.
It was now not the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a giant tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or somebody intends to put gates on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The subscription is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city, the theme of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive topic to which two members of this oldly embedded box, which meets in the elevator, can take place.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare conformities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" after the attack on the coast to talk about the "Front on the mountains" in so far as the discurses of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"The principle should be that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it's accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it should be considered not "as access to a park but as a restriction of areas to which action needs to be taken."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be an "intelectual challenge" which presents "some dangers".
Risks caused by the "uncertainty which brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "Swansangs" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own restriction to what can be built.
"Limit something always means to determine the next step," that is, to cross it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who keeps closer to the question, means simplifying the side of Collserola, going towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona" for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study from the cartridge de Collserola that shouldn't "take on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving its body the opportunity to participate in this project "for the first moment".
He also notes that the nearness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter, which enables architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubts about whether this technological profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("just the right", he says) that "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex because in the terms of the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: "There were 16 cross-cut competitions," he says, "on the axis of the mountain-mere. But there are no long-cut perspectives that view the area in its entirety."
This, at least in his case, has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate.
In his view, the city must ensure that the stripes are equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between town and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the officer of the Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that is led against him because of suspected oppression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the advocate of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the second judgment of the district, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for oppression.
After the Attentat on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is seen, which presumably forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration authorises the secret operation of the competition house.
After the punishment, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistian mayor, arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the Ministry of Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 at the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
There he stayed 49 days after a second arrest order, after the Ministry of Público's official had rejected crimes for bribes and organised crimes.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison because he probably had bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the central security tract, as murder threats were present against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an assassin of San Nicolás de los Garza City prison.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, was sent to him by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, a detention regulation which found that, after the nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Contesting House to open this in return.
This Monday, the officer of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to impose the punishment to the brother of the mayor, so he will be released in the next few hours.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had repaid the damage and which the owner of the contest house had forgiven. However, the lawyer kept the name back.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also, there is no objection against the process, and no replacement is required.
After hearing the Competent of the Competition House at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately placed on the free foot.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, drove to San Nicolás de los Garza City prison to notify Jonás that he had been released and that his case was placed on the file.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome informs about the aircraft accident in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons were killed, pointed out that the helicopter with its entire uninsured structure was tailored directly against the ground without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees in 25 meters, whereas the helicopter lost the rub, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he satisfied all the conditions for the transport of staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations on the field on which the machine had come down.
"When searching, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the slope was the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he satisfied all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and assistance services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidential had flooded on a trip speed and the plane had fallen on a soft deck.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the explosion."
At a press conference, the Head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the perspective flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient sight during the flight and on the ground.
Rectangular conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds came up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Retrofit point:
The co-ordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. It may not have been a loss of control over the aeroplane or a deviation from the flight route before the aeroplane.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to the present time suggests that the helicopter was in a straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane resistance is to suspect that the helicopter was strolled up to the ground with its unprecedented structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site do not close to fire or explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicate several soil contacts.
During the local investigations, airplane parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is absurd and has a cutting of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter probably has broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several soil contacts.
After a minutious search for an area beyond the locked area of the accident site, no dispersed parts of the aircraft could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the uninterrupted aircraft structure had been plunged against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for fatness
It leads a research project for finding the gene for fatness in children and adolescents supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico's Social Insurance Institute) announced that it leads a research project for discovering the gene for fatness in children and adolescents under the title "Genetic of fatness in childhood and youth" to find genetic brands associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Directive for Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students at the postgraduate study at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Participants may come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday tests are carried out with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation started at the athlete of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of México) and continued since October 8 at Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México).
When the target is reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study is continued at the sports square of Independencia (south of the capital district) and completed at the site of Morelos ( north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in the development of fatness and identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the global day of diabetes, he declared that three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 were to fill in food-related questionnaires with the consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal impairment.
He further reported that on these Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, tailles), controlled their blood pressure, and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (experience of gene identification related to fatness in childhood) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys showed that in nearly six years the proportion of fat boys increased by 77 per cent and that of girls with fatness by 47 per cent. Overweight increased dramatically," stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He argued that the search for genetic brands was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico varied from the other peoples.
He argued that an (e) Mexican (in) averages 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African derivatives, reflecting in the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fatness are pressed into the inability to burn out the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be established whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark folds of skin in the neck and in the interior arm (akanthose), indicating the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and the parents would be informed in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all measuring results and suggest them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, fatness and other chronic diseases: a lack of movement in everyday life, most of the time of the day before the television and using means of transport, instead of walking shortly.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugared drinks and hydrocarbons (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico, UNAM developed polymer-modified asphalts to make the mix more resistant to the weather conditions and temperature variations
If the rainy time in the zone Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nahjera, researcher at the University of UNAM, would not need to repair nearly 200 000 holes, warning and assured that if the interpretation and maintenance of the asphalt stock were adequately achieved, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "technical holes", which he held on the basis of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahjera believed that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road crew and thus avoid the occurrence of holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon link of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called maltene. Together, they give the road stock its characteristic tealastic behavior.
Asphalt sealing means that at high temperatures of nearly 180°C it acts like a liquid, at 120°C it is very volatile and almost fixed at 50°C, while it becomes broken at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on one day in dependency on the conditions and temperature variations," the chemical engineer concluded.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible road cover, which consisted of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the upper layers, there is a layer of asphalt, which is bathed from small, asphalt and then consists of solid stones.
Each single stone of this sleeve was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of powers in the road coating.
"If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"About the sliding layer," he concluded, "the last layer is designed, which is known as a cargo layer consisting of small stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle rippes, they need a greater mechanical force than the sliding layer and it has to repair.
The main forces of this road coating are received and distributed, the cargo layer also needs a proper thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to be taken into account, above all the water," he said, "for it significantly affects the behavior of the sliding layer.
When the site is moist, water penetrates into the layer and comes out difficultly. This causes a rise in all layers of the road coating and consequently the occurrence of holes.
When a slaughter hole arises," he said, "it will first be carried off the cover, while the sliding layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Lastema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico’s National Research System) stated that vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of holes. Therefore, the thickness of any layer of the road carriage must always be in proportion to vehicle load and it must be ensured that this system is respected to avoid frequent holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still waiting, for example about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the holes were easily and without use of high temperatures.
What was missing by the candidate Del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner's podium, a silver crown and the band that she shows as new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the ceder in her hands, the department was already on 14 mistitles and Melina was sold to the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown nearly in hand. Among the proclaimed misses were Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many today ask is: What was missing?
For the result is the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing, she was elected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty kings Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the jury's decision to appoint it as the first miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has affected you most and why?" which Martín Murillo Gomez had been put by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I think it's a way to civilize, finally I believe that the book that was most powerful for my childhood is 'The Little Prince' is a very deeply moving book.
At present I read `Schuld und Sünhne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book from Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that calls 'Leidenschaften'.
A reply that stood on little compassion, first because of the term `sich civilise'' and second, because she had not explained specifically the way in which each of her books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony concluded, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one who had all appetites and who had received all the prices in front (Gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-croped costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous of what the queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on the stage."
And this was seen at their first show in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two elevators at the crown celebration.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and vibration of Magdalena and Atlántico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" programme at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to miss "does show that the candidate who wins most prices during the competition will not even become Queen."
In addition, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of national beauty competition.
It will have its reason for two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You need to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that she had worked on the competition in projects before participating," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derriere and Fibrose, which were noted in the abdominal area. But this is inconsistent, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was honestly hard to notice for me, expressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos believes that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgery she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay it."
Because of this price, which is for the first time awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a terrible prediction was created after the show in the bathing suit that should be fulfilled in the night. It was trickled that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price to not let her come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina, from today's date, enters her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent at the appointment of the national beauty competition Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, she is one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, will enter into history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopy from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On last 4 November, a Lophoskopier of the State Prosecution Unit (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armies of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopics in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a willing service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to identify him.
In 2000, he seated over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to wheat, i.e. the hands and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night, he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla of the world could be his. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger printsheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, for this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, didn't wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Trace search
For a dakcyloscoop from Sijín in Cali, the assessment given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the action against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The daccyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopics not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false identification documents or they do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The scientist told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house at a diet, because the thief had just risen up with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or loaded.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by snack bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected, and a fingerprint on the bottle actually agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he will be associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A daccyloscopy of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take them.
Then the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the person's office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," explained the CTI expert.
He said it wasn't all the way it was represented in the TV series SCI.
Just like not all gold that shines is not all you touch is a fingerprint.
Yet, it can be used when you make a corresponding comparison.
The "employment" calls for the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators joined the Zuccotti place in tents.
A large part of it came after the flushing order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called out the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhatten place again with a court order after they had been removed from the place in the morning and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators collapsed before the Zuccotti spot, on which they wanted to enter with a judicial order that allowed the "employees" to enter the new tents at this place. In the meantime, another part of the movement remained on the embarrassing command and occupied a park further north of the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means of returning to Zuccotti with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray argued that the answer of the "employers" to the evacuation of her tent camp, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came before the court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the violent rumble of the place and approved the demonstration tent.
In addition, the "employers" occupied a new park, which is located at the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entry into the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupie the place for at least an hour, but after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray couldn't give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support for the members of the movement and to communicate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti site (a private property site) remains closed in the expectation of a judge hearing that is still held for this Tuesday, and in which the legitimacy of the ruminants found in the morning will be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the place carried photographs of this judgement with themselves and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who watched the place, which resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, who had suggested that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from their place and the use of "states which were adopted after the occupy and prohibiting the demonstrations with their tents and other things they had used before to return to the park."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that because of this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the place for public transport and demonstrators has been suspended. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the space of the Zuccotti place, which was arrested nearly 200 people in the morning grey, and it was decided because the demonstrators "rejected the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it had "converted to a place where people did not demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others" because "some businesses had received threats" and the inhabitants feared "of their quality of life".
"The roaming in the morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement who accused the mayor to "not respect the freedom of press."
The responsibles of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they strive to organise "great actions" for Thursday, together with communal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have lasted since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbits at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will occur on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special virgin Mary's life.
Today, CTV distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson - also appearing for the distribution on the Internet of a self-rotated pornography, in which she appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shoe that Jesus is supposed to represent - with her former husband, the sleeve player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee.
In the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderner at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen as Jesus' child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only set on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and which is not remote from this controversy.
On one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American lady Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, which was still in the healing of the devastating earthquake, which emerged into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced was World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damages to $300,000, a stroke that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situations.
After three quarters, the gross domestic product data were used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained partly by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas desolate by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uncontinual increase.
Nevertheless, the actual conversion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which is currently 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, affected by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and recreational employment.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - escaped into one of the "refuge currencies" of investors who, before the debt crisis of the euro area and the debt forecasts for the U.S.A., are a privilege that is charged like a grave stone on the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the notation of the Yen.
While the markets continue to combat the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains alert.
"You need to take care of the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid revaluation of the Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clear signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator that predicts the turnpoints of the world economy showed that the largest economic potential would have pulled the brake.
Because he dropped by four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even below this average value, which is 100 after its fall by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubt
Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to mislead in the labyrinth that is resulting from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed yesterday out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, at least, not withdraw his demand for new elections at the planned date, on 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its climax tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes for employment promotion, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax restraint are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism, which has to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not approve a commitment declaration on the fulfilment of savings measures.
However, the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, confirmed yesterday that its demand would not be disturbed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties would sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would come back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government, "which is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee still has for a while.
Queen Sophia: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of small-scale finances worldwide".
Queen Sofia of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has developed worldwide as a second donor for this means of international cooperation. The "Wesen" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind on the basis of confidence in humans".
The Queen was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" in order to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with income from less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "armout limit".
Spain continues to work on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world, and it is responsible to carry out this task," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit that lasts until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiary of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "confronted many challenges."
The Summit on Small Credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen declared that it was aimed for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
The conception of small credits is back in Spain and the rest of the world on the way "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as a "awesome idealist who has described herself to fight poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the local loan strategy.
One year later, this experience followed the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We could all see a continuous development," the Queen whose commitment to this project gave her the assessment as "Family Head" in Valladolid and as "President of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it is a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic trees, because it is a "continuous commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small credits are a "ernst and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states should now "more than ever" work in accordance with solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, small loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, proclaimed "the success", "marginalized" people, "standing always in front of closed doors" "hopping" and opening up the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city that was "the gates of their solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats Congress (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, left for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it has been implemented in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on the Greeks today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency, proposed by the Bureau, was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstentions.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which, due to their interventions at first, was Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schüble, had no doubt of the three European Ministers of Finance.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the requests, is the following: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace but also "no million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a strengthening of the control of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, as well as by the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote in order to give Europe a face.
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stated Wolfgang Schüble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates have rejected the proposal of weighting of each country in the Governing Board according to the weighting of the individual economics, which obviously would have to be an inherent increase in the position of Germany.
Thus, the Chancellor, who was considering the calmness of the climate within her party, has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her convention at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in trouble which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does the fraud represent in case of illness reports?
Following family support, the UMP and the government are now taking on the illness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, in order to visit a family aid box and present a talk about the issue of social fraud and economic dependency that has been issued since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the struggle to undergo the economy in a hard test, but not less prejudice to a right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on job disease reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government shows the introduction of a fourth day of care before taking into account a report of illness to workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a ill worker would lose the wage of four days without the approval of the specific company, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to combat anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", would, however, help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic character associated with another measure: to grant the officials an incompensated carence day in the case of disease (to date, in contrast to the three carence days in the private sector, there is no karency deadline).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also develops fraud topics, aiming at the abuse associated with work abuse.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and they are also refunded when this is required," warned Xavier Berand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the fields of illness reports seem a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been subject to permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives who have produced most frequent fruit.
The French are not more frequently ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all, let us stay with the country-wide numbers.
According to CNAM, over 237 million euros were paid daily in 2006.
Measures from the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health in 2008 represented 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% in maternity leaves, work accidents and 54% in the case of disease leaves, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, only 14.5 days of illness were granted to the French compared to the 17.8 days of 2009.
A medium value that distinguishes certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40 000 surveyed French workers did not have a single day of sickness.
Another study this time covered by health insurance reveals that 37% of the illness reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, therefore, the French workers tend no more than elsewhere to inability to work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (causal or otherwise justified) was oscillated in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of illness reports represents a disappearingly small proportion of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, there is only a weak challenge.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systmatic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285 000 realized short-term illness reports, which were in 37.050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematicly controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted to "unjustified or unjustified" cases, which represented 132.000.
In total, this makes 169 000 "unjustified" cases of several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A number representing only a weak exam compared to those of black work.
According to the UMP delegation, Dominique Tian, the author of a particular report on this issue in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros a year of tax loss, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This had been announced on Monday, on 14 November, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, in addition to the fact that the government of the Union had not given a hundred days to do this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budgetary adaptation programme," explained the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence voting on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Summit on 27 October was the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area was at stake, as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit by 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and in 2009 at 15.7%.
The rights reject the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, Chief of the Right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but foreseen that his party would not accept any additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his Party of Members, "New Democracy.
He had declared himself ready with the requirements of reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as in the fight against waste, but any policy that would interfere with economic recovery was opposing.
Olli Rehn, in charge of economic and monetary tasks, EU Commissioner who had prevented IMF and the EU from releaseing the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without written warranty of all parties on their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had answered that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure of Auβen.
Euthanation and accompanying free death must be legalised, according to an expert organisation
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The body explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated in the field of painful treatment to provide the best painful agents, and this is beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually invited to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report from the Canadian Royal Society, in which six experts were involved, which are linked to each other in various fields of specialism, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government change the penalty law in such a way to allow accompanied suicide and Euthanation where this choice takes place, for patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a start, experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the death quality in 40 countries of the earthball.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to crop the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painful drugs, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
From all over the country, the rate of 86% of deaths encountered in the hospital is the highest in Quebec.
In the narrow question of Euthania and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already accorded, to make no amendments to the criminal law on Euthania and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach Euthanation and accompanied suicide has legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would draw misconducts in their application, i.e. the practice of Euthania or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or unacceptable persons.
On the contrary, there are considerably more cases of such infringements just in the countries where Euthanation and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, the co-signator of the report, confirmed yesterday at a telecommunications conference.
"Euthanation is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanying suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian supports Euthanation
Consider that, according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already rejected in favour of Euthanation, since they believe that these allow people to relieve their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact that a legalisation of the Euthanation does not lead to the message that the life of older or disabled people was less valued.
As regards those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents argued 41% that they should not be criminally persecuted.
As regards maintaining or setting up the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also point out in their Recommendation List that the penalty law should state that the discontinuation of the funds for which a legal rejection has been made should not be considered a criminal.
The experts' body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the discontinuation of funds at the end of life and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The body explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painful treatment to provide the best painful agents, and this is beyond the cancer cases.
Lastly, as regards the resources used in the Canadian healthcare institutions in far-reaching ways to reduce pain or elimination of life requires the Agency to consider them at least, as they have not served to reduce physical pain as well as the Euthanation and to address the same procedures.
Other experts' reservations
Some experts in the field of health have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the Canadian Royal Society expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the attitude of the report-signing experts, among other things, "extreme", since they do not set any limits to the Euthanation Practice of Sickness in the final phase.
"This opens the doors for a situation where everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who saw a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sector of the society.
Well, he says, there would be "guides and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanation Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthania and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw from power
Damascus pranges a Complot
Syria is seen isolated
The Bashar al-Assads were demonstrating before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia and a "complot" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, have taken a position in favour of a departure from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. Of Jordan was yesterday the official Arab Prime Minister, who had invited President Bachar al-Assad to do so," lay down his official power in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of governmental power were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country, he would defeat, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of the political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Head of Diplomatics Ahmet Davutoglu had complained, on his part, that the Turkish intermediary attempts that have been addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been successful.
"The ones in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy this must go," he explained in announcement to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily roaring position.
On the other hand, the United States welcomed the "sharping of consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab Liga and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, Arab Liga and countries like Turkey have hit an ever sharper tone in view of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During that time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the governmental power in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had been killed in the besieged city of Hom's inhabited by "shots and heavy bombing attacks around Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Auβen trade, Walid al-Muallim, was still of the opinion that the country was "going to the end of the crisis".
By the way, he stressed the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which represents his assessment after a "hazardous step".
Syria "were not surrendered," he added under the control, "the conspiracies that were slaughtered against Syria would fail."
Following Syria's suspendation decision, the Arab Liga is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers into the country.
The French Minister for Auβen Trade Alain Juppé had also spoken for the dispatch of UN observers, in order to protect civilians from the repressions of the regime, that he was encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
An auβerplanming re-member of the Liga is planned for tomorrow in discount to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November for a rise in crisis, but in particular the controversial, predicted deduction of military troops from the inhabited cities, as well as the release of demonstrators in prison.
The Russian Auβen Minister Sergej Lawrow considered the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "incorrect" to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to offer sacrifices
Mario Monti, future Italian government leader, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that demands "sacrifice" to recover the creditworthiness lost in the last months of Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to call up a cabinet in Parliament that consists relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller, participating parliamentary groups after meeting the President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had been waiting for Mario Monti to put a confidence voting to Parliament until Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be held in the presentation presented by M. Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly be enough from a dozen ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in the markets of stock exchanges and obligations demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it would be "safe that the markets will be dual and understandable".
His order by the President was welcomed at the beginning of the markets, but the disturbance had again increased, especially after an unexpected decrease in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office of the Premier was to set up a staff of mainly technocrates, although he had emphasized that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's trust certificate until Friday.
M. Monti has undertaken to work in the sense of the aim of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe since he took up his role.
A speaker of Commissioner Olli Rehn underlined that "our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change even with regard to the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budgetary compensation in 2013 despite the saving plans taken over these last months, has in particular requested new challenges.
Emma Marcegaglia "Chef of the Chiefs" of Italy, which will meet on Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for economic incentives" which is a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit identification numbers."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "epoche change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of confidentiality" and a "other Italy", says the main article authors.
The largest unknown is the long-standing life of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, since Italy has arrived for 200 billion euros of government bonds from April 2012.
Russian scientists assist the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Whitscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a bomb capsule used with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS bases the result on the recent report published by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents published by this UN Agency for the detection of this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had notified its "reasonable concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, appeared to have been working in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s, and was involved in the synthetic diamond production produced by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev that creates "Nano-diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he then contributed to an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only in this technology but also, as an official of the Agency announced, has worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islam crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes have either decreased slightly or have only increased in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas 13% of violence against Catholics, 4% decline in criminal crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes had been observed.
The total number of "hass motivated crimes" has increased in very weak Maβe to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of criminal crime, as the FBI says.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights Organization of Human Rights first underlined."The increase in anti-Islam violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a Communication.
"Human Rights First had long underlined that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious legal constitution against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a representative of the organization.
"The U.S. Government can and should do more to combat these crimes," he added, assuming that this could be done by improving the police attitude toward the "hass crime".
The "hass crime" represents in American federal law as an inheritance from the epoch of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion, or descendant, and now also involve crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter walks the platform and is more and more like Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in order to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enables better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages are tracked and tracked by your messages.
This makes it possible to determine whether these allow them to track their messages, subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested with a small percentage of users before its general internet distribution on Monday" in August", explained Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, equipped with some esotherically stimulating words (RT for the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des Initiatives, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec and maniement plus comparable a celui desréseaux grand Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet using certain "Tweets".
"This is useless, urgent and too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "Activity" will help me to track certain elements of my flux-twitters better," explained @dannykron stream.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of a "Golden Budget Rule"
The government of the large social democratic/Christian coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficiencies and also avoid any degradation since rating agencies in Austria's Top Bonity (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public government debt is 74.6%, that is, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity had not decreased to a stroke of AAA+ to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros additional interests each year," Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Canzler and Christian Democratic Auβen Minister argued.
Austria also takes place a request from the Brussels summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: Heads of State and Government would have demanded that public deficit be reduced by the end of 2012 and return to public account balance into the Constitution or by adopting a equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had incorporated such a "regulation" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, from 2017 the Structural Budget Deficit of the State should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while regional states should have balanced households as well as the communities.
The aim is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement at the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that, if the Yen should continue to rise, Japanese official power would intervene again on the monetary markets.
"If we discover an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the Yen, we will intervene as we did the last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was near the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo had sold massive yen to dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is in charge of a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has increased regularly about it, baptized by purchases of investors who view the yen as the "refuge value" in these uncertain times of world economy defence and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was cast under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded about 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese devis damages the exports of the archipelago, since it devours the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami that destroyed the region of Tohoku (Northern East) on 11 March for its reconstruction," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this explosion of the yen can kill the weak increase already in the room.
The third economic world power, with the growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time in this year, has reappeared by the jumping export increases and the consumption of the "plombed" households.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the expansion of the Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
The financial minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all the reasonable measures to defend the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has notified, however, that the BoJ has already initiated "approved measures" and that he can read that no additional currency locking could be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the note bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (EUR 47 billion) in order to abolish the 55.000 billion Yen (EUR 519 billion) coverage amounts which it had used for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest foot faster to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawers
The inflammatory risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine the European identification numbers.
Despite the official position of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also run a little more on Tuesday, on 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 1.4% at 10 o'clock and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding the yields of government bonds in the euro area in difficulties, the global share markets continue to spend some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are conscious of the inflammatory risk," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which suffers from the new fear of the market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, has closed with a bazzle of 0.7%.
""Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitschushige Akino, Fondsmanager bei Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurrection of concern about the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10:00 p.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange makers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the assembly on Monday, had made an application which in particular provides for the possibility of countries in trouble to get out of the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The loan rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, whose Spanish titles grew up to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the Southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian government leader Mario Monti called on more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by lambing by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October of the Eurozone was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, as the elections of Parliament will take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest sharing ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new historical high.
Expecting the growth rates of the euro area
Statistically, France booked a economic growth of 0.4% by budget consumption in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the baisses of the numbers of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbed by economic experts.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first calculation of the whole euro area is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogs
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchase power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to start, consider this topic and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruit if it separates the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is dubbing the demand for electricity by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not be dismissed from a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be reduced in order to continue to produce electricity without the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, to be forgotten to combat climatic irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to abstain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision on the need to find a substitutable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intending to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only some countries, continue to pursue their projects with decisiveness.
The United States, on their part, decided after Fukushima to join their park another unit by restarting the work of the Three Mile Island, which was discontinued after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is oriented to renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, however, the reality is contrary to the discurs.
The Berlin election will be in the form of a dilution of the electricity price, an increase in energy dependency, in particular in Russia, which is an increase in the CO2 emissions caused by gas and carbon plants.
The total amount of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European table leader in wind energy, from which it relates to 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternatingly used with wind energy; because of this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account, unlike our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability of industry on national ground, the French companies have an advantage because of the most affordable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Investigations showed that this is a price that the large majority of the French are just as little ready to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Consider that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 inducing jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a variety of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them create untalking jobs.
If France decides to get out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victimed, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly shrinking.
If the decline of its producer is preprogrammed, what electrician would be an EPR designed to work for 60 years?
To solve the energetic equation, you must acknowledge that there is as little a miracle for the production of electricity as well as a devil work.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear and renewable energy developed by the Areva company demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the maximum level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority conducting compromiseless and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction of Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made their names because of their professionality, have just been occupied by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disorders.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so he passed without consequences for human and environmental.
In Tschernobyl the drama was raised by reactor construction and indebted human failure.
At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters that never existed, which caused the death of several tens of thousand people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previouss.
As the fruit of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which allows him to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant among the electrical technicians, a construction stop in Flamanville would be an amazing gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading free railways to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to search for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogs and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that is equally determined by the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - the overload of police, courts and administrative bodies due to a policy underlying the numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself named.
Recently, the disturbance against foreign students by the authorities had characterized the weekly views, the Minister of Interior had declared (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needed no talents, Maurer or Kellner from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
In fact, there is a widespread consensus between the right and the left on this subject.
From the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, which in 1976 had explained that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigration workers, would not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, could not "take up France's entire poverty in the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of large movement
The fear of the invasion of the national soil was divided both from the right and from the left in 2005.
From both camps, immigrants were seen as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of large movement that is to be admitted to immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited to banalities in his programme, pointing out that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically expensive.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recently published work summarying the latest findings about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 s.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive influence of the immigration flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigrant countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to substitute local workers, especially those less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are truly more complementary than local wage workers, since they are exercising major jobs in sectors that are technically unexhausted.
The low qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers travel little, more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not in line with the labour offer.
Positive wage effect
Similarly, as a surgeon would have difficulties in working in a country in which there is a lack of anaesthesiasts, this complementarity also results in a positive effect of migrants' access to wages and national labour market situations.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration leads to an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of inspiration and economic growth brought by immigrants is comparable (higher share of indigenous immigrants among American nobel prizeholders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute netly to social systems, in European countries, at an average of approximately 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, at the age of 30 years after Germany, an immigration person spends an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of about EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring the missing cutpoints with the teeth to his mandate.
However, these declared teeth, which should disturb the immigrants, achieved the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remaining to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had overtaken the whole 20th century on the tragedy of the First World War, totalitarism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was enough to exercise the right of vote, in the best possible way to overcome democracy once and for all over their enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general rule law, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this purpose and can be as good as the "depression instrument", as it was expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social spirit, a legal procedure.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is a economic crisis, but it is as much as the first of all political and democratic crisis.
The change in mind of the Greek true-false referendum would have had a double insightful character in this respect: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also for those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered exhausted.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have changed today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer targeting in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to press on the success of the national referendum, which was organized in dependent on the needs and in wrong order.
A freeschein for the European sole ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the empty of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, full-righted, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and it exists in Europe.
It is Europe all over which the dictatorship of the markets and the rating agencies suffers under its absence and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are worried about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give back the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
For it is the whole thing that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The departure from the crisis has decisions at European level, which cannot be made without total democratic law without destruction.
After this proposal has been combated by Jacques Delors and the socialists for a long time, everyone is urging the European economic leadership today.
I agree.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they suggest to the citizens - this would be a new foolishness and another sack gas.
We need to take a new stage of European development.
In order to make the Republic emerge in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of the interests alone could not afford enough here.
This teaching continues to be valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards will be for general good
The world fair for chip cards opens their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most carrying segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or compensation of purchases by simply keeping the map to a reader.
More than the 320 million sold a year before this year, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins on ground with regard to the non-contact payment after it has been dependent for a long time in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75.000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have undertaken to provide their customers systematically with bank cards provided with contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test Payment by phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to future payments: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for these transactions.
"They've been in delay."
"But they should at least experience a real upward development next year."
"We expect sales of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will expire from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are intended to be equipped with a capsule allowing the contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Genérale had also stated yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer that allows their customers to pay contactlessly by phone.
Terrorist front understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sect Boko Haram.
The long suspected relationships between the al-Qaida group of terrorists in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβen minister of Abdelram Messahel himself confirmed that algier had now gained certainty about it.
"The way both organisations act and the relationships of secret services indicate a clear collaboration," he explained without delay.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French in the Niger last January have promoted interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey, were supposed to have been killed on the following days at the same time as several of their kidnappers at the time of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian detectives want to find several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the ruins at the site of use.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the leading telephone calls leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the detectives are particularly interested in the numbers of two partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who held the Wage of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is regarded as the Aqmi and the Sect.
"This is a progress, but there is no doubt a need to wait for clearer evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's thoughtable."
"For years it has been known that the secree refers to financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that it is increasingly active," rejects Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months, these "support services" have become more and more visible in their course, as well as the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start with Washington, has since then exercised pressure on Abuja in order to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have for a long time regarded the grouping as a Community of Illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which in Haoussa means as much as "Western Education is a shame" follows the creation of a Islamic Emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger experiences rapid success.
She politiciates and claims strict compliance with the Shariah, while its shared activists are engaging in the fight against the wicked central government.
At first, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in vision.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is differentiated as usual.
The army is surrounded by the city, and it's 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf captive is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its highburgs in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to a suicide in Jos, which demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide assassination that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations serves as a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has worried all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned against Boko Harem and showed himself willingly "to communicate all the indications".
The world of the Republican Presidency candidates
In the midst of Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and inconsistency with regard to China, Iraq, as well as the assistance position for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America lead a complex world with simple not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate in this way, the voters could get almost this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have made their thundering statements and their statements on the Auβen policy, traditional republic focus repeatedly clear.
Through China, Iran and the Israeli aid - often in no way understood - slogans.
With regard to the appointing of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest in the course, Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to quote before the WTO and to view them as the leading theme in America, which is irritated by the migration of all industrial branches to Asia.
You're stupid if this is to imply the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβen politics, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions of smedeful gestures.
He had called for a convenient but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (as well as the current position of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not answered because he stagnates in the deep of the opinion surveys.
Reagan's Similar Image
Romney had also commended military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm condemning Iran," he had condemned.
"When Obama is reelected, they will get the bomb."
In addition, he promised that Israel would have increased military assistance and accused Obama of being guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest placed candidate, has a disgraceful documentary knowledge on his part.
Recently, he called to give the Chinese military threat contra, as Beijing's attempt to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be considerable that China has been possessing military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Mexican governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is prepared to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The reaction to torture against mutual terrorists by Obama in 2009 was also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitical weight.
The current presidential contradictors, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They rightly persevere on the failure of his naive talk with Iran, the prompt abduction of his "Jungs" from Iraq, his unconsciousness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enmity is not so untrusted.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has disabled.
Since Iraq, it has been protecting against military interventions that lead to the acceptance.
And Obama is more convinced by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to raise his leadership to a new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the sea ground of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly to Russia, has been launched.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to conduct this event with glory and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, lived last Tuesday on the East Sea coast under orchestra shale and at fine taste buffet the introduction of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically rotated the tax of the valve, which transportes the Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is intended to deliver 27,5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km length, which connects the region of Sankt Petersburg with Mecklenburg prepommers to West Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line climb on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction is like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any traffic through third countries (Polen or Ukraine) on the road.
That is why these two countries lose a little power: it will now be more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, had not been rejected before comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is very sensitive politically.
West Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This is, however, at the expense of decommissioning European energy, as the project has made a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy western countries, who have strong gas consumption and whose gases are inclined.
"This gas transmission is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon in the introduction of the gas transmission by pointing out in what degree the large gas contracts are important from political and economic aspects.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin as regards the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with beto-name anchorages to protect it from anchors of ships.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m depth.
During their construction, mining fields that dated from World War II had to be removed.
"One hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed by caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman of the Society Nord Stream.
In addition, enhanced measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake of metal, heavy like 242 oak towers that have been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden’s coast, but the project responsibles have taken away from it, since Sweden had little desire to see a Russian state society permanently settle on their coasts.
"In the case of a havaria, we will close the gas through in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipe is evaporated into the air.
However, this case is regarded by the constructors as little likely, since the sweats were estimated to be resistant by a leak per 100 000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline shall be ensured by a sub-water robot which is controlled for external observation purposes by a sea ship, as well as by a device circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigarette, measures a meter diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moves through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of continuation through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without having to undergo only the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the accession, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are divided (from 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (from 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called North Stream which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on the renewable Twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, regardless of the size of the actual transported gas quantity," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to recover their explanations, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas pipe comes on a sandy coastal beach with jaws at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4,5 meters high valves form the gas outlet pounds.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per last hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a notebook.
From an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventures, on candle cards with the letter.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily detectable again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the ovarian sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to market a distinct design note book at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert advisor of the company, is commissioned to introduce the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient manufacturing technique called Mole Skin (Mulwurfshaut), which is a cotton bag, for example, used for polster benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has relived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered to be icons of avantgardist artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible at Modo Modo.
The success will take place.
From 2006 to 2010 sales rise by 26% and are established by a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine happens to the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantasy picture of the buyers, as the notebook is enthusiastic for businessmen as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which was 12 employees at its start, has now been employing over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in book deals, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands to implement its identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and its new write need, which exists despite the uptake of the emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (omweg)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also placed a band with leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural time spirit and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand shows the whole bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings Neider on the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, which is now the Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why remains the unemployment rate of disabled workers at this high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" starts.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% versus 9% of the total population.
Disappointing?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, aligning the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress achieved within 15 years is considerable."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nottheless, there's still a huge deal to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
More frequently, the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no abiture and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher graduation.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make jobs more difficult and which are the "care of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much to the casey brakes.
Stay the unpronounced, the mental attitudes that, though certain, continue to develop slowly.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS entrepreneurs for La Cité magazine suggested that the managers in question have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minor funds".
The result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a wide way to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
These latter figures originating in 2008 refer to a quote of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for entering contributions from companies who disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "payment fees" of business places has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011.
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge in particular among the large companies."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees 82%.
Hazard:"What a luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Servants (20:45) the foreheads, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too wide-ranging to claim that there was a secret consensus between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
On the side of the audience stage of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been able to conclude peace.
Five months after the temperate gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise regarding his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the borrowed lizard on his side.
As regards the contrast between his presentation in club and national elf, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Little I'm over the whole year what is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, introduced Friday evening against Romania as regards the match against France, in order to finally shine.
However, without leaving the note of the "pleasury".
He launched the French national team since the age of 7 years, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This, unfortunately, contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he advocates.
"We just walked over the way."
"To allow them to play means great happiness!"
Leekens read his side with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride to carry out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its characteristic as "Nachbarn" - that France has again become a team at very high level," and that is little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did fucking good work," he said enthusiastic.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the technician is very well looking to share the plane with the blues (the French National Elf) ... toward Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the forthcoming games." The game against France will be included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, looks forward to replay against Bosnia (22:00 a.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the time of the replay, both teams had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy crew and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no smallest approach to doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this actually means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the replay (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour clearly, but the team was unable to press the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we haven't achieved any foreignstore."
At home, however, in their brightly bright towns of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they should be in the face of a audience, which might be equally hot to the game, even though the party of course was announced as "very close", said the optimist but clear Bento.
"We expect a very narrow match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50%-like chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
On Friday, in Bosnia, the Portuguese forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
The Bosnians who also need a gate can already have enough.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, as we haven't achieved any foreignstore," Bento regrets.
"We will join a team that has high technical quality and has players with many individual qualitys," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had prejudiced to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "no time to think"."
A good idea, under the condition that it is implemented this time.
