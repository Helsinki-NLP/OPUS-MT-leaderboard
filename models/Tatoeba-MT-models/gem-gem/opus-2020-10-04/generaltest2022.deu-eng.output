The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# Großkunde and therefore it is no problem for me.
Need only a number or instructions that I should attach to the package so that it can be tricked by you as a retour.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
In fact, I think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re order for the better price or is there another way of credit?
In principle, I also believe that you should not accept children to take over a parent role for your little siblings.
However, I think it's good for great siblings to take care of the little ones in a manner.
Let's see a little, let's help, bring the bottle, etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child, I can see no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can even best measure if this fits for your children.
It's not the case that he's supposed to wear K2 and accompany him for hours in sleep.
Just legally, it's probably questionable.
Therefore, perhaps the statement of psychologists is also coming.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to care for K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter, of course is your estimate ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a criminal / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action, but the title partout doesn't mind me any more maybe someone knows here...
The story was of fear and to therape them.
At the beginning of history a veterinarian commits suicide by throwing himself over with feed and going to his robbery cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapeuts, operates a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (fore fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who will be commissioned anonymously before every suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any event, it appears that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately put its anxiety in the extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intention of death)
This is what the book calls "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the hospital that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even could betray me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for Wlan available.
You have to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to do afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference rejected ?
Child, 4 J., splits under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has all the length of wood fragments under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a penetrate.
It's very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it's going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to advance re-suspension
Always get new Omikron cases politics and science in the United Kingdom.
So until New Year, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccine offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster in the Corona refreshing vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than so far.
Every adult in England had to be given the opportunity to receive a Booster dosage by the end of the year, provided that the second vaccination has passed at least three months, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a previously recorded video message to his countrymen.
The target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one is faced with an emergency, and therefore it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Get up!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, with a total of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Is the full amount refunded by the purchase price at collection?
I am for all to present themselves with pronomics
I sent out an application.
Today, the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner, and I will not keep any official over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine pronomics.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only the one I bought today isn't going
Apparently, the chair had an unvisible deficiency in sales.
How can such a polster damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only try on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since about.
No more than 14 days.
Therefore, I always bought the last books via the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and take account of it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something detailed here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more often in contact with the victims (and transgressors) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nights to me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims are not being helped or we think we can't help them.
I realize that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are less things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the killer far out of sight and hearing range, I can't reach all.
I don't know why, maybe it's fear of fear of revenge to leave the usual social environment, fear of removing the children from this.
What I always want to make everyone clear is, partly even very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you're worth living without violence, that's so incredible important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series mean "League of Legends"?

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei der Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster John Patrick was trusted.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said, with a look back at the Pokal Degradation early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, "We have some anger in the stomach."
It has then not been laying after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) downlay in the basketball bundesliga.
In which more than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
Substitute is called a statistics that expresses the entire dilemma: The threeer quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (total of the young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 trials - still questions?
The answer delivered John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
His counterpart reacted to Sebastian Glim: "To win a gigantic game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were authorised in Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best game maker I've ever trained," still praised Glim.
While in Patrick's team itself the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel and came up to eight points after they had already retired 39:59.
Besides John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19cm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
We had a different mail address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I've already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and we have rewrited them for that reason.

Ever peeled from the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to enthusiastic his audience with new interpretations of battles from the 20s and 30s.
At present, he is on the way with the program "Good Day, dear luck" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing to do with it.
The planned concert has been moved in May 2022 - "on official instruction" to prevent the Corona virus.
Other of the events planned in the Advent time must also be done as it is called on the website of the singer, who becomes today 59, and its musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January the artists then want to pick up their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and love as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with Commilitons.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its stock of battles and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of charts.
He made it out of the nice in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, strictly retarded the blond hair and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking away from the current German-speaking musical landscape.
With the program "Good Day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: Exemption does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the withdrawal of large housing companies, as was demanded in a national decision in Berlin.
"With an exception, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give renters security that their rents will remain payable in the next few years.
A mix of for example private tenants, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Green and Left Party wants to use an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the people's decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude conversations with the FDP in the Ampel Coalition on further reinforcements in the rent law.
The coalition contract provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of lease increases in tensioned housing markets and the extension of the lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rent market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been pulled through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead to complain.
The pictures from there remind me of a war area.
In the night on Saturday, in the United States, several Tornados have caused serious destruction and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320 kilometres long snow of destruction, especially in the member state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was broken, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial installations, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred dead in the member state of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise every hour.

Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government further rejects the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans into vaccination calls, according to the German model, is also intended to increase the willingness to vaccinate Corona.

And that he didn't like you at that time, no matter what.

Please take the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Assistance with the first own campaign
Boron to the crush!
I'm just leading the adventure about the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends, and I want to lead my heroes in a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The large arc is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual file designed and now I am in writing the entrance adventure and pillowing on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a ferry with cereals from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is intended to develop the further action.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to lean up a group of goblins and lure them into a restraint.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threats, know the danger early, whatever the players are.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sails
In the absence of notice, the goblins lean up the heroes in a holeway and flank to each three left and right of me, bows armed the ferry while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to fight and the heroes are understood, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all found and cured by the son of the village school, a half eleven.
The car is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be indefinite, just this half-eleven with two of his servants, and come to help the hero in the battle.
The car is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you hold Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entrance to adventure too much?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so not only canon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee to follow many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrational.
I built the lamp again.
And back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can let the backlight come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am crushed by Sky Sport F1
Hello, F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German sky has increased, so I want to get some air with this post.
First once today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transfer was cancelled in order to start the F1 pre-report.
Although the delayed start and the start accident of the schedule were far behind planning, one could still have shown the last 10 minutes (planned) and the mastership decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has the priority and therefore has to limit everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially as Sky UK transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little commendation: the commentator Olivier Blackyes has well accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident.
Then, in the F1, there was rule uncertainty again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you could switch the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both concluded that steps may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio speeches on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for stepping.
I believe that such elementary rules should be easily known if you comment on the F1 at a Pay TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or required according to rules, both have just constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally not liked with the artified comment style of Rose, but admit that the taste is a matter of taste.
But there I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
This includes constant alfreds that make both simply unprofessional, like ordering coffee at (also unquestionable) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of disturbance into the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, where Sky is the only broadcaster who goes to the advertising, how to listen to F1TV, because only the German sound track has to come out without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two channels in the training also make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to commend Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 program is also very narrow and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unironic makes RTL a better job at the four races that they can still transfer to advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To this: #PRS_ORG# pencil light, measuring and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing.
The first lady told me that it's sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she'll check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the substance has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Lifter pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium additionally with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants.
If you have a large aquarium, you can fit pumps with two or more exits to join more flowers.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model fan pumps, but also offers to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air cover (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubble into a function.
Here would be a treasure, mushroom or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-depressed design and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The ventilator pump is connected 4/6 mm to an auströmer, etc....and it can already be started.
The ventilator pump should be equal, or higher than the water level, and should be applied outside.
If the ventilator pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a backward valve between it.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve between it.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is fitted outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as other pumps do.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Although we here in ebay indicate the processing time of 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also downloaded daily here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is disputed, just because it took a little longer.
Well, it wouldn't be that everyone understands all the employees who work in the speditions as well... of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate as badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively on the package services.
Of course, you like to blame these services, even if we're saying at the moment, they're having it fucking hard
This is also very different regionally.
If you don't be evil, stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you order your legs in bright, too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and modern to the world room
The daughter of the first U.S. American in All, a TV-moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten minutes flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Bezos took the freshly crushed astronauts at the very personal time after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronaut, fled into the All (1923-1998), after which the rocket system of Blue Origin was named, and the 50-year-old TV-moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company who had paid other four passengers for their tickets: Dilan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology business Lane Bess and its son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin didn't communicate.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard with his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just so caught, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also exclaimed enthusiasticly.
He would prefer to return to the All again, said the moderner.
"New Shepard" flys to 100 kilometres height
The "New Shepard" missile system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the missile reached a height of about 100 kilometres across the earth, sometimes with gravitylessness before the re-useable object landed back from large fallscreens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres across the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-maned trip from Blue Origin: On the first time in July, the Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner, who was known with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice-president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critikers propose Bezos and Blue Origin to advance business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the welfare of mankind and without consideration for the climate.

Someone who works in the biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not disturb me (already have the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
I have, of course, already informed myself about professional prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I would surely want to study and become until promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing my occupational prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear always super occupational opportunities and the profession is totally searched, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and unbelievably poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What have you studied/what training have you done?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really insecure at the moment and I think I might stop studying in 2022 and make a training a specialist informant.
If you have experience there, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's just now that it's a pussy.
Not only before large holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there's also the one before holidays plus bridge days.
Because it was so: last week Mariä was the sky tour, which is called "upcoming" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day week end in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails that have to go out before rise, order here, everything *without prejudice* before the long weekend.
'Cause... 'cause?
Because "Next Week Then" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people all seriously want to do as much in a short week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday but also powerfully nervous.
What's this self-catering for holidays?
What do we have holidays for if we are not allowed to do it properly?!
Stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent of it.
My question is simple, are we the only, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in their Thüringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by backing with her son's place and basteling.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But up to the sensible days, she has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to end now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth cycle of mice and feather rehabilitation.
NECTON bio contains all vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and bright feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in birdkeeping shall be due solely to dietary errors.
Since the feather consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is required for the forming of a clean feather cloth.
For a working metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mice are based on lacking or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedingstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamins should be administered during use of NEKTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handworks model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, which is probably a very rare Lok from the rebuilding proposal of the model railwayer ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and errors see photos, function good, The construction series E 95 is a heavy freight electrocomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal tank trains in the Schlesian network, which may also come from the small series company ZSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Sales) and we are operated
The German Reichsbahn Society had in 1924 commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electrolokomotive that should be able to transport 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of personnel at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with a tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Shockerwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives received operating numbers E 95 01-06 were delivered.
Everyone survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came to the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Richbahnenverbesserungswerk Dessau the recycling value of all six locomotives was detected.
[4] As progressive reelectrification of the medium-German network resulted in an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were established in 1959 and the remaining machines served as a spare part donor.
First, the larger numbers E04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred.
Only when the E 94 was expected that the upgrading number could not be further increased, the E 95 went to the point of processing.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before carbon trains from the hostage valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved.
Thus it was often that a shooter remained sticking in circuit operations.
Then the perpetrator on this locomotive had to resolve the shooter during the ride.
Injury to the drivers occurred more often and led to monthly failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since the end of the 1960s were sufficiently new building locomotives and there was no significant expansion of the electrical operation at that time, the railway could abstain from old locomotives and most splitting holes, so that the E 95 was exposed to service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupie electrolokomotives only in a single manner, which, due to the above difficulties with the machines and the visional conditions of the leadership would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were posted in mid-1969, they last followed the E 95 01, which discontinued the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
Up to the E 95 02, all locomotives were broken.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at the main station Halle.
It took a while to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was retainable as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external design of the locomotive started to present it to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since been a member of Dresden Transport Museum as an unoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
In the DB Museum Hall (Sale) the Lokomotive museum is managed.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Hall P traditional community have been working on the operational design of the Lokomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive could be presented for the first time for an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external lacture, with the transformers checked and five drivers are able to operate.
-The Lokomotives were on the Schlesian mountain railway until 1945 and the deviating sideways in operation, where they proved to be good because of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were resettled to Leipzig to the Middle German network.
The main operation area was first Slesia
Handworks model H0 in OVP, function well, it is optical afterwork on the Lok in own work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- possibly is also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. sad are these too smal and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately they are malproduced.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'm getting new mails.
When are they sent off?
No, no, no, no, no.
That's, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfil their objectives
They're not flat with me
Can I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people have been easily injured at a fire in a house in Upper Bayers.
In addition, a estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has been caused, as the police informed on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the nearby residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two inhabitants were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact fire cause was not known at first, but the police did not go out of deliberate fireworks.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it'll come a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To defend fake-News - Biontech-CEO published Impact Photo
Uğur şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021.
Biontech-Chef Uğur şahin had not yet expressed public opinion on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The disease of a friend moved him to do so, informed ʼahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, have published a photo that shows how he receives an vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media there were wrong information that I said I was not vaccinated.
Actually, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Çahin on Friday in a contribution on the LinkedIn network.
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory device for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, Çahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear that is often swollen by misinformation and distrust."
Fear should be hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experience.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave circulates, where Uğur şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German Wave himself clarified.
"I am now legally not allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Çahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccination.
The priority has now been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech Chef has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in surfing system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had laminated a respanne station.
After a fire with severe damages in a space station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine victory circuit in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to get out for about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening the fire made lights for 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants affected in several communities.
The carrier Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency aggregates had been in operation until the massive disturbance could eventually be completely remedied at the late evening.
Firemen and assistants and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care facilities at schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the persons concerned for their patience and for the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the fire forces and the THW for the immature use,” said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology area, in a message on Saturday night.
The repair of damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet-Monteurs were only able to recruit some lines provisionally at first, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to corporate data.
Power flows again
The fire broken out on Friday at 7:15 p.m., according to the data of the Westnet at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid revolving station, has damaged parts of the 10,000 volt-saltan area.
There is a need for essential cleaning and repair work.
Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000 volt tension level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 18 a.m., more than 21,000 people had had power in Much and Ruppichteroth again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Ninekirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure had also been.
More than 80 West Network mountors and partner companies had been in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance.
"Now it is important for citizens to take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and to communicate to local firearm buildings when there is a need for help," stated the Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The inhabitants of Altenheimen were focused at the establishment and operation of emergency power aggregates.
Furthermore, according to public authorities, temporary care facilities were established in schools for those who were unable to care for themselves or the power-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them with you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy
But I can't mount this base on the table plate.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three statements.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't interfere with them and thus shorten them.
Can you continue to help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a return
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it!
You send me the return card by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before buying I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do that now?
I find this low credit almost uncomfortable.
We do not agree with that.

Have bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be malformed, they will report to the customer service.

I have to work in between too!
In order to make the colour supply even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, and dry the components with clear water.
Before bringing the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to the stroke.
Easy overlapping of color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid swimming quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark could appear later.
Metal tones and metal colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it may be uncomfortable metal sharing when mixing with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for one day before you grow them.
Original look reaches the models through the decals or detract images.
From high-speed marks on aircraft over ship names to car models and marks: The Decals give the model the last cut.
Bring the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well accessible.
A airplane cockpit can be attached or easier before it is built in the cup.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, pinsticks and dentists, are in time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal out individually and correct it to you.
Decals are also called water sheet images because you fluid their backside shortly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the nose.
Then you just push the image a little piece of the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moisturized before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you move it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick, knitt, or even knitt.
Suspend excess water with a household towel.
Respect not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly when I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I've read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
All right, thank you very much!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without any problem?
Child wish treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were a couple of times in child wish treatment, now when it comes to calculating with the car, it suddenly turns across.
The following row:
We had applied for the children's wishes in front of the car and received the assurance on 3 trials.
The experiments were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and we carried out two (successless) trials, but we did not expect them with the car yet.
We applied again for the cost acquisition of the car and received three further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more attempts than promised, logically, the most expensive with the car) we reached the bills at the car and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the car wants to refund only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/borne, the remaining 2 trials of the first commitment are expired.
The second wish for children is a new case of insurance.
However, according to the Terms of Conditions, "The case of insurance begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment needs are no longer available."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who here has the right to reimburse the car (only 3 trials) or we (it is 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Would the cars have had to point us out in the commitments that the further attempts would fall out with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (contingent by closed ovarians) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back the best
All right.
We won't order with them anymore.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), they obviously lost good customer.
They may like to forward this to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was caused and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything because the commode is completely disturbed at me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the refund has been caused and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have lost two ancestors now.
My friend also ordered various furniture over his account for our apartment.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as a office chair.
Independently, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, it is not possible for me to create another type of packaging.
I'll cut off the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hockers, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low-budget film is precisely, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find abundant lists of low-budget movies, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's upset with it?
And what do you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, has already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey Leadersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you need to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halb victory" against Belarus connected with high costs for the EU
The EU can, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, announce a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of migrants' rights and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation of Science and Policy (SWP).
This weakness - Belarus does not make a very small contribution, but the EU feels a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Cooperation with people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It is evident that there is a "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not decisively turn against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be possible if a Member State is in the head to do its thing," as is currently Poland, which does not allow Frontex to access the border even by the EU border protection agency.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, so Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy would be difficult, since the line "Grenzschutz, Border Protection, Border Protection" was strengthened.
Re-experienced cross-border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have again tried to get through Belarus in the Polish field.
55 migrants had been arrested on Sunday in the night and brought back to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been hosted with stones in the event near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was faced and had to be medical cared by a military physician.
Overall, border protection recorded 52 crossings attempted within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border blocks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko as the ruler in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to border sections, Poland and Lithuania, press reports were closed.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the country of origin in order to interrupt departure there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and proved its determination to operate with hard bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society does not think that the security device should regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests by the controversial formula-1 finale
Max Verstap is supposed to have committed two line breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - Based on the controversial Formula 1 Finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes objected.
The silver pills suspect as two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a suspected violation of Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have repeated regularly.
A second objection was made against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed by rules.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton had been overridden in Mercedes and had become his first Formula-1 title.
The manöver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Netherlands had overcrowded the car before it.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report again to you
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe-Park arranges SC-Freiburg-Fandag
The Europe-Park, the namegiver of the Europa-Park Stadion of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg fanday.
As the park notes, members and permanent card holders of the sports club from Breisgau and the fan community were allowed to visit the European Park freely this day.
In addition, there were goods for drinks and worsts.
The rear trains lighted this day through the tricots red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect scenes," said the park.
Already since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a collaboration between the Federal Ligist and the 40 kilometers north of Freiburg recreational park located in Rust.
The first SC Freiburg fanday in the European Park has shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing brilliant fans who have common fun in the backway confirm this," says Europe-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€ ?

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemit, that doesn't mean anything.
It's like if a divert says he doesn't have anything to do with foreigners.
Their i will not admit it both.
But colleague always reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to get distant, you should just let it be complete.
Yes, then, you're just as little serious as colleague.
Who is seriously questioning evolution is simply completely lost.
For my sake, a God has put the whole thing in place.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 100,000 years old and the science just disappears of nonsense.
And that's what you're a scientist and not to take seriously like colleague
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the magnitude should be closer to the eye as close as possible.
The special aplanatic achromatic-designed lens system allows you to use the magnitude of the magnitude to the edge zone without color.
Lupens are often marked with enlargement data.
However, these information shall apply only to specific conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnitude optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical appliances - also in the case of bumpers - light reflects.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceived.

I have already reported to you under the customer contact with number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was said before.

Retail sale in Beauwelde: In the municipality of Crembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such a curiose situation in the sale of tunas.
One time a man was supposed to have gone home even without his partner, because both couldn't agree.
Every year he plants about 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curiosis situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas a joke, he says.
What about the card?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain equality between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spit.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalence might be like the "Dreher", which does not sound so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network now.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit correctly up to a few failures.
The new fibre connector sends 500 Mbit to FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends out the wifi no longer reaches the full 500, but the more I get away from the house with the module, the less it comes (e.g. using a dossier that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This causes the Internet with the new fiber connection now at the first floor is even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that seems to use a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar major losses.
Can anyone explain why with glass fibres so much Internet speed goes through the power transmission "missed"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely urgent to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought that now was rest at the girocontents for the first time, looks deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free amounts for negative interest rates are also decreasing.
For example, the German Bank, with a limit of EUR 100,000, was considered relatively generous.
Now she just halfed the free amount and even quadrified for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Partee Postbank - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower amounts apply to the entire German Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already dropped to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is just popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts to two stages, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25.000 euros or less according to the numbers of the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000. However, there is still a legal controversy with consumer centres who have even been entitled in the first instance before the Berlin Landgericht against this scheme.
The banks are already discussed whether the institutions may be able to make recoveries - in the event that the upper instances also explain negative interest rates in principle for inappropriate and many millions to bank customers have to be paid back.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at Hollywood's top.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the U.S. Magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who made the "Friends" reunition and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" birds in 2021, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, styleists and trainers cares about their appearance.
Anyway, so Aniston, she will enjoy a chip on the day (yes, well read: an incense chip from the bag).
Yet that she is flying to the hearts of female and male fans likewise is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has trouble with luck - and still seeks the great love.
And the baby wish has deleted from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and glory will also make you happy.
Invaluable end of a career: Raikans must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from the formula 1 was even more silent than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and removed the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Réikönen had not even half of the Renndistanz to dispose of his Alfa Romeo at the high price of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the winning of the World Championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup - Nolte victories in Zweierbob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björnalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I figured that I had to go into nine and a half victory per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double olympian from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the winterberg races.
First on Saturday, he defended Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundred centuries, in which he drove from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and ran out a larger prescent on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he sat before the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have taken a greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
John Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to place two before this time on Rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Felnbach landed after Rank four in the first race on the place eight.
"If I knew what he's doing differently, I'd do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third season victory in the twoerbob on her homeway.
After it was only enough for the fourth place in the monobob in the morning, she rusted on Sunday at the German triple success with Anchor Deborah Levi to the World Cup.
Twoerbob Olympic Maríama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came to rank two with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first Podestplatz this winter next to her Olympia qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed on three places with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first pod place in the world cup, I'm super lucky that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were all right," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just an incidence, but there's also a huge deal to do about it."
Jamanka was a little anxious about the not completely flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't resolve why I finally asked.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it had gone out of me, which was very angry.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment started only on 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I tippe on it comes an extra field with the message
Your colleague was taken away yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered would be.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new uninjured
And don't cancel all the order.
Only this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write, and maybe it's going some - or others too...
I'm 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dogama - once except that my dog doesn't scream or go into the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has got a burning 2nd grade on Monday and has been depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we've caught a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (whose hand is in the association wg burning).
He's cooled upside down and we're currently seeing less (1-2x week) that makes me deal with my needs of affection and love.
My dog's just got stomach wound, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cocktail and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and squeeze for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we will also have to keep our homework, which we of course divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well aligned, I'm halfly well treated and manage.
Not good, but I'm gonna be fine and I'm almost symptomless.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 o'clock I have a written test for which I have done nothing yet and over morning anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare for something.
And next week I have an oral test immediately on Tuesday, and what then comes in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes like this: only until over morning, then it's weekend.
But after that, is everything going on?
Just until birthday.
Just until the beginning of the vacation.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it.
Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but otherwise I can't...
Do you feel like that?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't believe that in words.
I don't know if I could have survived my kptbs.
I think that's also partly related to Mental Load of Women, so I thought that I'm sure I'm finding passions here...
I wish you anyway another relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today, unfortunately, the whole different color plus surface is cracked and table leg has printed.
In the first delivery, the color was precisely as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're gonna switch the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found at school at that time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is for them just another subject like mathematics or geography.
For me, this was always a strange thing, perhaps because I was raised Christianly, and I always believed.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about working and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and occupational and it is useful to separate.
It also provides a educational plan, etc.
But if it was just strange to have a physicist who did not believe in the relativity theory.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Culture true or so?
Hope you ask is not too private.
Can't change it or not?Do you like to write English that I understand well?
It's been a very long time, then I'd disappear.
All right, thank you.
I expect a return until the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help
Hello, dear guys,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (in 24 years).
I think it's been a movie for youths.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not absolutely sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the ways cross and it arises a action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to be able to live themselves, I mean.
I think the transition is the soldier's grave place too.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight each other.
If that's something I say, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one was sleeping only on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure it's all right around, no cowboys, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No kisses.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a ceiling.
Look at your child when he sleeps.
Is it turning the head side?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is the face ahead directly in the mattress?
You can derive from that if everything's okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband came into the world, it was twenty times and there would be that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
Besides, we are already "stamkunde" with you and have already bought very many items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote from you with a colleague last night and I haven't been back yet.
It's about my suitcase that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used like this at the moment.
To tell it very clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
Only it's just that the policy of this station is now under all sweat.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go at the same time on large bedlet tour.
It was said you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Sitting Arno: You want to be "no running litre pillar".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Those of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may continue to offend the people.
A champion who is completely lacking empathy and at the explosion of the action with the hired rooms attempts to make ashes.
How can you find it all good?
It's great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking you to call back because my delivered wooden table was defective.

Whether as a comforter in the abdominal pain or simply for the cushion – My little warmth friend is a variety of customs.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional housing tool for welcoming heat applications, as Kirschkernen can take warmth very well and dosage again.
The removable inner kisses can easily be warmed in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they do not feel so well.
The cherry core kiss with reference is only suitable for the following applications as a heating emission:
Before heating the kiss, check on untypical smell, floor or fire spots and discard immediately when there is any.
Please take the inner kiss out of the reference before warming!
Heating in the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (see microwave manufacturer specifications!)
Directly after heating, the heat is distributed evenly in the kiss!
Then put the inside kiss back in the reference.
The first heating may result in a light humidity formation on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Follow the indicated heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (ontflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the warmed interior kisses have been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the kisse for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your bows!
Do not use the kiss in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverful diseases, circular disorders, fresh haematoms, blood clots and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disorders, as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If nails have opened and loose cores come out, dispose of the product and the loose core immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the child’s temperature should be monitored regularly during the use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents associated with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli victories in Düsseldorf

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network part.
I have re-cooked this five months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the network part alone was enough to operate.
Missing notice, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite inserted power part.
Then I increased the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Do you want any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of fitness also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely dispersed using the polished FlexFold sharers.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configureable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide rapid access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventional via the cap cap that can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven to be at the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a locking cap of metal with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Different from most backpacks, Peak design has designed various "filling" conditions: there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed in which the locker can be cut into.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Flip locks and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without locking the crochet.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday backpack fundamentally from others, photo-sacks: Besides the deck cap, there is a ripped locking on both sides of the backsack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to calm yourself through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suite of the backpack enormously: for if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel bags with you.
In everyday backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus distinguish both without problems - and also access it independently by the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable belts help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-fast nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting for the email from her support.

Hello, my orderer is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.2011.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you're prolonging my card, I'll give up a bigger order, but anyway I've kept the damaged furniture piece and not sent back.
And that last year was different than I thought I couldn't know and I just couldn't solve and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brakes are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are manufactured from Guss and then mechanically processed (bored and cut).
All consumed discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program will be created which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The so-produced slides ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, while the cuttings improve the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
Asthetic properties of our contemporary discs underline the character of each car by attractive and remarkable appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event represented the history of the western coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern presentation of the American River discovered shiny fractures in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and released the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest and thriving cities of the country.
Areas were decorated, tents were set up, and Saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the riches of the country.
For many, it said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to get a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, cooperate horses and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and neighbouring areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to exceed your pioneer colleagues, not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to house with your resources and build a Tableau, which is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or to apply rules to your benefits.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years of 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official government).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will choose a location on the board where they can perform actions secretly and at the same time.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
This disabled half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as the gain of resources, the movement of cars, the establishment of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The prize turns at the beginning of each round to a new location and thus modifys the available actions.
This continues until the prize has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from a rage of wrathful bandites.
If the players have accompanied enough revolver heroes and are numerously superior to the bandites, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation.
The player with most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I will take up to the measurements 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the type of shipping, goods broadcast (games folding).

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a happy guest in Talkshows and holds talks throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrannians" (2008), he launched a violent educational debate.
Former patient: Infants and pupils now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibles must never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise about the loss of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a bundle-wide delay of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinations.
"We countries need quickly clarity, whether and from when for three times vaccinated, the test obligation can be abandoned," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister Conference, the "picture on Sunday".
The disappearance of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically meaningful but also provides an additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
The Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) agreed that he would make a proposal to the Health Minister Conference on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How am I best doing that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What can this be?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sentimental perceptions under Full-Narcose.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
Most frequently it comes to hearing noises/stimmes, rarer to see pictures and most rare to see pain.
For this topic relevant: Emperor cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as you avoid a very deep anarchy to protect the child until the absorption.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcose talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read their comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the broken chair.
This is also standard in e-commerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some of money.
I already sent you an e-mail you didn't answer.
The question again.
In order and on the invoice, the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The spediteur is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they were only delivering before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that true?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can wear the heavy furniture in the first floor.
I don't get called?
I had made a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, printing fresh: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diarium of a slow departure from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I have witnessed my life thanks here."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most commonly used are Europe's flat, standardised wooden palettes, which are used mainly in the European area as charging carriers.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
In 2020, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria, according to statistics Austria.
The production value was about EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria is not collected
New York takes the MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular game time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
At the end of the Eastern Conference, New York had been conducting against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips for the perfect Gulasch here a week ago.
It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterful!
So thank you again for :)
Now I came to the taste and wants to cook to Silvester for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a bovine fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I get that
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by email that the refund was done.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check that.
Where there are in the room of Lübeck or Christmas barbecues
For many people, goose or ente belongs to Christmas days such as the ton tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time will be short.
We'll tell you where you'll get another Christmas bread in Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube level contributes significantly to the heat and to the fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor sculpture.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME rules, you can set the desired level and the defect content of your sounds on the one hand.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL rule which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
Further above already sounded that the POWER LEVEL rule can even make a performance reserve when it goes uncomfortablely.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone box can also be used as line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation, so you will get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct recordings.
The AUX books can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can join your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
In addition to spending a VFS5 footkey, you can also conveniently call on the sounds by foot, turn off/disable the effects blocks and the rate of the compatible effects thereby "tap".
This is essential for the live operation.
With his new power packages, VOX goes another step in the future!
But had seen this with others.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Because she hangs too low for a dining table?
So I would like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commode?
Do we get an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I would also be satisfied with a restraint or a bill.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I do not need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the planned hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the re-examination of the International Atomic Agreement have led to progress according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's head dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the re-existence of the agreement had been continued after nearly one week’s interruption.
Participating in the negotiations are traders of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A U.S. delegation is also on-site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in negotiations.
Thüringen obsolete Saxony - Free State now state with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has resolved Saxony and currently shows the highest incidence throughout the country.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen was the only federal country in the Corona incidence on Sunday over the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence throughout the country, this value was on Sunday at 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had decreased slightly but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with an infection were reported within one day.
200 severe Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, reporting delays may occur.
In addition, healthcare providers have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only made at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick on the package and give it to the post, was it?
here I don't have to click/define/fill any more?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I write to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###MBundesday welcomes me, I am U/StratorDE in the hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
When you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundeday, you can find one: It is not existing.
We came to a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
In most cases, this should simply be linked to the dissatisfaction, as some things have gone out here and as we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression that many here have really got bock on the MBundesday has increased.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked around the MBundeday which will keep it alive.
The hit came from U/EDISVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply said, scarf-hops.
After a few writings, several people from the Community have found their desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only so that this project can have a existence in the future.
We have developed a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundesday work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How will we take place outside in the future?
* How should new members be employed?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but what's not bad, we have the discord at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come on the discord, work with us and let us democraticly decide on the future.
I ordered you a lamp screen that is still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/cloudy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are they also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the malfunctional cabinet will be picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to move now.
I do not have an appropriate packaging, but will unmount the dish for the collection as far as possible - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to agree on a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or choose to return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She's lived vegetarian for a while, and at present she's probably rarely eating meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
The question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism has been a planned step forward, I have answered honestly without considering much.
And that I thought long that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but sometime reflected and understood that I finally also supported animal torment.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that came to her side of discouragement, then she defended vegetarism and said she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put into a corner as a veganer and conflicts arise without which you would make it.
It greets a harmonious veganer (;
It is not clearly an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal standards for remote sales.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my retours on site.
Because I can't be on site because of a funeral, that cannot be changed.
Could you assign me an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have come back constantly.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasser Rettung: 45,000 Euro Aid from the country
Recently, the Rheinland-Pfalz Innenminister Roger Lewentz delivered a return notice of EUR 45,000 for the new Equipment Car Reservation of the Volunteer Firefighter Lannstein to Oberburgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135.000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this,” says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the Taucherstafel Lannstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They perform over and under water tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lannstein, there is a permanent expectation of increasing operations: the tree of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the increasing use of the lans as recreational flow contributes to this.
I bought a book that I could read only 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app has reloaded NOT worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has spent me a lot of time and now hopes for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time, thank you for thinking about the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we also talked about arms in the executive, I don't want to go to that!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in the special uniform and weapon carrier people right from conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then, of course, be difficult to deal with the living reality, is also clear, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not mean now the exaggerated feminine clichés, because they are in the executive rather less to no but quite normal men and women that you don't notice if they can't tell you) and also on these people, and I have to rely on me, because in doubt they save your life or set it in for you.
But even these border groups represent even if it sounds strange for the first time that I have a conservative attitude, speaking proudly to Germany and feel more deprived by overdriven left policy, even if this policy is supposed to be in favour of them or thinks it is necessary to make it right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armies are also a cross-section of society, extreme rights will also be found there, but they can openly say their opinions there or even make up any publicly dangerous plans are completely exaggerated and annoy me too.
Of course, policemen and soldiers who have often been in foreign operations often start to pause because of negative experiences and sometimes also say things that are controversial to politically incorrupted.
It is also likely that right attitudes will also meet those who engage in a real exchange of thoughts.
Yet, I believe that this is well combated and that political education and education will also counteract the whole thing!
Germany is so very internationally scattered and that is so good as I think we could not afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our rows at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order that's no longer available.
I talked with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you can deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the part of the wood are two deep carvings, which were filled with something yellow,
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Orderable by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working on one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but I have been getting it more bad than right to keep my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and wash.
But it's never like that 'sometimes someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is no better (sworrow) nor better, although it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses budget simply against work and discomfort.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now, on my question, have you managed to get better with a child?
We have nothing yet to do with it, and this question has been discussing me for a while.
Because I have no incentive for me, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit is coming and, for example, always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incitement with a child, or do you stay dirty?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have trained in the area of software development and have now been taught for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have been thinking about restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an uncertain (e.g. fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly saying that I have no self-respect and therefore be shy.
I have no problem talking to people at the relevant level, but it seems very difficult to have loose conversations and it has been said to me more often that I act insecurely (which I think I've already got better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth event, but rather in such a drug advice or family assistance.
But I do not know whether the actual working day is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it draws me down every time there's something to disturb my code ("although the simplest things to do) and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know what's going on"/"I'm holding him with my stupid questions away from work"/"he really needs to think I'm really less funded" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at the moment.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for a date for collection
What do they mean to give back !
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be authorized by your #PRS_ORG#
Is there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) included with the feed breaks the bird in its stomach intestinal tract into the individual proteins (amino acids) and builds from it its own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The feathering formation in the nestling and the feathering new formation of the miceing bird is extremely complex and for the total organism of the animal is associated with a particularly high demand.
Please note that NEKTON bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise occur in the breast-breast-feeding course.
Following this coherent administration of NEKTON-Bio, NECTON-S (Multivitamine) and NECTON-MSA (Mineral Products) should be re-administered to the daily supply of vitamins.

1 g NECTON bio at 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/smooth feed as the bird consumes daily and to switch water/food daily.
A stroked measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON bio.
In the case of severe fieder damage, the double or three-fold dose of NECTON bio can be administered at the beginning until the approach of feather rehabilitation is visible.
Then the normal dose will be reached until the feather rehabilitation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair be broken after 9 months?
The guarantees in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and images have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Pronunciation of a communal worker in contradiction with the statute
Hello R/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
We're supposed to fall a walnut tree on our property.
So it's a case request to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus also the whales are not part of the statute.
However, in the statute the whale is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a restraint or a card?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think the only question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check that?
Equipment: Severe traffic accident in self
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord and Plößberg connector.
As the police press warning currently reports (14:03 p.m.), a truck came into counter traffic when it was taken over.
There are injured ones.
I understand.
Well, then thank you again for doing so easy!
Advisory advice and ideas on further vocational life
First of all, celebrate Christmas to you!
Sadly, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head just breaks everything you can think.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation - so of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-border climb.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there also in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise here).
But then it was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are significantly unflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care about that.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job orders".
And it's only about half a year.
During the paints before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, then I can still swing around.
But right now I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time in the last month that I was completely lying.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my celebration evening.
That's where I had free.
And the stress at work was no matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these staring structures that add to me nerves.
In principle it makes fun and from outside viewed, the Ref also works well as regards the feedback and so.
But I'm totally ugly and wondering how much stress my body endures before he makes it completely closed - if he doesn't already.
I wonder whether I would like to have this for the rest of my life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed them, and although the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter like this is the most time of the case now.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place in a year as now and have been dissatisfied.
You notice that it's all somewhat worse, but maybe you've come out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and starting to cry at the smallest point.
I will not make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me first.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for my crying subton.
I hope that my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has constantly developed, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" sculpture, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to the latest in the matter of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and Amp shells, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube preamps.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a pipe amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this tailored switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances are only sprouting.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX you can even correct and curve historical facts at the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which has led to the VOX Valvetronix series again in anno 2010, with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to make all guitarists looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of play dynamics and string attacks as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that in particular the end level determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circulation of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube is perfectly depicted by the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Lose magic in Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in NBA stops.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main factor is also adaptable: with three individual plazier and foldable closure parts, it is fully suited to the need of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all size orders to full format mirror cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an connected lens, two to three interchange objectives and an alternate flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further objectives.
Also, there is a lot of accessories that can be dispersed.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-external things.
Drohnen pilots also meet an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the lava streams have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary island since Sunday.
The outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was the longest on the Atlantic island of the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the yet nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have no further expectation of the time when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Injury in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of the hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new land tongues of a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
Especially the island's extremely important banana cultivation, of which about half of the about 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was in crisis before the volcanic outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been linked to the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension something seducing on itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
The more important thing is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peaceful "Community treaty of natural peoples", could be evaporated and resurrected with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian child
Strictly, it was the Protestants through which the Christmas Days were closely linked with the gifts.
Previously on Nikolaus day, gifts were given in some way.
The background of this popular practice today is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra threw three women in one night secretly gold into their windows to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany proved to fill the boots with gifts mainly to the children.
Protestants encountered this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and humans as "sacred worship".
For these reasons, they are protecting against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift thus moved to the sacred evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions, only the few are annoying that the practice of the Holy Nikolaus is similar to Martinsingen and Martinsing is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas time.
Today you find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to luxury eager to all that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have proved a tradition of the gift since the 13th century on the day of the Holy Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of the gift moved to the sacred evening.
In all Christian - characterized countries, however, a cheerful kiddelmuddel has the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or on the Christmasman, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some types of property in time.
This includes, for example, his white noise bar, which has little common with the rather strict asicur bar of the historical figure, its slides, which are drawn by pensions and the preferential of the camel to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas Festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while it is the witch Befana in Italy, which must have shown them the way to the Son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabulous beings sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers frost to some glory.
There are not penalties here, but three horses who are pulling his sleeves as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for giving the gifts.

Police shoots suspect ban robbers near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
There are several messages in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family live there.

Pillen problem
Hello, dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year, actually saves my first post.
To my problem: I began to take the pills again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let it remain again because I have to take enough medicines that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had received some two-year break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickel and this everywhere.
So far as surface, but I've been pretty stressed, and I'm not feeling well.
In the two years of break, everything has never really normalized.
Maybe somebody's got any tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are free of perfume and without a genotype, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the woman doctor has not taken me so seriously and the skin doctor's date is still coming.
Many love thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertaire severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then huge knee flee and the acne topic.
Food I have also tried everything possible in the course of Chr. disease and have remained on the bottom of sugar, milk and meat poor mixture food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormone is simply the worm in it, but if you have anywhere like me you want to stop looking for something else is still wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o.a.
Writed and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I have to work all the time and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is to test if the money was there, I would have seen it

Ref: Plan education (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in Ref since the summer, the teaching is fun, but I currently have great problems efficiently planning my education in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (what is nervous for soil).
I now just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and I actually stand for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are also repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I am always going from learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then wonder how I can build it (mostly I create a workbook with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
That is why the workpapers are also.
Maybe a peer teacher like you can work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to finish the retours for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears because of the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most affairs, only who is vaccinated or healed may still be allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and regrets sales breakdowns.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G rules devastate the important Christmas business from the view of the German Trade Association (HDE) to retail trade.
In case of transactions with articles of non-day need, sales breakdowns should be complained, HDE head business leader Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey by HDE under 1100 merchants, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many would already have awarded the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Thus, traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly one third of their precrisis rates during the past week.
It's good only in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concepts is a safe matter, said the main business manager.
"2G in purchasing does not bring us forward in the fight against pandemics," he stressed.
The current rules scared customers and required high staff efforts.
He requested that the bandage system be approved all over the country.
After that, each customer should only be controlled once to 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the receipt band this day.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport at the 3G rule (vaccinated, healed or tested), sampling should be sufficient.
The real estate group specialized in shopping centres German Euroshop also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the turnovers at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safe in the middle of such important Christmas business," said director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative efforts, the Centre is attempted to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called bandage solution where, for example, "the visitors at a central place in the centre can once deliver their 2G reception and then – equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel – uninterrupted enter all shops".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and at the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That looks uncomfortable.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package.
What do I have to do for the trip now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides extraordinary possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash store.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitively accessible.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flaverless.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can light large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
Moreover, in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 -Controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted to difficult accessible places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the range of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage sites, you will simply be obliged and finished by pressing one of the storage keys longer.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so when new switching, the well-known situation remains - very practical in the studio work if, e.g., the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the battery has sufficient power - it is an battery ster as built in - for each of the two battery generators a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the lighter via the supplied power part with electricity.
The construction of the lightning lamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm cover as a connection to mounting, so you can directly access your photo stative.
The inclination should be reliable on both sides by means of firms.
It has been respected that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for long-standing and hard use.
In addition, a nail line is included in the range of delivery.
It's huge that's also a bag in the range of delivery.
Thus you can transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Damage that I have given and she's too small :(
"Party that we wanted to hit": Frankfurt celebrates after a torque comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of Sieglos Hessen was supposed to be on the way to the next federal league.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frust about a grown seasonal start of the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to each individual who was there."
At the beginning, it looked after a new damper for the Frankfurter, now on rank nine, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schicks had led the liver kisses with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainers.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defense player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the place for the first time since the fourth play day and his overwhelmed muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a view to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to hit today.
But for the future tasks, Glasner wants to keep its focus now, but it is also well established with regard to the personal situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live high professionally.
Now you want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and to "take through the tasks at this level" until the change of the year.
Next on Wednesday, a foreign game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the program in the course of the English week.

I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money has been transferred back and give up the order again?
I'm sorry to say that I won't be ordering again because it's been a very long time.
Have they been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Steamers for handball wives before quarterfinale against Spain
Germany's handball wives slew after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the parket.
At 16:32 (8:13) before 800 viewers in granollers, the DHB selection was defeated to the end of the WM's main round and now has to go to the quarterfinale against host Spain.
"We were too worried and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must be different against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game we had to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entering into the semi-final, a significant increase must be made against the WM seconds of 2019 on the next Tuesday in order to maintain the tender dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German Werferin in the Duell with the three-fold Olympiasian Denmark was the back-up player Alina Grieseels with six towers.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked: "We have to look forward quickly."
From top to back not on height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German crew was not high.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4-resistance after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate succeeded in the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greyeels successfully completed a rapid contradiction.
However, the hoped initial inflammation was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly sit in scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the gate of Scandinavians.
Thus, the game was running at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially as backspace player Mia Zchocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
However, in the quarterfinal, she may be involved again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least at five gates.
The silent hope of a rehearsal after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it simple to the well-deployed opponent, who, at the end, is among the medal candidates.
As a result, the German crew could no longer rise to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parket.

The title exists that I am an vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams in which (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccined in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished to a large extent, then, partly in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, I'm dealing with vaccination.".
In my task field, the information for vaccination, the indication position (Person has the right to vaccination according to Corona vaccination order and no reasons to speak against), the medical documentation and possibly emergency care for allergic reactions (mir never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegatable to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In Impfteams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but who do not have any vaccination (necessary?), so that I can do most vaccinations myself there.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Hudler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bayern" has provided for strong thoughts.
But different from in many days before, the term in the "Host My?" series remained unfair this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous".
And no one, "what everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV-moderator, was totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg told the solution, and so probably also provided amazement for many of the chief peppers.
"The Huidler," the audience heard, "is a laptop with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectic researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert on Bayerische Fernsehen for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical oberphaltic term, derived somehow from the rather known word "Hoorten".
What was closed with a educational gap - probably also with some who have long lived in Amberg space.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is always coming: opens - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired the PC.
Nothing helped.
Deck choice at the race wheel, really so safe?
Tomorrow I was awakened full of action because I wanted to train at least a little in the next week to prepare my bicycle tour.
Said, done, and I drove with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in such a inner city (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splits on the route.
Zack, loud cischen, and my rear ripped wouldn't have to go with the rest of the line at all.
Because I had no real opportunity to get a replacement cloak and a replacement hose because of the week's day, I had to turn back with half a bad lip and take the first path home.
Then it wasn't very bad, perhaps it's better if I practice it again before the cycling tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would be very unfortunately getting this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, came up the day I picked up the bike until 14 p.m. 120km!) and which had already described them as suboptimal because he was rolling with them for more years.
But if I think that I have to make a deck change after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly kicked :D
Now I came to the conversation with an elder at the railroad, who wondered why I wouldn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unfit.
Now, of course, it sounds very attractive.
But are these really so incredible?
I have little desire now to spend 40€/riffs, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have at the moment on the racing wheel, I think 25x622.
Although there are (likely?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to other tyres in a race bike generally?
The sulphur page seems to be my absolute! Laie knows rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you again in advance for the help and dear greetings!

The 53-year-old was punished on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reason against a medieval island and then approached the counterway, as the police informed.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and put the man in the car.

After the publication of our new High End Breitband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also receive return.
SOLO 15 is the new sprout and is an optical reminder of the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal a suitablely designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for individuals whose maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but which is to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to create almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive for its size and exactly.
Tonal was aligned with a slightly high-tone increase in SOLO 15.
This is commonly used in broadbands to optimise the too high frequencies strongly increasing bandage.
Exactly on the hearing area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outside, the high-ton area can be reduced and thus the sound image is warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and excitingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series but extends it in matters of resolution and precision.
As with all our sets of construction, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker to plan the corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the lowering of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the furnier brings on material again.
After all the plates were cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the corresponding place to be able to carry out the cable without any problem later.
Using an upper frog now follows the speaker opening in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used strictly later.
Reversely, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker cassette as large as possible in the interior.
The four screwpoints of the B 100 - 6 OHM are given an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image “Detail Phase”.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a level surface in front of you.
The back wall, the ceiling, the front and the ground are now attached to them.
The three stipples should also be used and glued.
If necessary, the inductions may vary in the material strength, for example, if you want to take back from the construction market, instead of making it itself from 16 mm MDF.
The second page will be placed in the next step of work.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, the two sides, as well as the front.
The installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube is facilitated by an appropriate hole circuit saw or a forest bore, as well as the connection clip on the back wall.
Then one uses a round freezer to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footboard can also be rounded off.
Afterwards the footboard is firmly glued with the foot of the house and also screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the signs and pre-bours (2.5-mm drills) of the screwpoints of the speaker cassis and the connectors.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (sucking off / blowing out), the cable will begin to be placed.
The simplest thing is to do this through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncutted cable is pushed through the 8 mm drilling into the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely out there.
The frequency fold is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the spectrum wipe, as well as the corresponding connector plan, can be taken from the following document: assembly manual Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency fold is installed and the connector terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the inside of the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some fit, you can drop hot stickers to the opening and so lock.
The opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the term follows according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and assembled with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be killed at the Pluspole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For the detection, a matte of the vacuum material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the cabinet.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and deliver first at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will re-organize OSCAST this year!
> We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people to the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But, hey, it is still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at 0.30 a.m.
Have some cold drinks, plant good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
