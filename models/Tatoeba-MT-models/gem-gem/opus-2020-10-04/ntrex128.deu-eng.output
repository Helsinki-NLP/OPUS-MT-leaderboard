Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusions with the muppets
The proposal to change its title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament) gives rise to disturbance.
This is why plans are to change the name of the National Assembly in 'Welsh Parliament' (Walish Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly fear all political directions to become the target of spot.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was worried because the name ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’ are crying.
For non-Walisian readers: In the Wales, 'twp' stands for 'doof' and 'pwp' for 'aa'.
A national member of the Plaid Cymru Party argued that the whole group “is not happy” and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of national members of the Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Agency published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of national members of the Assembly, the 'Welsh Parliament' (Walish Parliament Members) or 'WMPs' was preferred, while in a public hearing the 'MWP' option was the largest support.
Members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the consensus to the Chairman Elin Jones, which is to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The Law on Reforms will contain further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of national members of the Assembly and for the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonian voted in a referendum on a change in country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set up to settle a decades of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province of the same name as Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbours means that this right to the Greek territory is raised and has repeatedly opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is the price to be paid for EU accession and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” said Adams.
"Today there is no longer both of them."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was retrospectible.
“The social life of people is different today,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough for as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “be back to the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people who do not support the remaining refugee places.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these property apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropole: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's one decade later.
The original white methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held their worships nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, leading a Boykott by retailers in the 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support black people.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's municipal members planned to rebuild, they commissioned the watch game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the watch game as “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who listened to the watch game in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "a unnecessary historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, which was changed 18 years ago to the larger watch game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors that were partly attracted by the church leaders and partly by the Bishop Diocese.
In July, the Board of Directors of the municipality expressed written concerns to the Diocese that the Diocese would try to share the costs to the Community board, although it had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some municipal members complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai hurt in California 13-year-old while diving to praise
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster Season, a hai attacked a 13-year-old boy during diving to praise.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the transmitter KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and with several others hiding to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy shouted: “I was bite!
I've been biten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his whole key leg was upset.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hawk.
The boy was fled to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue Swimmer Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officers locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for the purpose of investigation and for security reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to combat the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with cosmetic divisions that are occupied with specialized assistants.
In the context of a large-scale precipitation to the UK’s UK cosmetic market, which continues to grow while fashion and budget numbers decline, the larger cosmetic divisions will be tested in eleven branches across the country. If they are successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics combines with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used shop surfaces for television, microwave equipment and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's data, the range of its cosmetics for the first time doubles up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its make-up series “Boutique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branches of sales. The first sales point was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and another is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small quantities of food in local needs items stores means that supermarkets need to do more to enable customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales offices will be increasingly like shopping houses, since the supermarket chain with more services and non-food articles is trying to fight the discounts Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has established a number of habitat sales sites in hundreds of branches of argos and habitat since the purchase of the chains of Argos and habitats two years ago. This has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a dispute about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches into the supermarkets ended.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company argued that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy are added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues available as consultants.
Our brand palette is circumcised to all needs. Because of the attracting environment and the cheap locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchasing which challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones “wrathful” after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den” Star Peter Jones is “wrathful” after the TV-moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to concentrate on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angry “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones through its very short-term withdrawal from its lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been angry when the “Golden Girl” of television admitted, at an excited meeting on Tuesday at the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to be able to devote to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly no longer enough time because of their new businesses – at the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holidays.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should safeguard her future in the next decades for the long term.
Their decision for withdrawal was surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the introduction of the market.
In the centre of Marlow a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, which is one of the most promising Stars of the UK, could cost the company millions because of high investments in products from kiss and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely acquainted with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend their vacation together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is intended to become brand messenger for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderner of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night: “We do not comment on his business matters.”
Heavy words "and then we have loved"
He grudged about the criticism that he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for such positive comments on the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a newsmoderator:
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a great step towards the Denuclearization of North Korea.
However, denuclearisation negotiations have taken place.
Over three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, the Supreme Diplomacy of North Korea, said to politicians from all over the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North of the United States would not see a “consistent” response to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States held sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his presentation.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were in the face of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and the return of the mortal survivors of American military subjects.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this overfilled arena, about 200 people would stand here,” said Trump and pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate a island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were distributed from Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so that is a little difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children set up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the site.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Disaster Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies would be involved in aid measures.
In view of the earth's shocks with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still unfortunately badly prepared for natural forces.
While aceh Tsunami accommodations were built, they are not a daily view on other coastal stripes.
The evidently lack of tsunami warnsiren in Palu, despite a warning in force, has probably contributed to death.
Travelling between Indonesia's numerous islands presents a challenge in the optimum case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at least in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the imposed Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has abundantly spent money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Yoko re-electing next year suffers from financial deficits.
Yoko is also under pressure by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Machenes, Arrows and Bogs as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday in the London Stamford Bridge Stadion with a meeting in the 89th minute before a premiere league loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1-resistance in about 27 meters from Chelsea gate.
He directed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the back pepper.
The shot sailed high over the penalty room and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for me” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I have seen edges come and had a contact with the ball. I haven’t thought too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard after a meeting in the 25th minute at half time with 1:0.
The Blues Storm gave a passport with the fers back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defense behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker by the back of the network.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 in the stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is present on Thursday at 15:00 in London in the UEFA Europe League Videoton.
The number of deaths of the Tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the catastrophic protection authority reported on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been caught in the ruins of buildings that had been caught by the earthquake of the strength 7.5 from Friday, which had triggered up to six meters high waves, reports the government speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded with the ruins of buildings.
Police arrests a man, 32, for murder suspects after a woman was stabbed.
After the finding of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with injuries in Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspects.
The police call on the inhabitants to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the greatest importance for our study."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who believe the woman have arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are running, and the police informed that it is about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was loud when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer said to a man that the whole area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of events.
It repeats repeatedly, "that's so terrible."
Two police vehicles were inside the locking and another vehicle before the locking.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were watching the residential block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or to contact Crimestopers anonymously under 0800 555 111 under heading 0800, and refer to the Protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell state in front of Parliament will become the latest monument of the dispute on the rewriting of history
Their exile would be poetic justice for his reminding destruction of the Taliban so many cultural and religious art products of England through its fanatic puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the image of Oliver Cromwell was the goal before the palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English Civil Wars was neither organized nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's prevailing opinion and part of the history of a figure that is still worth being celebrated.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today than one who considers Parliament against pressure from outside, of course through the monarchy, in his case.
Whether it is a completely appropriate presentation, the subject of continuing history debates is.
Surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single acknowledged figure that represents one side of this gap.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer swine bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man named Yuan was only invented dead with a distinct artery in the vicinity of a swine set on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China, a pig builder is prepared to inject pigs vaccines.
According to reports on Wednesday, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yuntan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring swine count was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on the snow.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had died to the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and damped," the cousin, the surname "Wu", was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate reports on a compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos heavy pig embraced a whale farmer between himself and a tractor until the lady of the farmer could devour the animal.
After a farmer had been eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could work as “savers”.
“They are only spilled.
They like to scratch and are very curious, ... they are not looking for hurting someone.
You just need to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rain in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. east coastal time, Rosa showed up wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to an orchid of category 1, and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa moves north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form over the Pacific, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger rainfall in parts of Mexico up to 25 cm on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture produces widespread rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the emerging trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm rainfall can cause hazardous flooding, in water driving shoots and possibly grounds in the desert.
High tropical moisture sometimes leads to rainfall rates from almost 5 to 7,5 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, it is expected up to 5 to 10 cm rainfall.
Due to the spread of the tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flooding floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently advised to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can cause canyons to become cracking streams, and thunder brings local windbows as well as wind that leads to dust.
The nearby trog brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that total decline amounts of more than one inch, which can lead to small amounts of water-driving treadways and smooth railways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it prevails.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, there are strong temperature variations in the whole of the United States, as the Arctic is cooling while the tropicals remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the Middle and East of the United States, a warm October start is expected with widespread temperatures of 27 °C from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of excessive temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million spectators saw the feasing statements of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political Patt situation continued. On Friday, the television broadcasters interrupted their regular program because of a turn in the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, so that the FBI should carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford announced to the Senate's Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had troubled her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million observers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company identified the average audience numbers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had issued the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring audience numbers in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: this is the same as the audience's numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar award.
The transmitter Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, says Nielsen, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the daily hearing.
ABC came to the second place with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the play of Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office published an explanation that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee urged him loudly with words.
He stood for minutes with a lower look while he was trained. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said that his office published an explanation and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the Committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later when the Justice Committee should vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote to the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demands the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump caused a FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using the Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for withdrawal from the European Union to use the future of Great Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on September 29, 2018 on the party day of the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the head of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified its attack on its so-called "Chequers Plan" for the Brexit by calling for a proposal that provides for the mutual entrance of customs duties by Britain and the EU as "exclusively absurd".
Deathful shoots on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned by Baton Rouge, police officers.
The Authority published videos of the controversy between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that the glass DNA was found on the glasses by Simpson.
After an interview with Simpson, the police stated that he was putting the deadly shots on Wayde.
The Advocate reports that the deposit was fixed at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot in the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police criminal laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Port Director Joe Allva thanked the Regional Executive Authority for “their care and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m big wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he reached an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer of the LSU said, Will Wade, the team was "deeply shocked" over Waydes' death and "stand under shock".
"You're always afraid of something like this," said Wade.
Vulcan spys ashes in Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached ashes emitted from the volcano Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and were registered within 24 hours 183 gas and ash emissions.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grills and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ashes layers on the windshields of cars in fourths of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity in the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a earthquake had shaken the strength of 7.1 Central Mexican.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separaters before anniversary of independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collisions between the Reconciliation Police and Pro-Independence Demonstrants. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the Polarizing Independence Reference in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the readyness police, conquered them with eggs and also screwed colour powder, so that in the streets normally populated with tourists, dark dust clouds were created.
In the course of the day, there were also hand joints with the police who used their beats to reduce the fights.
For several hours, pro-independency groups “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness” were scanned, while they faced Unionists who called “Long Life Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated because of smaller injuries in the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separateist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The voters had decided with overwhelming majority for independence, although the election participation was low, since the division opponents mainly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-independency groups had camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we're hanging fast," he said.
Despite an important, though hard, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties of this year had difficulties in maintaining the vibration. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in captivity, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest for the police on his phone, said that the conflict was swollen by politicians on both sides.
"The situation becomes more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been investigated since the end of last year, announced his candidate for election to the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the election of Europe, it is the best way to overcome democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house was struck by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been struck several times by a car.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, with a bracelet breast, it may have been shot to the car.
Menga-treffer means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first port for Livingston secured the victory.
The risen Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Hiter proved to be a decisive factor in the fact that Gary Holt's team was able to be equal to Hibernian in the second half time.
Gerrard's team remains in the Prime Ministership in this season without outward victory and is faced with the hearts that are left eight points on the next Sunday.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers are hosts in Europe League for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the Division to six games, i.e., that Chief Trainer Holt has not recorded any defeat since his overtake of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against freely playing guests
Holt's team had to have been in leadership long before the meeting, since his directness put the Rangers before various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down before the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had been hit down to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts satisfied to let the Rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance when Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly brought Menga in shot position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and the Gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers Torkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow swallowed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks went to Livingston's penalty room and were regularly taken out of the risk area, while two required penalties – one of Halketts against Glenn Middleton and one for hand game – were refused.
“Phenomenal” of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her way of playing and her team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt is a great commendation for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they couldn't reach this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ crew – and this is something like a call for the Rangers that are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue skys ruled when the rulers of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom to press and accession to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for preventing a 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many attendants arrived nearby to see their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurden – also received hearing. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as heroes and reproached by others as autocrates.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies when collapsed with car
When a car crashed, a bike driver died in London.
The collision took place around 10:15 p.m. of the British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficful road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the Sanitarians took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another bicycler was killed in an accident with a rider flight in the Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to inform his next family.
Road blocks and redirections for buses are set up, and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officials injured in disturbance
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men in the case of disturbances.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 p.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialised "Tornado" officials were drawn to stop the disturbances involved in eight inmates who are limited to a wing.
The officials were treated locally for smaller injuries in the face.
A speaker of the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff were used to remedy a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that the police officers are being handed over and perhaps spend longer behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that after an attack the prisoner was treated by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were called into prison to deal with serious disturbances where the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (thorn areas may benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but just that will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the remains of Hurrikan Rosa move across the southwest of deserts and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Monday and Tuesday, from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches with rain on Monday evening and moves directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometres!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center prognosticize 5 to 10 cm rainfall with a single up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, which are characterized by deserts, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and individually possible up to 10 centimeters.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa may be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although floods are very concerned, this rain is likely to be partly useful, since the southwest is currently dry.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, some more than 40 percent of Arizona appear at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have the peak winds of 136 kilometres per hour and 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move with 19 kilometres per hour to the north.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
In parts of Mexico, the rainfall may be severe, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfall rates are expected from 7,5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move northward over Mexico, on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression reach the border to Arizona and then move up to the south of Utah until late service evening through Arizona.
The National Hurricane Center informed: “As the main danger of Rosa or their remnants is expected to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the United States characterized by deserts.”
As a result of these precipitations, in the wilderness life-threatening floods and in the waters of driving treasury and in mountainous areas are expected droughts.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the finding of a 16-year-old sting wound in Somerset, three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspect of the attempted murder.
The teenager was injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Wheelstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the common, the anger” of the democratics.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the scrupelless and unheard tactics of democracies,” said Trump at an advertising in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered during the entire nomination process 'under the common, the anger' of the democratics.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the convention and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually disturbed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also declared its accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brillance, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirming one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public”, he said the quantity of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
I'm not going on, but in reality I'm going on," he said.
"I therefore fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democratics saw their mission "to resist and block".
The first important procedureal vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high staff member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquakes in Indonesia, victims rise
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were disappeared because of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, a gigantic wave hit the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people met at a festival on the beach of Palu, when the darkness broke up to six meters high waves on the beach and many people rise to death and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami had been a earthquake of 7.5 in advance.
“When the threat of the tsunami occurred yesterday, people still went on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell to him as a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority GDPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he took cars, trees and houses with him, he met all things on land,” said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the escape from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and stayed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by other aftercrews.
The earthquake series was experienced in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in an explanation that energy released from the massive quake of Friday was the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb cast on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the Authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "total" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruined buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, could have been higher.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed by Nugrohos, and no information was provided.
According to the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves received official information at the time of warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man at the upper floor of a building, desperately warning the people on the street under him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water on the coast and swimming buildings and cars of it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Through the earthquake and the tsunami, there was a massive power loss that interrupted the communication around Palu and trilled the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other life-necessary goods.
The city airport remains closed until October and was reopened for assistance only.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami sacrifices has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the staff in tent accommodations are located in their office's courtyard, but, according to words, dosebas passed on the scenes of the destruction.
“They told me they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the assistant groups began the hard task of launching the disaster aid, some were assuming that professional foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian Law, financial assistance, supply and staff from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been declared to the national disaster area.
This hasn't happened until now.
“On the moment there is another disaster on the Provinces,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status is not valid until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami descended from Friday over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for them on one of the miracles that light up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a waste water channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been embedded for two days in ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month to end Asia games in Indonesia.
Other of the Roa Roa hotel prisoners were his students, as Mondayi supplemented.
“As a senior in the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after the message of the crash of the Roa Roa hotel under the paragliders, WhatsApp news was desperately sent to the contesting participants from Palu who attended the beach festival.
His news, however, resulted only in grey questionnaires instead of blue hooks.
“I think that means that the news have not been posted,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change precedes its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the consignment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has abandoned for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Big Boy Radiomoderator.
“I am you, I am us, it’s us.
From Kanye, what means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ became a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more reflecting what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which the West has worked before, has also written his name with and without boundaries and uppercase letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use the military against civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repressia against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people. At that time left-oriented student movements were working to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by monthly support for students and the opening of further free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training possibilities brought to young people criminal bands.
The United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the increased activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double their research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of the US Government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the number 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for KI research would be a good start, given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the United States. We are looking for the next CI break," said Lee.
The doubled financial resources could double the chances that the next major CI success in the United States would be achieved, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent CI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University at a KI system that defeated the highest placed American Othello player. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google Delegation in China.
Lee deserved earlier technology competitions by the US Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked for the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
After reading words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
“Not China takes away the academic top forces, but the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Corypheen from universities to work at KI in recent years.
Read believes that a changed immigration policy of the United States could also be beneficial for the US's KI efforts.
“I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of CI promoveed people,” he said.
China's State Council presented his plan for the development of the next generation of KI technology (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to reading words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spending money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science should be involved. The White House also announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests over 100 million US dollars annually in the KI research.
In the meantime, no action has been done for months with U.S. staff regarding the education of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonian voted in referendum on a change in country name
The people of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country was to be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would append a decade of old conflict with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this right to the Greek territory is raised, so Greece has made a veto against the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum. A Boykott campaign doubts that the election participation achieves the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was, "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change in name, among which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, will be worth the price of entry into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would follow the result so that it is crucial.
The change in name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there were no reports on irregularities by 13 p.m.
However, the election participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last Parliament elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters had voted.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in the referendum on the change of the country name that Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs before tents set up by persons who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will lead to investments that are urgently needed for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will be in this respect, since more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a "Yes" result would be a " confirmation of our future".
According to a Monday survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian transmitter Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order to be successful in the referendum, election participation must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the policy of the prowest government since its power acquisition in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his meeting look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He rushed between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defense and then picked up several other defenses on the edge of the penalty room of Brighton.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the punishment room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overwhelmed with his right shoe Brighton-torguard Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the network.
“Aguero fights with problems in his feet,” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about that he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he reached a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier-League-Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steilpass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues anchor targeted the ball into the net just before he got out.
City plays in the Champions-League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies' game
Since the nationals were excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the always powerful joke hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the rockies who have a game in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the playoffs.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard on Friday evening with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals, but still wants to secure their first division title.
“While we play for nothing, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the audiences here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a start player for Sunday, but reports say that they are inclined to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this was the 34th use as a start player, practiced on Thursday in the bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington Law Hand has this season with a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump holds announcement in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board Kavanaugh selected by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
This is one of the big, big – I don't act, but in reality, I'm going to fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it happen right now.
And they are determined to take over the power with all the means, you see the commonness, the abomination.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to drive over to receive power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The democratics, he said, see their mission in 'to resist and block'.
“And you see this in the last four days,” he said and called the democratics “wrathful and cruel and awful and dishonest”.
He named the highest democracy in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Finstein, which triggered the audience's calls.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document out?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer leaves all the opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of cheating me, this came little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour delegates who are said they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had exercisively opposed antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tadel request for a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that 'the meetings should all include and be productive'.
Mostly the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as local labor deputy were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today have not been characterized by this sound, and the promised 'friendlyer, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It becomes more and more clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is assessed afterwards whether it is accepted by the party tip.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I believed to share similar political views now expected me to make a rejection and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with, whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a shimpftirade in the social media, which calls for my choice, calls on the political center and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I'm not here alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who, every day, face a flood of sexist or racist abuses and nevertheless bear little attention.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that vaccination has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked the Labour Party last week to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not let all the opinions apply anymore, and with any distrust request and any change in the rule of election, the party becomes tightened.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to withdraw my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would not have any problems.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, caused by the negligence of the Thatcher government, because my classroom was literally distinguished in the overall school, the Labour Party joined, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a community member as well as as a cabinet minister.
I never made a hole out of my political views, even when it came to the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the request on Friday: in view of the fact that the country is going to rush to a brexit, to harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not addressing this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats or political purposes will not prevent me from acting in my opinion of the best interest of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining game of the day in the tentt's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten crews that are not hit at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home crew was due to its superior defense as well as to their better chances, and trainer Peter Murchie had all reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games until now, and we are still inflicted, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Respect for Ayr, they have better used their chances than we.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, because of a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, the numbers could speak, and Jason Baggot received an unincreased attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty, before he reached a hit right at half time and then achieved an increased attempt in the entrance, so it was for a break of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose, however, began the second half time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Following this, there was a longer interruption due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After continuing, Ayr built his predecessor through an attempt by Climo increased by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as the captain of Ayr, he received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose paid the additional man by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and as Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the penalty gas from a touchdown behind the advanced Ayr package.
Climo increased as nearly since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxkick and flank player Gregor Henry sent for the fifth attempt of home crew.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
“Still Game”Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the host industry, after it became evident that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, whose turnbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles with his long-year-old Comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth stack will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow's “flowering restaurant” shop.
“The sea belongs to us”, the Bolivia, which is included in the country, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol before the Marine Headquarters decorated with Tauwerk in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
Fleet support points from the Titicacasee to the Amazon carries the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Recovering it is a duty."
Overall in Bolivia, the memory of the 19th-century coastal section lost in a bloody conflict of resources in Chile is still as vital as the desire to resurrect the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice, which is to be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the swing, a spirit of unity and quietness and expects the result, of course with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH's judgment on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand, according to which Chile is obliged to negotiate over the sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea for decades.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is going to be a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday is also at stake.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he commended at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body with its seat in the Netherlands is not entitled to address the Chilean territory and has established that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the IGH judgment has been held six months after the final plea, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, concludes that the case was “not complicated”.
Apart from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a relapse.
“The current Bolivian government has taken the question of access to the sea,” said Zárate.
She indicated that the warrior rhetoric of Morales has embroidered any good will remaining in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their conversations, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Den Haag, rejected the view that the judgment of the Court had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “finish the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also contradicts that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political crawl.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disrupt its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to make the promises made during a summit between the chief leaders of the rivals in Singapore into action.
His statements arrive at a time when, more than three months after the summit with the North Korean state captain Kim Jong-un in Singapore, the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be shortly ahead of it to restart the atmosphere diplomacy.
Ri declared that further sanctions and the opposition of the United States against an explanation of the end of the Korean war would ever force the North into the knees, as 'herngespinnst'.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without taking significant steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngjang is serious with the absence of an arsenal where the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect the sun completely, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the course a range of crazy over-sized head covers for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Pariser fascination week.
Extremely inpractical hats have flooded in this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creatures over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a feather-like broad edge, which precisely pressed the heads of the models.
As other superdimensional accessories, water melons occupied with jewels, a magic hat and even ananas were shown. These are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were furnished with lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skine couture.
One creation was like a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten acetic.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you'll be lucky.
Mode observers prognosis that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hat follows directly on “La Bomba”, the Strohhut with 60 cm wide edge, all of which are wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the extremely inpractical hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the course: a beach bag of straw that was almost as large as the model that weared a bath suit that kept the bag.
The bastach in red orange with bastfrans and a white leather cap was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect that large shelters and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has so much excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens indispensable
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This continued with further excellent test results in 2018 and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest level possible.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector, which can form a customised educational plan and actually implement, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as elections.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
The current results of this year are noted that languages with the highest rates of existence are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved note A.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS members schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved note A in the higher studies, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will no doubt be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are today regarded as electoral courses as the STEM (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons which employers named for the problems of occupational jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessitated in preparing young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open jobs require languages, these knowledge are essential in a globalized world.
Depending on the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage by such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multi-lingual people will automatically provide a preliminary step in front of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak any foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15%).
For this reason it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children speaking several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, in independent schools, a number of languages with corresponding specialized teachers will always be chosen.
Scotical independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, as the future still looks.
At that time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellentness.
I'll get the bees fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James arrives for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the front season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet firm.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably just play a few minutes.
Early this week, James was asked after training for his plans for the six games of Lakers' fore-season play plan.
“I don’t need pre-seasonal games in this phase of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trumps Advertising in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts today's evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaigns.
This is the first advertisement planned by Trumps five for the next week, including well-minded places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the swollen vote on confirmation of his choice for the vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the next half-time elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk to lose control of the convention.
When will Trumps advertise tonight take place in West Virginia, and how can you view online?
Trumps' advertising in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's advertisement in West Virginia below as a live stream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably respond to the hearings of the Board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on accusations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted this week in an excited atmosphere. The expected senate vote on confirmation remains up to a week in the sweeping while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this announcement series is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaigner against Reuters stated that these five announcements serve to mobilise volunteers and attendants in the next week, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the Representative House.
“The control of the Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible while the operational election season is approaching”, said a Trump-Walf Speaker, who would not call his name, to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the advertising attendants from Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate and report media from Pittsburgh for this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are investigated.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to try to give him up in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, Politologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows fighting willingness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three unilateral rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrant pendel of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment of their view now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now there are four, I think that means a little moment for us,” said Jordan Spieth at leaving the playground.
Europe is of course in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve more follows.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel a little wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was absurdly strong from cutting to green and goes forward with a good example.
The boyural enthusiasm cries were higher in the course of his round when he lowered an important put to decide the fourth match with four points for both for themselves, after he and Thomas had left for two holes with two points.
His put, who decided the match on 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that makes it clear that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game,” said Spieth.
That's all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood as the only player in the last two days have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple that had not beaten Bogey on Saturday noon, but they also had avoided the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the behind nine holes on Friday morning Bogey’s.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the outgoing quantity understood that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who enseal a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, speaking of European glory would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning playing with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a crush that they couldn't overcome nearly.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the crush.
The four and four pairs, due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change quickly, are so fascinating from nearby.
To date, Europeans have played better as a team and are clearly in leadership on the last day. However, this four-round round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, had doubted.
Europe is leading on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the fourth and fourth parties from Saturday to the United States, Europe is at 10:6 and goes with a solid prestip on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genius playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories over the tiger woods that were difficult to fight and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team mentioned by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the four in the morning against the defective American crew and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not recover the rest.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve played individuals on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won as the first European newling four points in success, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend “Melliwood”, won only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they had beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourths, they harmonized excellently and struck the enchanted Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more stressful 5&4.
Woods, who had swooped through two matches on Saturday, sometimes made his brillance flash, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four matches and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fourth morning, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, the number one and three of the world.
However, for Europe, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, it did not go all the way in its views.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring lake for the Americans on Saturday.
In the fourth, they achieved a tight 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fourth parties 4&3 after they had lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a remnant of four points. However, as a title holder, it is enough for Furyk's crew to keep the trophee.
After they have only been on the second place for two days, it doesn't seem as if they could start a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korean Foreign Minister said that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust with the United States, and that the country would not, under these circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken “of good will significant measures”. For example, it has stopped nuclear and missile tests, cut off the nuclear test site and has committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not at all refrain from one side first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach in the denuclearisation, where North Korea would be rewarded for suczessive steps, his statement seemed to be so significant as it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the outset as it had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. Kim had promised to work on the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, while Trump promised warranties for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks an official end of the Korean war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngjang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for a loosening of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States stands on “first denuclearisation” and increases pressure by penalties in order to achieve their goal by force, and are even against the “Declaration of the End of War”, said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain spine of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not take into account plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US Head of State had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean Head of State, Moon Jae-in, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea, instead of the United States, had the other party in the Denuclearisation question, the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been able to stand this stop."
Yet, the sound of Ris speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles to the vast country of the United States, after "the wicked President" Trump Kim had described as "raketerman" for suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, rose Kim with praise to the United Nations for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that there was a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – does not matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
On Thursday, however, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Sanctions of the Security Council must in any case continue forcefully until we have reached the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to remove Pjöngjang's programmes for nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngjang again next month in order to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on the departure from Pjöngjang that progress had been made to be accused of only hours later by North Korea, he made "passing-like demands".
North Korea commended this month at a moon meeting, a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took "consistent measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" aimed at were security guarantees given to Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year at primary study. This is a measure against the widespread machiculture to stay alert with caffeine and to learn over the whole night.
A scientist has found that the students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes that he is the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course into life after he had held a lecture on the impact of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I learn of it only now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me." he said to The Telegraph.
The course that takes place this year for the first time explained to the students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporty performance and also improve the general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and business director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it had found that students suffered severe sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee cupcakes, covers, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep shortages on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university site, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routines with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision on smoking affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride that a "suspension of the night" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made the sleep deficiency a growing problem.
In order to ensure adequate sleep, all students should be the "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight increase could be avoided, as sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, and he had completed one of his courses last year in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before they start their study at the Competitive University.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should have a wake-up for sleep and awakening time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that is based on electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the tach. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outdoor game when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimously playing team meant a 0:1-degradation at Livingston.
The Ibrox crew wanted to book its first outward victory since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team has left eight points behind the hearts leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half time, and the inspiration arms of Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is just behind Hibernian at the Tordifference.
The Rangers also threatens further disturbance after liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr obsolete and reached the halffinale of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who lost the hearts a point last week, and should be enthusiastic as his well trained team kept their opponents under pressure on step and step.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
You should have reached a gate after just two minutes when Mengas first issued Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot.
Then a long release from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot by the back pepper.
The Rangers took over control, but their game seemed more hopeful in the last third than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was evidently of the opinion that after a quarter, he should have been inflicted because of a collaboration between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers only arrived in the first half of the time, but the former Ibrox Torhüter Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a tender shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's meeting in the 34th minute may not match the game history, it is not denied that they deserved him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a long standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple grade.
Gerrard acted at half time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player Morelos took place, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game they had, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's crew could have expanded its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a sentence after a lot of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the pond counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the geiger counter.
Since then, the geiger teller became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to “see” defective cells
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system to “see” and destroy defective cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to identify defective cells during treatment.
The method is used to extract immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can see a lot of cancers of common protein and then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect defiled cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is used to extract immune cells that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancer protein HER2. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", including breast-, egg-stock, lung- and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a leukaemia type.

Kanye West was built in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he had praised high-speed US president Donald Trump and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had sung his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a shocking canonade against the democratics and once again emphasized his support for Trump.
“I am as often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He is a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the mission with a Sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of Wests Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
In addition, the West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage for his head covering.
“They chocked me behind the stage.
You said, 'Don't go out with the cap.'
You chocked me!
And then they say I'm in a descending area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Will you see the diminished area?” He said that he would “attract my supermancape, because that means that you cannot tell me what I have to do. You want to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments at least two times caused buh calls from the audience, and SNL colleagues were embarrassed, reports Variety. One person said to the magazine: “It became deadly in the studio.”
West had been committed late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love it", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, and twittered: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you, that you have had the machete against you."
However, the Talkshowmoderator Karen Hunter twittered that the West was simply he himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes a harmful ideology for my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us." added her.
Before the mission, the Rapper had announced to Twitter that he had changed his name and was now “The Being formally known as Kanye West” (the officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His raper colleague Snoop Dogg carried the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the dead music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then in “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince” (the formerly known as Prince).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxic males
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs by violent medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
However, the 31-year-old actress attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would have led to the feeling that boys would often have to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic males in the #MeToo times.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also involved in Game of Thrones, also 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was “very important”.
“I personally think the question is very important at the moment what has gone wrong with maleness,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing? ”
Harington believes that due to the very masculin character, television may partly be responsible for increasing toxicity.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives a boy the feeling to have to represent this certain side of a man?
I think that is really one of the major questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men have clearly been wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in prequels or sequences by “Game of Thrones” and he had “enough of battlefields and horses”.
From November Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's “True West”, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that he was the best of Game of Thrones that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow, with many emmys.
They were married to Leslies family property in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the majority of the new cases through sexual traffic.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way has almost been reduced to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yuntan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an urgent problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of members of the LGBT community is supposed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV drugs to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters contradicts that employees have made the data of the GOP sensors dilute, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the US Representative House, argues on Saturday that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three republic US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The Democrat of Los Angeles believed that the claims of “ultra-righted” experts and websites would be distributed.
“Liars, liars and more horrible lies,” said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The published information should contain the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the charges raised against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh of sexual failures by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators Kavanaugh had consulted.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of contributions, was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie”, Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the filling of these information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ Declaration prompted online criticism, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementia is angry," wrote flesh.
“This makes it clear that she does not have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You can't be defenceful.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You must be quiet and left."
Meaters seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the democratics to judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a republic candidate who arrives in the half-time elections to resolve waters, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if it is true," he twittered.
Waters said in its statement that their office informed the competent authorities and criminal prosecutors about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the transgressors are revealed,” she continued, “and they will be brought to account for all their actions which are devastating and dangerous for all members of my staff.”
Criticism of “Johnny English – One only lives three times” – weak spionage parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to search for Brexit references in any British-colored new film. This also seems to apply to this re-experience of the "Johnny English" French action parodie, which started in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion, who started it" and, in 2011, with "Johnny English – Now only right" stuttering again.
Will an ironic self-parodie on the subject of how evidently we are foolish become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema seekers in the non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the cracked secret agent, who considers himself bizarrely cool and worldly human, while in reality he has contributed a single note to the title melodie of “The hour of the winner” in London at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in 2012.
In addition, the figure originally was based on the chaos that left behind travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval army, and the rotor leaves were shortly tied to his helmet.
Atkinson's ability for physical comics is arising, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely overflowing, especially because the “serious” series of films such as “007” and “mission Impossible” are now offering self-safe Comodontic elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English' crazy misconducts are not as impressive and focused as Atkinson's stupid film gags in the role of the Bean.
The everlasting premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the supersecret British spying network and revealed the identitys of all British agents in use, very to displease the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strohhalm for the Prime Minister, a blow-up and stressed figure that already stands before the complete crash because of her political in popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much to her that she can work with
Their Secret Service Advisors inform them that all active spies have been defiled and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpathetic Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sensible institution but is inofficial in the work of undercover agent. There are a few Gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" spy academy.
English is brought back to a emergency meeting to Whitehall and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot Commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are in action again. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously involved in the ban of a charismatic Tech-milliardary, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to resolve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the big-sized spots: As a kneller dresses, they burn a nice French restaurant, they care for chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English tries to make pure anarchy known by means of a virtual reality headset with the inner of Voltas house.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as well, the topic is already discussed in the children's television.
A fairly moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, ‘Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really justifies his talent? ’
Labour strives to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is intended to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week but pay for five days.
According to reports, the party wants business managers to forward the savings obtained by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country in favour of the workers.
The transition to a four-day week was favoured by the Trades Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to use the benefits of the changing economy.
A high level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to recovering the economic balance in favour of workers and with the General Industrial Strategy of the Party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not at present support the approach.
A speaker of the Labour Party said: "In a 4-day week it is not party policy and it is not considered by the Party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concreted his view of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was firmly determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The shadow cancellator's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retire their entire share as a laboratory government could take action due to suspected misconducts.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans for calling workers into corporate boards and setting up Inclusive Ownership Funds in order to transfer 10 % of the capital of private companies to the employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy commented in the news magazine "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the case of Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has deferred a final vote on his appointment to Judge at the Supreme Court of Justice by at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority might affect republic senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minutes' correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could give you something to do, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told in the negotiation that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was expressed, and I asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and indispensable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be measured in stone.
“My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to place a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has controversed this phenomenon," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called it couldn't confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't detect any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty during this festival?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York to combat an annual music festival with an impressive lineup on stars and an impressive mission – to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the appearances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to sharpen the consciousness of the actual objective of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012 for the first time, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. In the context of this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to combat poverty by increasingly motivating people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To receive a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens are still 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of bringing a cool free concert in view, a meaningful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if you think to change something by signing a online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global Citizens informed that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and achieve various objectives.
These actions are supposed to have helped lead politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars were already paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers with seat in the United Kingdom, who have committed to supporting children in their optimum development and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars fight undernutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 actions in which Britain was invited to improve the dietary situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, the question of what are the reasons why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they answered: “There will be a long and hard way with heights and depths.
But, like the major civil rights and anti-partity movements in front of us, we will be successful, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that are taking place during this year's event in New York. It also includes Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderns.
The United States could use the Navy for blocking purposes to disabled Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington is able to resort to the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the US Indian Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is an intention to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently invited to the legal government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official there are means and ways to deal with this.
“The United States can, together with the Marine, ensure that the seaways remain open, and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he informed.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, who understands itself as the “time of electricity users” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said while he described Russia as “One Trick Pony” with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquid gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unexposed" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the "catching" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-pipeline value of 11 billion US dollars, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has invited the United States to avoid the EU's energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country is interfering with our energy supply," the BDI Dieter Kempf's Board comments after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Wladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate for 2020 “examinely” says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considers a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and this includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine" a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump guides this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very worried about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren took no leave in the mouth when he criticized Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course a FBI investigation was required.
However, a Thursday survey showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be candidate for 2020.
According to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential choosers in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be announced.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for the former Governor Deval Patrick's candidateship, with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidate, and 48 percent in favour of it.
The other names of prominent democracies, which are eligible for a possible candidate for 2020, include the former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden informed that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin comments on the Donald Trump-Ralley on posttraumatic disturbance, under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son suffers, what he suffers when he comes back, all that can empathize other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and part of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she informed the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "Elephant in the space" and said about their son and other war veterans that they came back changedly, that they would come back more abruptly, that they would come back and wonder if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a woman for domestic violence, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police department of Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support a legal assistance to the new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the district of Columbia support a legal assistance to the new US policy that refuses victims of band activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and the District received a judicial declaration on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who questioned politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace Contra-session-Klage, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, was not announced.
She informed that her partner “and his violent band sons” abused them, but US officials rejected their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutors who support Grace named El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations who have to fight with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on their flight from domestic violence.
The General Federal Advocate of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at state, federal and international level”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications are assessed based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the application, and that court contradicts this principle” was stated in the Court’s Explanation.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the declaration that the policies that immigrants refuse to access to the country have a disadvantaged impact on the US economy, as immigrants could rather be active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour forces.
In June, General Federal Advocate Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges who fled from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands would no longer grant asylum.
“Asyl are there for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction,” said sessions in its announcement of politics of 11 June.
It was never the plan to expose all the problems by asylum, even all serious problems that people have to fight with every day worldwide.
Depressed rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race is doubled with time
For survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
“It’s all very excited,” says 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fevering son in a rescue center in the destroyed centre of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is short."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their neat possessions and goods and to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the staff of hospitals who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who caught spinal fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated in the outer part of the area because of the persistent strong aftercrews.
With tears in his eyes, he told us how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It went too fast.
I think I was embedded among the walls that came in," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“ I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then I was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Messenger appeals to China to the Tyrannei with “Propaganda advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had launched a four-sided ad in an American newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were announced, the U.S. Messenger in China accused the country capital of Beijing to exploit the American press for progaganda purposes.
U.S. Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most selled magazine in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6, a charge that concerns China.
Trump's charges that Beijing has tried to interfere with the US elections correspond to the communication from US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an outbreaking trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Messenger in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, who exports largely agricultural products to China, noted that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of farms and companies.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, double this tyranny now by switching propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of free expression and the independent press in America by switching the country's advertising in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast to that, you will find in the newspapers here in Beijing only in a limited number of oppositions and do not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republics screwed the voters from the interim elections with the Debakel around Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming intermediate elections, which could be based particularly on women.
The mood in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue by a vote.
“Some things can’t be undoed”, Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill, informed for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts that the last minute front of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was enough for a FBI investigation to relieve angry voters.
“Womens don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November”, said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group, according to the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the hallway area of the Senate called “November is coming” when the Republicans who control the Committee of Justice decided to hold on the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported Mic, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, informed Stu Rothenberg, an unparteious political observer of the news page.
"The people say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially for women who choose in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their accusations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a reaction could be the result if the Republicans confirm.
"This situation is a serious controversy for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
“It is not only the vote of the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it”, Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities in the United States, a group who supports the election of democracies, informed the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree who they are supposed to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or likely to give Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38 % argued that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his statement, while 30 % indicated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least one other applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week before the Senate's Justice Committee, Ford gave an oathly statement that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed its genitals to her when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, inrupt, is a company based on the open-source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee bestowed that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world rule".
"We must be active now," he said on the topic startup.

The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for private and business areas.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all contents are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and related capabilities so that Solid is available for all.
The company is currently Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for the work on this project, as well as a Community voluntary programmer. A security platform acquired by IBM is also used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange themselves with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made where all their business models will be completely transformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a new design of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was a major part of the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carryer of the Victoria Cross in the First World War, was honoured
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded as a fighter with the Victoria Cross during the First World War, was honoured in his home city 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a scarf shooter and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, believed that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his bataillon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through thick fog and strong shots of field cannons and machine weapons.
Later he approached the fireline and led the line forward with the "maximum braveness" before he speeded out three of the military units with a field weapon in the entrance.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German scarf shooter; a little more than a month before the end of war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that he could never justify, and at the same time something that makes a person humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a crane after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann argued that he was very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the braveness of a real hero is to be seen especially by the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The invoice of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was delivered live all night in the United Kingdom to Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not astonished when they saw peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained unconscious after they stayed awake until early in the morning to see the fight specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“On the basis of a regulation by the government, these content are considered not youthless, so that it had to be switched to a child broadcast at 6 o'clock,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Corporate Board of Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will process the final plan in order to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
“I think that the problem could already be solved during the replay game,” he said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning at one Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying there.
During the change, a lot of communication was communicated. It was pretty confused and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case, it was a problem of the government.
I promise, this won't happen again.
We will reduce it all to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual. And we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "degrade" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he has grown up with the feeling of being underlying all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became father, the victory in the Olympic Games are no longer so important for him.
The actual moderner of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses sickness for a few months.
In the first mission of Laverne, he said that he previously regarded himself as less than others, since the love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of subduing others and being different from the others is reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this subject because he is happy to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-fold world champion was in love with the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of being in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that when you were a child and a teenager, he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died three years later in cancer, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, everything had been about gold medals with him.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearby death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, since he wanted to be there.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he was not indefeated,” he continued.
The next year Daley won the Bronze Medal in the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream of dyking at Olympic games before the local audience – that was the madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in the front of the Olympic games and still made care of gans skin.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to try very hard so that it doesn't become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the event, the five-fold Majorman spent his day on fireing others and working on his game in the hope of fixing the problems that burden him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National Gulf Square, where misleaded balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not discouraged enough, Mickelson in the ninth game on Sunday meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined with Tommy Fleetwood, Newling in this tournament, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans place a hot start with four points of residue in the 12 individual games, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said confidently to Mickelson and couldn't add much to it.
“He was perfectly aware of his role today in clearness, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said that he was ready for tomorrow”, said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I hadn't thought he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it's going, and that's what we've expected.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most Ryder Cup games delivered on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a rider cup railway that never completely matched the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half hours, although Furyk told that his presence has already enriched the team alone.
“He is funny and sarcastic, original, and he likes to make a few bitches, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him this week.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows out of experience that a great advance that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become a unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but only came closely across the target line and went into leadership with the smallest possible predecline and won a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great precursor in Valderrama, we had a great precursor in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won but barely,” said Bjørn (pictured on the photo), after he had seen the victory 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow it's going to be right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the advertising table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and just there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what is opposite us: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance of his players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overthrow this.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are in the forefront and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things work well, but if you're out there alone, you're tested up to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get out of his own best."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart over Jim Furyk will ensure that his players cut off individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of the big turners on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner's side before standing on the sides of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the moment strikes in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to pick up for the counterfeit, he must join in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rank list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest fregatte of the German Navy should have been served in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years of the Cold War. However, it is delivered according to local media due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs only at the earliest next year.
The launch of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the headship of the brand new fregats of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, was now moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time of a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service already in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems was plagued after the delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old fregats of the Bremen class.
They are intended to contain a powerful cannon, a number of flight defence missiles, and sea target aircraft, as well as tarn technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregats do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays may lead to the expiry of the high-modern warships that are intended to represent Germany as a maritime force at the time of their entry into force, says The Time.
The Fregatte F125, which was followed by accident, got into the headlines last year when the German Marine officially refused to take off the ship and returned to Hamburg by the shipyard Blohm & Voss.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little known about the reasons for return, but German media called a series of significant "software and hardware errors" which would have made the new ship unusable in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Marine from implementing restructuring measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" seemed to be twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in the second world war.
In addition to the defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, were also a problem.
It seems that the cost increased to a breathtaking €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregats are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that the sea forces of Germany are shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, defendant of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Navy “outgoes the ability to operate ships”.
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, since old ships were taken out of service, but no substitute ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Fregatten of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken off by the Marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the Fledermouses
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research will be carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will trace dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and water bats in Invereve Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are set up at key positions on the ground to record the activities of the bats during the whole season.
Personnel of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
A noise analysis of all recordings by experts determines the frequency of the bats calls and determines what species is doing.
Afterwards, a map and a report of the living area are drawn up in order to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Natural Protection Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine and demonstrate the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of pastures, how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The Fledermous stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom have fallen significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, like flying catchers and chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cats.
Fledermouses are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced ecotype to detect insects and obstacles in their railway.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of the bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only Fledermaus reserve in Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Goods Manager David Thompson explains that the possession of the ideal living space is for her.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living area.
But there are many things we do not know about bats yet, so we do these work here and on other goods that will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel well."
It stresses the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nestplace could kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire local population.
Fledermouses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We have to learn much about bats, and in many of our species we don’t know what their populations are.”
Ronaldo argues rape, while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape assaults against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to “be famous” by the use of his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The storms of the Portuguese National Team and Juventus Turin were accused of rapeing a American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence for the incident, said The mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video on his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports as “Fake News” only hours after their publication.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News," said the five-fold winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse the mirror on the basis of the accusations that they, according to Reuters, referred to as "inappropriate reporting on suspects in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a damage replacement for “moral damage in a height that corresponds to the severity of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The claimed event was supposed to have occurred in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After they had met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to have gone into the player's room, where he had rape them, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the supposed incident Ronaldo went to the knees and she said he was "99 percent a good guy" which was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later joined an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “fear of revenge” and was concerned to be“publicly degraded”.
The 34-year-old said that they are now trying to abolish the agreement because it was still traumatized due to the claimed incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the claimed incident and this summer changed into a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repentant forever’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “repentate forever” if it lost its status as a world leader manufacturer of cars after Brexit, says Minister of Economic Affairs, Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was “awning” that Toyota UK told BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production in Burnaston's work at Derby, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer argued that the impact of delays at the border on a no-deal break could lead to the loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis were produced, finished almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March”, says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager in Burnaston.
Other British automobile manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised fears of a hard EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that it will close his mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are associated with risks within the supply chain with a hard brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a “Just-in-Time” basis. This means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and the EU to complete the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and breakdowns in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to operate in Derbyshire for a stock that was longer than one day, the company explained why production would have to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such controls at the border".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I said, enables us not only to enjoy the current success but also to take this opportunity”, he explained in the BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota was unable to indicate how long production should be interrupted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been busy in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functionary of the Unity Faculty, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs never come back when they are gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meeting with Rosenstein could be reset, according to the White House's information
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be “for another week” while the dispute for the Candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the work of special detective Robert Mueller, who examined Russia's election interferences, the connections between Trumps consultants and Russia, as well as the president's possible disability of justice.
The question whether Trump fires the Ministry of Vice-Justice and thus threatens Mueller's independence has been subject to rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of a secret record of his conversations with Trump and the President's official resolution using the 25th constitutional supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed retirement became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at this time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but the meeting was then suspended in order to avoid conflicting with the hearing before the US Legal Committee, where both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had committed sexual abuse to him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps Press Speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
She answered a question about Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set, but it may be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be shifted by another week, in view of all the things that are just taking place with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the running."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has no longer held the White House press conference since 10 September.
Mother Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences does not ignore the “effect hackery” of the TV reporters, but admitted: “I would not dispute that they are acting in effect hackery.”
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would grow.
The President makes more question-and-response rounds than any President before him," she explained, without proofing, "We have looked at these figures."
There will still be press conferences, however, as Sanders says, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly but far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this frequently and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting hosts.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he gave a riding and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes because of Brexit's concerns about EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The health minister is addressed to persons from abroad working in Scotland National Health Service (NHS) in order to express the country's appreciation and to express the desire that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom expired from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to charge the costs of applications for residence titles for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the course of the summer, the departure negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government also strengthened the preparations for a possible No-Deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to say again how much I value the contribution of each person, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and also provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you were staying here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected after a head injury to an emergency surgery
The Tennessee State Tiger's linebacker Christion Abercrombie, according to the information by Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subject to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head trainer of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just broke down there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before he was put on a wire and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet details about the nature or extent of the injury" are known and tennessee state is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he switched over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom in the future. The additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step will end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects more than 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will now announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, where the added income will benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to impress Jeremy Corbyn's success with young choosers who promise to provide more affordable living rooms and to take top earners into the vision.
The increase in stempel tax will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax, including the increase in two years ago on two-houses and rental housing property, the surcharge is raised could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected by the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. Thus the prices are driven up and it becomes more difficult for first buyers to take foot in the real estate shop.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "spiritual cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers, most of the time spent outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson expressed a reduction in the stempel tax in order to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies to maintain real estate prices by purchasing land without using it, and he urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the "residential shame" of Britain.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting number of proposals for reforms of living spaces, which are sufficient from a rental price commitment to the prohibition of rooms without reason.
He also wants to give city trees more powers to build new apartments.
May explained: “I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British Dream, which would improve the life of generation to generation.
And that means to repair our broken apartment market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be correct that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for companies with seat abroad to buy property as well as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the invaluability of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, Chief of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘great goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at any time.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of entering the United Nations from the North East of England, which is just on the third place in the League One and lacks the three points at the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to go to the bank and that was 's'," said Ross of the BBC Scotland sports sound.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden and this is something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I would be successful in the association management."
Ros's predecessors in Sunderland's role include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to join the footsteps of such etablished names in such a club after he previously rejected offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will now be measured by whether I can bring the association back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and the possibilities of this association, he no doubt belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I'd probably only appreciate my time as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can present a only three-year management career, after a phase as vice-president at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real divorce," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I did not get bad, could live well of it, and some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to be through every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so well in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer missed the revenues of British crises pubs, while restaurant chains were under bigger pressure.
Pub and bar companies reported a sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, the incomes in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA Corporate Consultation, which compiled the figures, explained: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the soccer world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June in which the pub’s turnover increases of 2.8 per cent.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed with distance the best performance, with an area-adjusted turnover development that increased higher than they fell at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food were also in the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems that the people were just trying to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, analytists for the RSM recreational and hosting industry, explained: “This results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the biggest factors for turnover in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight with problems, but sales revenue of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year, in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food, and it would still be waiting for the more temperate temperatures to provide the urgently needed atmosphere in August."
The total turnover growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in the brand rollouts.
The industry turnover monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant area in the United Kingdom collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keeps it secret to parents and teachers
A survey among 20,000 students in secondary schools has observed an increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message gives rise to anxiety that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "main account" to show it to their parents.
One of five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it secret to adults.
A survey among 20,000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase in the so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a lecture to the Photo Sharing website Instagram.
The message gives rise to anxiety that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to “rape me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, and half admitted to possessing private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, explained: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are led to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes “Stimme of the Sports” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Association of Scotland's Light Athletics Council at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding light athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports operators to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the light athlete community of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world and we are sure that light athlete in Scotland would benefit very much from its choice in the Council”, said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and guide sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 in the Olympic Games in Atlanta, named four Olympic Gold Medals, and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me whether or how far I'm going to be healed.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to run again and do movement exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
A advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A producer of milk pumps provided an excitement in the network with a advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to the milking of cows.
In order to introduce the market, according to the ‘World-World-World-Raise Larable Milk Pump’, the manufacturer of Consumer Technology Elvie published a not very seriously meant music video in order to emphasise the freedom to give the pump breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shark filled with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines such as: “Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a dick at me” or “If you don't notice it, it's not a jute but my breasts.”
The Refrain continues: “Pumps it out, pump it out, I feed the babys, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has caused a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions with the audiences, many of whom say that it has harmlessly the “terrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
As we do, they must be pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days after birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits in a Still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “After-dropable traumatic for mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “So a reality stranger advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urkomical".
“I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
When I pumped, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertising aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or toilets) and feel like “cows”.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie's pump is totally noiseless, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a Still-BH, thus giving women the freedom to move, to keep their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, explained: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a vigilant and provokative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the challenges involved, at the same time presenting the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-fold mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly brought into a tent city at the Mexican border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things, since reinforced rhetoric and measures by the Trump Government have made it more difficult to spend children with maintainers.
Traditionally, most of the maintainers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even a target disc for exposure when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household had to issue their fingerprints and that these data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a high official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Customs Authority, declared before the convention that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unmarried minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of arrested persons had no previous records in the criminal register.
“Most 80 percent of those who are either self maintainers or members of a household of a maintainer stay illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," explained Albence.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children faster, the officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, required to appear before the court within one month rather than 60 days after the arrest, which was the standard.
Many will appear by video switching and not personally to come before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person will be quickly disposed of.
The longer these children remain in caution, the more likely it is, according to the details of accommodation employees and reports that have been known from the system in the last month, that they are worried and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems are easily ignored due to the size.
They also explained that it could strengthen the trauma, which many of the children already suffer, if they were brought to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘managing forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, declared that the foreign armies are illegally treated on Syrian ground with the pretext of the fight against terrorism and are ‘dependently treated’.
“You must retire immediately and without condition,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of other people have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred struggle until all Syrian areas are cleaned” by both terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mainly training and advising both Kurdish armies and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soil troops in the war preserved country.
As regards refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for their return were set and he accused “some western countries” to “disperse irrational fears” to prevent refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return to the home,” he explained.
"They are politicians of a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that there was no support for the construction of Syria until there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large Rebellenhochburg Idlib represents the possibility of promoting political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide offensive of Syrian armies supported by Russia to the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed its hope that military measures against Dschihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which is connected with Al-Qaeda, will be carried out.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to invite the first meetings of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to simplify the way to elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and declared that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win its re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, end his Presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a Presidency of all times”.
There are no signs of being satisfied by the viewers.
Since 2014, the circulation rates at the best time for CNN have doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC to 1.6 million have almost tripled.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of sending, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” led to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that people wear magically because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama "Designed Survivor" series on TV-sender ABC on a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an ancient Comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a few hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi tour in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘for he brings me to laugh’,’ said Scovell to me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington can, in contrast to everything that can be found on television, determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Turn off is a luxury that only the privilegedest viewers can afford.
And yet, it will be an informed citizen if you are aware that you have already seen a six-hour expert round of Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for its book "Fear", Paul Manaforts $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from Straußenleder (as reported in Washington Post) or the effects of Stormy Daniel's riding description of Trumps, discussed anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“A part of what he does, it can feel like a reality show that he introduces to you every evening”, says Brent Montgomery, the main business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trumps rotating occupation and daily actions (a dispute with the football liaison NFL from the gate, commend Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a consequence or you're not going with me anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he caught himself inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He could simply not resolve from the screen, not when Judge Kandidate Brett Kavanaugh was shortly ahead of proclaiming before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy missions at the time and the people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of the western civilization’,” said Fleiss.
"I thought this was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donation money flows the closest races around seats in the Congress at the interim elections
It is little surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donation funds thanks to the newly drawn borders of the electoral district, which led to two officials standing around the same seat.
The newly drawn suburb district in Pittsburg allows the Democrats Conor Lamb to enter, who won its seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly crossed with the new 17th district.
The cards were resigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were disputed against the Constitution and manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district resulted in a breakdown of election funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th district of the State.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and the Trump won there with 20 percent points of advance.

The United States examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised without encountering great resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump completed a friendship meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Valero and held a hotel in Panama until partner cast out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the latest decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, ministerial spokesman at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, penalties were considered, which were estimated to be $140 million in 2017 for U.S. aid, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wish the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now appointed as speaker at the conference set up at mid-October to put a sign of the importance of the congregation government, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new notices or criminal actions from Washington.
A government speaker by John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to express themselves on internal discussions under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by one external analysiser close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the special detective Robert Mueller on the Trumps of possible judicial disability for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now claims to examine whether Trump's electoral team with Russia has conspired in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of conventions change, Trump is confronted with an organ that forces him to be accountable, exactly at the time when he travels by to come back before the voters; and perhaps before a jury jury.
These are many 'Whens' and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps is inevitable, or that of its European Pendants.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938 German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had just resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the barbarians that followed.
The course of history focuses on such turnpoints and the inconsistent march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just faced with a number of such turnpoints.
What do we do when Trump releases the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein arrived in Satan's cuisine since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and speculated that he was unfit for the office.
Rosenstein dementes the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the new FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements in the office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a convention that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, a long winter is ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime once occupied my message home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to inflamme Sabbath candles on the table with the crucifix.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans by the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that after the impressive remnant against Villareal in Spain, a victory against the Austrians will move them into a good position for the qualifications of the Group G of the Europe League at the beginning of the month.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equality to Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for greater.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went to the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have won at the end, but a total dispute was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a difficult game, since they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good on it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Anxiety for age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to handle them, only a few talked to their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study reported to talk to your mates about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
“The people want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Party.
You should start with this.
Talk to your mate and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be handled, as these decisions may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Compare your legal documents: Avail disputes in last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority, so that you are responsible for a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the medicine treatment?”
Who cares about the dog?

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities. The number of dead should still rise.
Due to the failure of communication systems, aids were not able to obtain information from the Donggala government district, a region north of Palu, located close to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
Over 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that extends over 300 km (180 miles) long coast in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
In the government district, a administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299.200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue in the economy Central Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel degradation is also important in the province, but it focuses primarily on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami with nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami that met 14 countries and 226.000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean cost their lives, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the southern Javas, Indonesia's most populating island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and demanded nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 met the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed thousands of villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by collapseing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes met the indonesic island of Lombok, popular with tourists, and demanded more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily strolled on the island.
Sarah Palin’s son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested due to accusations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a result of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disabling of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, such a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off a friend's phone when they wanted to communicate with the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is investigated in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 deposit has been charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his pledge with “Not guilty, very sure” answered the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A infringements, which can be sanctioned with up to one year prison and a penalty of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B disorder that can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that punishment was raised against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the claimed attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, domestic violence, the disability of reporting a crime and arms possession under anaesthetic influence were submitted to him in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him to beat her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organisations in 2016 after her son's behavior resulted in a posttraumatic burden disturbance following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami by earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that the Indonesian island Sulawesi shook on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks have been interrupted and it is expected that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the coast of Central Sulawesis, located north-east of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal lawyer calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York Terror Attack
The Federal Advocate in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the prosecutor in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has not been committed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terror attack, as he traveled on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and “consciously” added serious body injuries, says the deliberate statement for the claim of the death penalty submitted in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the assault, a Federal Sustainable Court of Appeal of Saipov lodged a prosecution in 22 points, covering eight accusations of murder against the background of the organised crime, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The appropriation requires "based planning and intent", says the prosecutors, who carried out the type of action in Saipov, described as "absurd, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco to damage, pain and losses,” explains the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the Southern District of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding death penalty.
The prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a lifelong punishment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been accused two years before the conspiracy of spionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, born in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, said court documents.
He told researchers to feel good with what he did, said the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after he had watched videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also called on the police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the government defenders who represented Saipov, stated that they were “unforgivablely disappointed” due to the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a debt confession in exchange for a lifelong freedom penalty without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all the stakeholders will suffer,” said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Member of the Conservative Party calls on NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise the "power of the people" today during a protest action in the context of the Tories Conference.
The former Head of the Party of Ukip stated that politicians must “feeling the pressure” of the European shippers, while a Member of Theresa May's Party suggested that dangers should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative rear banker Peter Bone explained to the demonstrant in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “prepared” if Farage Brexit ministers were.
The challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of its deeply disputed parties was strengthened by participating in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems with keeping his compromise plan Chequers in spite of the attacks of the Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Alliances insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and therefore force European shipping officers and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'Chaos'.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the waste’.
He proposed that a peer should have been named and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he was responsible, we would already be out,’ he explained.
The Member of Wellingborough added: ‘I will admit to the Brexit, but Chequers belong to the trash.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: 'We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are chosen.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a top message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister keeping her jobs when you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians must ‘feel pressure’, they should be in the process of frauding the decision of the referendum of 2016.
‘This is now a question of confidence between us, the people, and our political class’, so danger.
‘They are trying to deceive the Brexit, and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘This is not how you come from.’
Before an enthusiastic quantity, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
‘We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which helped us to win in the referendum and will never rest until we are no independent, self-administrating, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour announcement in the city center.
A few activists swept the Banner of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, Adonis says.
'This is a farce.
There's just no good Brexit', he added.
Warren intends to ‘examine’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would “examine the presidential candidate”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.
Warren, an outstanding critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican Members of the House of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice Chairman of Trump's Champ in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculations that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trumps official accession.
One of the attendants asked her if you would like to candidate for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government, and this includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in the case of deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that had arrested the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at Eastern Time.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to see on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Campus of the Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and died as a result of this injury,” explained the 247sports of the police head Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, according to the sports media portal.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been at the crime and possession of a weapon and shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any further incidents and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.

Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in the Qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Steel orders of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost like he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and made Hamilton travel at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but after a hard wheel-to-rad maneuver, where the Ferrari pilot resolved the inside to endure with the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstapen started on one of the back spots of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then for a large part of the race the fastest, since he held on his tyres to close quickly and get Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the 44th round and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while the Raikon ended as a fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri gave the whole weekend an excellent performance and how a real gentleman acted when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really poor body language
President Donald Trump was funny at a election event on Saturday on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who endured the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which they proposed sexual abuse not to the press to the candidate of the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford was not directly addressed to the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that the actions in the Senate showed that people are “common, malicious and dishonest”.
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has taken place in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and malicious and malicious and dishonest," said the President.
“ If you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... You published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, wait a minute.
If we have it... no, we haven't published it," he added by imitating the voice of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July, and he was published in early September. However, Finstein disputes that the leak came from their office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I did not publish your story,” explained Finstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secretity."
Their dementia seemed to be not good at the president, who said on Saturday night at the election event: “I tell you one, this was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defence of the Judge's candidates, who are being accused of sexual abuse by three women, claimed that the democratics would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all means.
One sees the commonness, the evil, they don't care for who they hurt when they get hit under the wheels to maintain power and control," said the President, mediaite.

Flyers died after he was sure that hundreds of people in a plane escaped from the earthquake
A flyer in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death in order to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shocked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong squads are still to be seen in the region and many people are caught under ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the startway at the time, could be removed safely.
Then he ran out of the Tower when he thought he would crash.
Respect later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead may rise to several thousands. The country's disaster protection authority declared that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the ruins, while others cannot be achieved”, said the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is short.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy now, but it could become much worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a talk before the military of the country: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
"Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shocked this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports now of a missing fly crash in Lagune
The airline that operated the flight, which fell into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the descending plane.
Air Niugini explained in a communication that they cannot say anything about the remaining of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The Airline claimed to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The Airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane was crashed into water when trying to land on the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline argued that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact expiry of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the Lagune just before the railway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane was flying out of the railway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane arrived very smoothly.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wave through hip depth water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight companions were screaming and screaming and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that seafarers working close to the improvement of an installation site hurried with a blowable boat to help to bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data of the Aviation Security Network can be found that 111 people have died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerns Air Niugini.
Analytist reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charge ended her proofing in the re-debate of a case in which a man was accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analytist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was in the evening of her death with Chambers. This is contrary to his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period when he indicated that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to the witness status on Saturday and said that he was not in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he indicated that he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known two weeks at their death date.
But mobile records indicated that they knew themselves for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers died, Tellis left their news, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has cut them out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pledoyers on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is next to the jury this day.

Another black?!
New York Child Girl accuses couple for a release after “racist” SMS
A New York child girl accuses a couple because of a discriminatory release, after receiving a misleaded message from the mother, in which they complained that she was “another black”.
The couple argued to be racist and compared the dispute with a “expression”.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her astonishment when she found out that the new daily mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEIN, OTHER SCHWARZ,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognising her Fauxpas, the “shamefully touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released and claimed that the open African daymother had done bad work and, instead, she expected a Philippines, the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent with a Uber home.
Now Maurice charges the couple for compensation for the release and claims a compensation for the $350 per day, which they claim for over six months, the job for which they had been booked originally, but without a contract, and for which they had lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do this,” she explained the newspaper on Friday, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism assaults, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended them, to no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a “expression” and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“You want such a person to be interested?
This is not very nice," added the Investment Banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple was promptly condemned in the public and insulted on the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put into someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our modern knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, had been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was “sweet.”
She explained that your father was in secret proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as a “very important family member”.
"He was a very silent man and didn't cry," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice 2, where the doctors in vain tried to save their lives.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that she gave to her doctors to keep her heart on pumping sounded slowly and left her body.
She had just died and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to crack up."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieved for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who didn't get anything of what she was going through, went on the plane.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my wings all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang on maps to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family by a suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hooked up on a bridge in Wales Cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for advisory offices.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel as I feel every day, ” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smiles could light a room."
However, he announced his job before his death as he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014 Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say he felt depressed or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the depth. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to pass through: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the sweeping while the FBI starts investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for, i.e. a timely and limited investigation, then we might be able to get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his republic supporters not want investigations from the FBI?
Their opposition can be based on timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans, as expected, cut badly, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on voting equality and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors ‘sink’ under Kim
Since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, the number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has fallen to power, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-zuug, who is called on data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, explained that last year 1127 overruns were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pjöngjang did not express it publicly.
The major majority of the northern surrounders are eventually offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul indicates that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flies across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the survivors rather than illegal immigrants than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still technically in the state of war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State in Pjöngjang met for discussions that were about the denuclearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclear Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American penalties for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm us first unilaterally," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the Supreme Court office
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi's Representative House called the judge's candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and said that he was characteristicly unqualified for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emphasized emotionally all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed closely and stood out in tears shortly before when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the democratics in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated call murder", organised by liberals who were wrathfully lost by Hillary Clinton's presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as it shows that he was predominant to democracies.
“I think he has even declared himself unfair with these statements and the way he moved about the Clintons and the Democrats,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to destroy Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the democratics should win the majority in the representative house.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judges," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge at the Bundesrufgericht in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued that as a democratic she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the principle decision of abortion Roe v. Wade, as he is estimated as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
“We do not need a hysterical, predominant person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ach is not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a gun.
It is a sincere hatred speech, months and years of overcooking anger, and it does not get it out without crying.
"We weep when we get angry," said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying even if she became angry but developed a technique. If she becomes angry and begins to cry, she said to the person she said: “You might think that it is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just keep talking.
I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is a former job, in a office dominated by men, where I one day wept due to an incredible anger and was pulled into a staircase by an older woman, a chilled manager for whom I was always a little afraid.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"You don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, a Congress Officer from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was taken on board a ship named Monkey Business in an unmarried affair and then withdrawn his candidateship, the deepest frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider not even the idea of the presidential candidate.
“This wasn’t a well-considered decision,” she told me 30 years later with a smile.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow white and the seven dwarfs’.
Since the campaign had already been advanced, it was behind the purchase of funds and she sweared not to announce if it had not to get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported their campaign with $250.
“Do they think I get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced no official campaign to start, she was so overwhelmed of her emotions, appreciability for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the purchase of funds and direct addressing of the voters instead of the delegates so difficult, and the anger of sexism, so overwhelmed that she was near the tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my grave stone.
"She wept?"
Why Beijing could benefit from trade war between the United States and China
The opening ointment of the trade war between the United States and China was ear deaf. Although the battle is not yet a long time ago, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he proved important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new punishment duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing hit back in the same way each time and raised recently punishment duties from five to ten percent on American goods at a value of $60 billion.
China sweared to answer any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be stumbling.
To move Washington to the immigration would mean to give up. However, a public knicking to the USA would be too shameful for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that when Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war on the long term by reducing mutual dependency of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia at the thinking factory for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the over seven years of war.
In a talk before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the situation in the country improves.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he explained.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to bring normality back.
All conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures which had their goal of living and everyday life.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the desolate country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any aid linked to conditions from countries who had supported the rebellion.
Europe achieved a victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the Team USA with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his decline at the 16th railway (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten by the player with the lowest ranking in Europe team, Thorbjorn Olees from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder-Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I could not hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so unendingly happy to win back the Pokal.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to reach his landlord John Rahm, who won on Sunday 2:1 against the American Gulf-Ligging Tiger Woods in the individual meetings.
I am so incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, which I have been following in TV since my childhood," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup bilance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all times who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had all weekend problems to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-care performances throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time today tomorrow when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players gave a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
