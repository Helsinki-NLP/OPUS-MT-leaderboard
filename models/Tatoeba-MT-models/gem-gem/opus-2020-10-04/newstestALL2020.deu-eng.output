Fire removed in French chemistry
The big fire in a chemical plant that was particularly dangerous in the Northern French city of Rouen was removed. This reported the prefecture of Normandie on Friday. The fire was broken out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the event. The fire force was in use with about 200 vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called on not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shore of Seine are manufactured additives for butterfly. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people work. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when a leak broke the methanthil gas and the environment widely after faulty eggs smoked. In 2015, after an operational accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flooded into the city's waste system.
Woman announces her job to search 57 days for her missing dog
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her disappeared dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old borderer Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the dog was missing any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had paniced a dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately running out. Probably a clean thunder had moved the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days of days, "I never gave up. I never lost the hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as posthire to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flood"
57 days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie was already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her dogs stood under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flooded. The people kept on in their vehicles, went out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Army: Machinery weapons disappear spurlessly
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine weapons of type MG3 are still disappeared.
In recent years, the federal army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine weapons. The remains are in the most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "threatening" dimension.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition are disappearing - many of them have not been trackless until now. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shots ammunition. This is a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which is reported by the editorial network of Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one arms part, and 3474 shot ammunition have appeared again. Among the still disappeared weapons and parts of weapons, there are six MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. Additionally, 30 gun pipes for machinery guns of type MG3 are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Federal Army was "threatening," said the Left-Bundestag-delegated Martina Rennner. This was so much more because, in the course of investigations, little was discovered again. The left politician spoke of a "necessary balance". Renner criticized that the listing was unrecognised whether under the disappeared ammunition even those who were found in connection with the investigations against the Federal Officer Franco A. who suspected a terrorist. "And even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanks "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitely showed, the tanker sat in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was specified in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was called to wait for an official message from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" had been imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolution Guards in the Sea Road of Hormuz under the assumption of having violated security rules. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important seaways. It combines the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have intensely intensified in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tanks and drones.
Merkel deserves the courage of people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel declared the commitment of the people in the DDR who went to the street at the Peaceful Revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens brought the then DDR regime, Merkel said at a festival of the Thüringer CDU Fraction on the next day of the German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded us of the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken away," she said.
Musk seeks the delivery record
Teslas Quarteral may keep record ready. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car corporation.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car corporation with the prospect of new record numbers a strong drive to the stock exchange. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's round letters. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six digits have to be obtained in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here are the profit margins. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: Therefore we can't kite ourselves
A type of brake in the large brain prevents people from clashing themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin using experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. It also made progress in the question why children are so violently resisting the kitling, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the approach to a kitling hand triggers laughing before touching. This is on a deep layer in the large brain, which already triggers the laugh at the expectation of the kitling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats respond with "laughing" in the ultrasonic field when they are clothed by humans. This "laughing" is provided by the part of the large brain barley, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-resistance
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain between self-resistance and touching can differ from others - so people can't clot themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out at the experiments at the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the area of the large brain bark is undermined during a self-resistance. This is also the case when living beings are self-founding. During the foreign touch and the kitling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been strengthened.
However, if the self-resistance and touch of others occur at the same time, should the laugh be also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat could just not distinguish between self-resistance and touch by others. The new knowledge suggested that people could not climb themselves because the self-resistance actives a brake in the large brain.
The rats were also trained to kittle themselves, so they broke this initiative in the experiment sometimes early, showed escape behaviour or horror stars. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitling is a behavior reaction that is equal in rats and humans.
Disaster prevented: Great fire in French chemistry deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This is what the prefecture of Normandy reported to the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken out in the night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances are supposed to have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. Nobody was injured in the event. The firewear was in use with about 200 vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Inhabitants were invited not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on the speech of Boris Johnson at the first meeting in Parliament following a repeal of the forced break on Wednesday evening, and the Prime Minister threatens to carry the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not accept his demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but as he wants to achieve that is unclear.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who had used to stay in the European Union, "The best way to honor the memorial of Jo Cox and again to this country would be to carry out the EU's exit." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election campaign by a legal extremist.
Mahnmal for attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths are revealed on Saturday in Norway a feast to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron Rosen imitations. They recall the roses of thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Oslo judgment.
At the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were formed by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. It is expected to be opened among other Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinses Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first launched an autobomb in the government district of Oslo and, following the island of Utöya, thousands of participants in a holiday camp of the Youth Organization of the Social Democratic Labour Party were shot.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN General debate did not solve Iran's conflict, but now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could return to the lake. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now traveling for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. At noon the ship has left the Iranian waters. "Well it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The London Foreign Ministry called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impede the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker on 19 July under the contemplation that they had neglected the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released early September. The remaining 16 crew members would have had the circumstances accordingly well, said Hånell. They would have been professional in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company now work to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero": There was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, placed on the chain. The delivery, as a result of EU sanctions against the War Country of Syria, dispatched the authorities. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
The Iran spoke of "piratery" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutations that it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, rejected London.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important seaways. It combines the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have intensely intensified in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear dispute of both countries stands. The Americans are proposing the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States have gone out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb and should end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement in other areas. Iran is resisting the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for a military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the United Nations Full Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States, and without foreign protection powers, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is developing a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In fact, India would be predestined as a war winner. In view of the penalty duties that the US President Donald Trump imposes against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to dispose of. Financial managers of Asian companies who consider to transfer their production from China to another country call India in a survey by the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has clearly not only been involved in the inconsistencies of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pole on young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created as a result of the world's defective production chain to play a more significant role.
Now, however, India itself has been given the focus of Trumps. From the Haudegen in the Weissen House, named "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn trade benefits for 2000 products from the threshold country at the beginning of June. The United States prohibits high customs duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rivalry with India is freely representing a nearby scene. In addition, America views the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power claims in the Southern Indian Ocean. In this background, an salve of American penalty against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened These that open markets accelerate economic development in the Socialist Republic of India has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic. Also under the fashion. Its reforms are mainly aimed at the bureaucratic irrish sense, which, in the multinational state, has all too long broken up the entrepreneurial spirit. Company now gets faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a stronger insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating firms with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five fashion years, in India, economical optics have turned much to improve. However, in trade policy, this is not the case. The national conservative government even created new barriers to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the west, the modes of the Nimbus of the Energy Reformer, which re-establishes its country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary western managers like. However, the Indian First Advocate has never defended from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to disappear anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the explosion of their branches are among the tribunal choosers of Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about this short-term policy.
Placement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is to be accompanied by a report in Paris the next week. The former Head of State will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency reports AFP, calling on the family of Chiracs. It will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday a public grief celebration was held in the Paris Invalidendom, as media reported.
The competitors are brought to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of light athletics-WM
The world tip was long in the goal of playing heartwarming scenes in the cold Khalifa International Stadium. In the first stage of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swim dangerously. He could hardly hold on his legs, running in unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undermined him and supported him with the last half stage round. However, the forces were still sufficient to stop the armband clock after the destination. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly pulled the attention of the gathered journalists on himself. Sharks he just broke out, didn't want to talk about his heroic act at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only a fellow of suffering. And anyway he would be proud to represent his country that was invited to the World Association for the World War. Under normal circumstances he could not even have started. "His reason I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did that on the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought of. For this heroic thing will remain in memory. Especially Dabo even left his competitors busby in the target and voluntarily took over the last place - more than five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this precursor. At the end, it had nothing to do with, because the busby was just disqualified at the end of the world's light athletic association.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, came to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was once." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million mash: Egyptians are prepared for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in front of possible government critical protests. In the centre of Cairos, a stronger police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir spot were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and some of the phones of footgängers searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested by two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They addressed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sii, the critic of corruption and maladministration. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Spanish exile Egyptian constructors and actors Mohammed Ali, who rolled the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called on a "million march" at central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali calls for a "volunte revolution". The man is also not a "guid" for most young Egyptians because he was a subcontractor for arms millions, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase, according to two observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) were speaking of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed. The government confirmed and commented not the figures.
Random arrests
Many people had been "willingly arrested" "only because they were 'for the wrong time in the wrong place'," HRW informed arrested prisoners under appeal. The charges against the arrested were sufficient, according to their lawyers, from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the security forces were consulted and searched in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW information, willingly passengers.
HRW also criticized the censur in the North African country. Therefore, the government blocks Kairo websites and online services to interrupt further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to make returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. About 20 million returns land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way of giving back-sended products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be freed from the tax on retail donations, the Ministry declared a question of the Green Friday fraction, which the newspapers of the Radio Media Group reported on Friday, but the dealers could put the market value of the uncourse returns so low that they did not have to pay or only a few sales taxes.
Researchers at the University of Bamberg had found that the Federal Citizens returned every sixth package on the Internet when they ordered. About four percent of the products - about 20 million products - were then landed in the waste. It would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate financial donations as a turnover on which sales tax is applied.
Green-Fraction Manager Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decision that companies can not assess and donate freely to publicly useful organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This was not only valid for online trade but also for other businesses from fashion store to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is about to be confirmed.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the rehabilitation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the fundamental attitudes of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's is to be exhibited in the British capital until it is intended to be relocated on 3 October. It is estimated to EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had issued the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. At this occasion, the work called earlier "Question Time" was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently delivered a tough exchange with opposition at the first meeting of the under house after a forced break by the Supreme Court had been suspended by Johnson. Johnson wishes to carry out the Brexit already postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is mixed into the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mezzle. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily on the entry into the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "Spaziergang in the park"
The violent assaults of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opposers in Parliament, according to his top advisor, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election fight before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "Spaziergang in the Park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will (out of the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and sent them, among other things, "traiting" to the people, accusations that he could put the Members in danger because they could become a target of murder threats, he dealt with as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to peace would be if the Members would finally respect Britain's decision to leave the EU, and it would not be surprising that the people were excited about the fact that Britain had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called to hold back. "We should speak with respect," said it in an explanation. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kaschmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the United Nations again to intervene in the Kashmir Conflict at his first appearance before the Uno-Voll Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, "Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this goes bad, you hope for the best but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate each part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus strikingly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrations in Cairo call for the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government responds hardly to the present protests in Egypt. It is able to shoot the people with sharp ammunition, over 2000 assembled in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners already sitting there. Protests have never been dangerous in Egypt. However, since the acquisition of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State's device has been doing everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being embroidered by its own government drew millions to the road. And this is a problem that el-Si's regime does not get under control, regardless of how hard it is to fight against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person lives under the poverty limit in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also for the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sii. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have difficult to offer a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks in terminal: BER-Chef: No longer "Showstopper" for capital airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated featuring featuring BER fire protection works in a collaboration. Operators are satisfied with the past. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said head of the Supervisory Board of Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport Chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said that there are still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we haven't a real show stop." He assured that the timetable until the startup remains buffer.
However, there are evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction indicator is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the year, which was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects on power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for taking up the flight operation, it must continue to be worked intensively in dealing with the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the cables on which the cables are hanging. The airport manager expects it to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactory yet. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking that descends in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. Therefore 36 engines need to be exchanged. Then there should be new experiments with heat gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angles as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operated in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year since the start of 2006.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the operators plan to expand the airport. Therefore, it is to be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the Chairman of the Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance manager Heike Fölster switches to the German railway at the end of the year, Staff Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will be retired next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Drugs exploded machines - Police arrests you
He needed money for drugs - and chased a number of machines in the Chemnitzer city area! Now the transgressor is finally imprisoned!
In the past two years, the number of cigarettes and parking ticket automats in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German at the Civil Road and the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations on the production of explosions of explosives in Tat unit with a particularly severe case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had eight acts.
The police speaker: "With the prey he apparently financed his drug dependency." Four times the bomber had sprouted parking machines at the civil road between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now investigating. Police investigations continue to run against him.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group crushed its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price fight with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughters AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" reported it.
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Airhansa flight is thus de facto dissolved. The current seven Eurowings flights remain four in Vienna. It takes over the AUA from Jänner 2020 in "Wetlease", including Eurowings' Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings Jeets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Trains from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA turn cross and network planning, explained the speaker. The flight times are to be aligned on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and, on the other hand, to develop decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, your Eurowings in Vienna will be served only as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight numbers, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product was intended to be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and companions were from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight numbers are not reported in terminal 1 but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the airport of Vienna, a price struggle was broken out after the Niki court. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna was upstairs to 16 planes next summer. The Irish cheap flyer sent four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade unions as a constructor for the collective contract.
The Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary's fight attack that Lauda will have overcome the AUA in five years, responded on Friday, the AUA Board of Directors Andreas Otto: "We will remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years."
Queen-English Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now marry the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have stopped for his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced to the palace on Thursday.
"We are very happy to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so glad to begin this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," the couple, which has been together in the British media reports since October 2018, informed in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have published her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately on her Instagram account.
A royal party
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about date, location and everything else will be announced to the palace in the next few months.
But surely, the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul becomes a just as large festival as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Studies on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiac circulation diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an infarct? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and ill people.
About the analysis of heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to see the causes of heart circulation diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with €12.5 million. From Switzerland, the High Mountain Hospital of Davo belonging to the Foundation and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essentially influenceable risk factors for heart circulation diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the ones of 1000 previous patients of the Universitary heart and vascular centre at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, it was called from the Clinicum. Every year, about 200 would be added.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as precaution, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other people's diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, director of the university heart and vascular centre. New findings about interplay between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer diseases are possible.
The chairman of the Kohne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is the strong will to use the data also for researching other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos has been treating mainly allergies. Now, on the medicine campus there, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor for bioinformatics. For reasons of his commitment, the Swiss logistic operator said that he was operated in the open heart of Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The bioexamines of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, according to the Clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. When hereditary encryption is closely monitored for the protection of anonymized data, scientists insured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the heritage of a person can be decrypted today within 24 hours. The pure cost of it is EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundreds of million euros. The study is intended to begin on 1 October, and all the 9000 samples will be analyzed at the end of 2020. The first results will be expected in the year after that.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of malicious boys
In Nigeria, the police have tortured and abused more than 300 boys from a Coran School. Following instructions from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the victims of less-year-olds, as police speakers Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the precaution of being instructed in the Koran and "beared". In fact, the protectors of their teachers were held under "the most devastating and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. Some hundred pupils, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Coran School reported that the information had been available for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, Sabo said. They would not have known about the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In most of the Muslim North of Nigeria there are many private Coran Schools. They replace the often inadequate government institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to UN refugee aid, over 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring State of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in the north of Nigeria have liberated almost 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some of them had visible injuries suggesting torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after an indication in a islamitic school. The conditions there were "human insignificant". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the release action.
The children, all boys, had been held in their school as slaves and were placed on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed degraded and injured students in a obviously bad health condition.
World football selection: further accusations after Messis and Klopps Cür
Football "not valid signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa draws out the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After declaring that Nicaragua's captain had never voted at the World Footballer election, there were accusations from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not at all evaluated - with a curious reason.
Many things in the Fifa have proved to be intrigued in recent years: the WM forgiveness, dubious plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Footballer choice has not been suspected of uncleanness until now - if you fail to agree that the vocally legitimate national trainers and national teamship captains of the member associations often vote after sympathy rather than after an objective assessment.
However, after the captain of Nicaragua had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are further unfairs: Egypt regrets that the votes of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly united voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in upper-case letters and therefore not valid". It has been repeatedly contacted the Egyptian association to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan’s trainer also surprised
Also from Sudan there is a screaming about the choice. While the situation in the case of Egypt is reliable, the Sudanese Association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on the place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was likewise taken with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
He also argued that Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association just voted in his name.
On Friday, the report came from the association: That was not intentional, but, of course, it was not intentional. The filled electoral documents were "wrongly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, but it was provided in a communication from the Association. However, the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the Communication. Rosas and the team trainer Henry Duarte, however, had voted for Messi, "while as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to be examined in an investigation now, but emphasize that the election process was externally supervised by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers advisory company. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winner of World Football Val - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian affairs: Ranghohe Republicans are responsible for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have been open to an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. State of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, the facts that are found are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures are taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the disposal of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the disclosures, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic president and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "seen years".
So far, the Republicans have held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have revealed discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's Party, and the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as against the releasing of environmental protection rules and the reinforcement of immigration rules.
As another ranked Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the convention is now to examine the matter and to go to the ground."
As governor of the US states, Scott and Baker have formally not taken any part in the process against Trump, which is decided at the convention. Therefore, their statements are mainly symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republicans have also made critical comments on the situation. In the middle of Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". The US media also report that there were internal first rices among the Republicans.
The affair could be announced in the initiation of an official resolution procedure against Trump, the democratics in the House of Representatives announced an inquiry. They propose to him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure for official consultation. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the democratics could endeavour a so-called impechment. However, the decision on an actual official resolution took place in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicilia, supposedly rape and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had operated the port of Lampedusa with the Saviorship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board unauthorized. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was resolved after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious assaults against Rackete will be raised. Three men who are tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-watch 3". The suspects have been captured in a recording camp in Messina (Sicilia) after migrants had recognized their penalties in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but have no even secured information," said "Sea Watch" speakers Ruben Newbuilder of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had rape, tormented and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shaking and exposed to horror - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the Communication at that time.
NGOs and auxiliary organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Newbuilder. Torturing is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that they are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that they will follow up."
Italy's former ex-minister Matteo Salvini asked for an immediate excuse from Rackete, which is still established in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks a delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car corporation with the prospect of new record numbers strong boost at the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's round letters. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered up to 95.000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six digits must be obtained in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here are the profit margins. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
U.S. Conflict: Renew only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a ordinary budget. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and decided to finance transitionally until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will be once more without spending plans before the beginning of the new fishing year on 1 October. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) by 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday afternoon, a partial conclusion of the Federal Administration. President Trump must still take the decision into force.
Shutdown disabled
The Federal Administration is now financed provisionally at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the monthly financial year at the end of the month 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time to the 12 expenditure laws allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the budgetary framework of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The democratics have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of democratics who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits are distinguished mainly on the subject of resource allocation for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are evidently trying to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The democratics are disturbing the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the wall construction was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall construction, the spirits divorce
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not once excluded.
In the light of the persistent inability of the Congress to agree timely on the twelve expenditure laws, and the resulting danger of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. Proposal p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of previous years, interrupt the travel activities of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual expenditure plans were submitted.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial fertilization will also be open to alone living women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a legislative proposal of the government, which enables all women to use an in vitro fertilisation, which would mean that the demand for anonymous seed donations would increase significantly.
The presentation requires the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without father" could grow up. The French Bishop Conference is also against the renewal.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethic legislation which defended Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "Chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be carried by social insurance.
Continuous fertilization with sperm by dead husband
With a few majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which allowed widows to have access to the sperm of their dead man for an artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" was allowed. In Germany there were in the past cases in which women in vain complained about the release of the sperm of a dead man. The opponents of the precipitation in Paris argued that a so-born child then suffered a "especially severe fate".
Many Members of the Government Party La République en Marche (the Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and Members of the Opposition, on the other hand, had spoken for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow would be raised a "double grief" if her husband's death was still unfulfilled with her childish wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment believe it is unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with her own partner in the future.
Until now, the artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples that cannot be a child. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the breastfeeding continues to be prohibited.
In Germany, the artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for climate: Call after air fare for Unis becomes higher
There is a lot of flying at the universities, so the country will also be able to carry out a climate tax in the future. The directors say they don't have money for it. But now they also get under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschule
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which has been discussed before the summer break, is again in motion. After the National Rectors Conference has reacted skeptically to a corresponding precipitation from the green-black coalition, the plans are now given support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral attendants of six bath-württembergic universities and a educational university for compensation for service flights. This is the first step "requiringly necessary", at the same time, a wide debate on the avoidability of flights must be held in their opinion. The cabinet decision initially planned in July remains on ice because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia renames North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB Secret Service, the arrested persons were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shooting change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later killed his severe injuries. However, this time there was no injured, it was said.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency, so the North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian waters, where Russia’s coastal guard is driving according to its own information on the protection of their marine biological resources.
30.000 ink fish captured
In the case of the new controls, 30,000 ink fish on the boats were detected and captured. In addition, three fishermen and two motorboats were entangled and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russian fisheries officer had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries Company in the remote eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high ecological damages by the North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these also small creatures were taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future only 18,000: United States lowers asylum upper limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with chosen police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is protective: as the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal accession of refugees is further lowered. Future is to receive mostly threatened believers and Iraq's asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the adoption of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as stated by the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception of protective persons from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, there have been far higher borders.
The ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the United States "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formula which strongly reminds us of the language usage of the official US President.
A "responsibility-conscious association" with refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A great point of dispute is the border to Mexico, which wants to lock up the Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had ceased to the national disaster. Whether there is a timely link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the US capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening procedure of office resolution.
The U.S. Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, as represented by the Foreign Office: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reveals, but are to be included from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador at a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that people from this "Nordic Triangle" of Central America seek asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to reduce migration at the US Southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release from Orang-Utan from zoo
An orange-outan female has been moved to a record station for human monkeys in the United States on demand of the Argentinian Justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was addressed to the rights of a "non-human person", so its release was forced. The animal was brought to Dallas on the Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as Advocate Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human monkeys are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are to live in the open space of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are 21 more orange-outans and 31 schimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entering in Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, United States.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" struck in 2014 has contributed to the conversion of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an Ökoark. By 2023 there is a research and educational site for the conservation of species diversity.
Record for Swiss Extremberg Climbing: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extremberg Climb Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husarenritt on the nearly 3000 meters high cinnamon in the Italian Alps.
Without a network, double soil or other aid, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinn in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. So he undertook the old best mark for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US portfolio manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profit gap. The net profit increased to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (ca. 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous years, as the group informed on Tuesday. This is, in particular, the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" which the Adidas competitor directly contacts its customers online.
In the three-month period until the end of August, the sales rates of Nike increased to $10,7 billion. The most powerful amounts of sales in China increased by a plus of 22 per cent. In this way, the Group of Beaverton in the U.S. State of Oregon also in the People's Republic benefited from its approach to direct direct direct to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Manager Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to advance the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. The investors were happy to respond to the quarterly figures - the sports article manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban because of racism in Italy
Due to racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the association of the Italian capital has committed a lifelong ban against a fan. The defendant Jesus from Brazil had been humiliated by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays with AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted late Thursday. He reported the account of the fan at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters may never again visit a game of the association, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racialism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scanns Italian fans racist vaccinations against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify and throw the responsible ones out of the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. On the occasion of the statement, racist songs were at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
However, there were last discussions about the adherents of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now proved 38 arbitrary fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to leave the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan Groups in the surroundings of Juventus. The twelve are thrown in place, including severe extortion, money laundry and private violence. The club had brought the investigations into roll with an advertising last year.
The Ultra leaders are supposed to have posted Italian media reports behind the black-commerce with tickets. They had the ticket trade for the fan basket "military control" and should have pressed Juventus employees to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcisstic, the generation Z is politics - whole years' courses are designed with agriculture. If you look more accurately, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The Krabbles Come!" This call officially started the crab catch at the Gucheng lake in Gaochun on 21 September, with which the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was announced, as was announced by the Division for Public Work of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environment zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China, and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has environmentally ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have already started crawling. In the course of the past, the crab industry has developed into an eminent industry that has ensured high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively developed a large, ecological and scientific development of crab growing and a technological crab cultivation. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform on the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully built the service network for "approvals under a roof, a team for criminal persecution, a network of services, a platform for credit awarding" and thus aims to optimise the environment of authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun fully utilizes the local benefits by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as dependent signs to establish intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, from culture and health sectors as well as farms leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and foreign transport of national importance. This involves environmental and cultural resources in Gaochun, the state of the buildings for civil services and public services.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the United Nations Full Assembly, spoke of an asserted offer of the United States to abolish sanctions. The United States would have put an end to all sanctions in the prospect for discussions with the Teheran leadership, explained Ruhani on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian colleague about Twitter: "The Iran wants me to repeal the sanctions imposed against him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had been obliged to make a meeting. "And America says I raise the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of penalties that should be concluded have been debated. "And they have clearly said that we raise all sanctions."
However, Ruhani criticized this incidence not in an acceptable manner. In view of the existing penalties and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, as Markel at the border of the United Nations Full Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 rebels
After the western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people have been hurt at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake in the morning, nearly 200 afterquakes have occurred, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, and hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropol. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in future, announced Octay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built housing houses fall into - among others made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City plans like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as refugee places have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bay in August, Istanbul's building engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake safe.
The epicenter of the earthquake from Thursday was located in the Marmara Lake in front of the Silivri district and in about seven kilometres deep, as reported by the Catastrofe Protection Authority Afad. A smaller aftercrew caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbulian mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported at first. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students wept, as they saw on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly jeopardized by earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is constantly shocked by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that a earthquake could threaten 7,1 to 7,4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday came back to the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags with all the necessary finished standing next to doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth waves. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. The Istanbulian mayor Exrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbulian Disaster Coordination Centre (Acom). According to its information, two minarettes of Mosheen crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning before afterbeving in Istanbul
In the social networks many users report of panic. Buildings wailed. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been harder than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter of rebel. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the earthquake is specified according to official information at 13.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a post-crew specified with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was not until Tuesday that a earthquake of strength had shaken the Turkish marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Lake west of the million metropol, the disaster protection authority told Afad on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that it could come to a disastrous earthquake in Istanbul earlier or later - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researchers Sükkrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It would have become more likely, he said to CNN Turkk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Ear or later the great earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also, at the Soil Sea this year had given the earth.
Parliament: New inflammatory in the Ukraine affair
Two brisant documents provide new lighting in the Ukrainian affair for the possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible formulation process, the US Democrats are strengthened: the complaint submitted by an anonymous reference provider on Trump and its controversial phone with the Ukrainian President is a source of important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump itself sees itself more than the victim of a "hox hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - Redirected flights
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The WC door was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, according to US media.
In the event of an extraordinary interlanding on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could eventually be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour if she had been locked in it, U.S. media were called on to other passengers. For a further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554, several people are trying to liberate the woman. "We are working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, OK?" says a man therein. The airline has apologized for all passengers. First, it was open if the woman gets a refund.
The cake lake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about - and his protagonist is unrecognized.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The Conversion" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich) informed. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now at once the mightyst man of Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will in practice and is willingly determined to be stopped by nothing and nobody.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment when ministers lie as the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions seek the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must ask what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." By McEwan, the novel "machines like me" was only published in the spring of the Roman "Maschines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 first published story is Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees "to an unhappy unhappy unhappy person" and is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan declines before Kafka to describe a world, the head stands," said the Diogenes Publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
1,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluster brakes to reduce the noise load by freight trains. Also, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna New Town and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is intended to make it more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the information provided by the EU-related travellers.The funds come from the EU infrastructure caption "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 Oct.
A day after his insolvency contract, the German travel organiser Thomas Cook has cancelled all the trips until October 31, 2019. Travels could not be made "for insolvency reasons," the company informed on Thursday evening.
These are also affected by bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, who have already been paid or fully paid. As it is about travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In conformity with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure is examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the sock of the British Mother Group and had submitted an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, is employing some 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels immediately again money
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels in abroad, which are currently staying Thomas-Cook holidays, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidays are no longer invited to pay extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday places are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as an Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not invited or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel accounts from now on," said speaker Bernd Engelien.
Insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodations on their own, and some had to put more than EUR 1000 on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be aligned on Friday, the insurance speaker said. According to the Thursday, there were still 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidays from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and to find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through Zurich Insurance only helps the travellers who are still on the way. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly only on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In conformity with the insolvency insurance, the further approach is examined, it said. In principle, the insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has been stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys the bomb mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on the traces of his mother.
With a blue splitter protection west clothed the British Prince Harry in Angola burned and destroyed a bomb mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he made the lighting circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive bodies in the Savannah landscape exploded without damage. Although only the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive champion who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to put back the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a clean mining field in 1997 had gone around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African Tourist Metropol Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there will be no guarantee of a third postponement of Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made at the polarizing British forever. The recent judgment of the Grand Court in Great Britain is suspended as a damocles sword over the blonde. His suspension of the Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course to the date of departure was suspended at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliged Johnson to ensure that, in the event of failure to negotiations with the EU until 31 October, the bilateral discussions could be extended. However, Johnson had repeatedly excluded.
Boris Johnson still thinks that deal is possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass to Johnson. In the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he stated that he supports a extension of the negotiations by the end of October in the case of a non-consensus:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm carefully optimistic that this will work.
And the time runs the Brexit traders in Brussels gradually. About six weeks, the EU and the British traders have time to prevent a departure from the UK without agreements, but the recent discussions have not yet achieved any breakthrough. A agreement by the end of October is currently rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not have the law, a new departure of the date of departure is in force, but the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that, in the event of a no-deal, Johnson could implement the Brexit.
US respondents: Other deaths caused by E-Cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of E cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In the meantime there are 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there have already been more than 900 subjects, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been known. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times Mohammed Ali's videos were shared in online networks. The construction operators and actors living in Spain call for a "volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military whose critics propose corruption and maladministration. Ali hopes that a million of participants in central locations of the country will have mass research.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairos, there has already been an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir spot were locked. In recent days, the police have strengthened their street controls and partly searched the phones of footgängers for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir spot.
Last weekend, there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Similarly, the security forces responded hardly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization, nearly 2,000 people were arrested last week. Many of them had been randomly arrested - just because they were "in the wrong time on the wrong place", HRW informed arresters under appeal on lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censur in the North African country. So the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services in order to interrupt further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013 after he had crashed the democraticly elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partly condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was greeted at his arrival in Hamburg Harbour, among other things, by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing hunt "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has examined and documented the consequences of earth heating in recent months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Islands and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has for years waited for the young generation to report by word. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Yet many have acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the heating and the pollution of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured with a drone of Greenland glass and fished with networks for microplastics, said it.
For his "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the seas" the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg climate week. "For all of us who are at the heart of survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prize award. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nudles 430 euros
430 euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 euros was included by the two women, but they posted the disclaimer on Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the prestige of Rome. We call on the police to check whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker of Federagit, the association of the travellers in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Soon the reaction of the owners of the restaurant came. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not taken from the invoice. Also a drinking money of up to 20 percent of the invoice was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official consultation procedure after the turbulent disclosures of the past days, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the representative house now as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposedly standing at the public. The contemplation of Whistleblower, who has brought the conversation for the national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monströs: The President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has exploited the Ukrainian dependency in this respect and will force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be pursued in the now published note of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full text. However, the telephone date of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story in which the center next to Trump stands mainly its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public view in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet himself in Kiev with the President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are vulnerable. "We do not interfere in a choice, we intervene in an investigation to what we have the right to," he says the newspaper. One can think it is unreasonable, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because these information will be very, very helpful for my clients and be able to express themselves as helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasys fixed on Trump's counter-kandidate at the election in 2016: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics at that time said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the United States. However, this claim was never serious.
This is precisely the investigations that will be so prominent about the Trump on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and currently outstanding candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have pushed as Ukrainian representative of the Obama Government to release the then Ukrainian General Prosecutor Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was acting. Biden senior has depressed Ukraine financially to protect the corrupted powers of his family.
In fact, the expiry was something different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian General State Attorney should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected of it. Shockin was also even very corrupt gestures, the US government was far from the only Western partner who pushed to his release. In addition, the Obama government even expressly supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances in Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, especially Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disorders.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again since about 15.30 p.m. The error message also indicates that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems affected by the disturbance, although not in the same range.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive disturbance in this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also take back this time mainly on Twitter to air their trouble.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Polish air weapon from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue hub screw to save.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 p.m. we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat."
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone DO NOT load wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since the last time several new smartphones came to the market, supporting wireless charges and selling themselves very well - all in advance of the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to call again a study from early July to remember. Though cableless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not strictly recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless loading of smartphones. According to the knowledge of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, the significantly larger heating development is always measured over 30 degrees. If you load a cell phone normally by cable, the battery rises to 27 degrees within three hours. In the wireless charge, the researchers have even measured the smartphone in perfect orientation on the charging path. If the mobile phone is something next to the toil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging path increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and life
According to researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of batteries is a decisive factor. Each degree plays a role. When charged with higher temperatures, the battery is not only reimbursed by capacity, but does not last as long as long. So the lifetime is less. Therefore, the researchers recommend to always load the smartphone via cable. Since a battery exchange is always linked to high costs at modern smartphones, this is probably a helpful tip. Apple has last increased the cost of a battery exchange even again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is very convenient:Please put the device on a suitable charging pad - they are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a disturbing cable salad and hard steaker fume. Since with Qi (for inductive energy transfer) a global standard, which is exceptionally also involves Apple, there are little limitations. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has risen within just six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, his expedition organiser informed.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has once made international headers: It comes from a virus photo of mountain climbs that are on Mount Everest Snake in the spring.
The image of the mass resort resulted in a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbs had died at the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climbing of the 14th-thousand-thousand: currently Chinese authorities are locking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals there is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protective area close to the famous and visited by many tourists previous rock fortification Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old by the police speaker. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. Often, they are farmers whose land had previously been harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This is usually happening when the animals move close to their habitat villages.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretically due to their killing.
UK oil tanks leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its settlement by Iran. This was announced by the Marine Agency Bandar Abbas, according to the Irna News Agency. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanks running under the British flag on 19 July under the prejudice to have neglected the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Underhouse is seeking to examine the pledge of the traveler Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner, as well as the question of why the British government would not allow financially to join the company fighting to survive. "Our interest is in the company as well as control by external auditors," the Committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London announced, "We have to do so with a bad example of management."
Experts say that genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the familiar increased risk of intestinal cancer has been apparently overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have concluded in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to weigh more than so far. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of darm cancer, highlights the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk makes Tesla share rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continues in Musks round letters.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer rapidly, and Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered about 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six digits will have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the tree's last losses.
Will the British Government handle Brexit law? Johnson restraining
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers whether he seeks to surrender the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and on a question he said on Friday only to journalists that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a change in the date of departure, no agreement should have been reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political slanders" to avoid the law. Johnson could use a procedural step to move the entry into force of the law to the time following the EU's withdrawal.
Johnson said he seeks a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran is evidently driving high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European Contracting Party in the issue of the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "The European States show incapacity or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the front of the United Nations Full Assembly in New York. If they do not comply with their promises, he put "more steps" away from the agreements of the hardly negotiated agreement of 2015 in view.
The background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained the commitment to Teheran to normalise economic relations. The United States went out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change the course in the nahost policy considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder obligations and now re-resolve hard sanctions against Teheran. Iran last reacted with a recess of the uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared to use the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal, so the Iranians, with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions alone, have left the presumed Rohani, but there will be further discussions that hopefully need a solution.
Rohani continues to fight Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed on Monday the U.S. assumption that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had announced their position on the attack, but the United States considered to be a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must present evidence for this," said Rohani. However, this would not have been known by the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only have called on the rebels in Yemen to do an attack like this. Rohani had hit themselves in recent days with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible discussions with U.S. President Trump, the widespread sanctions of the U.S. administration were first to be suspended, Rohani demanded that the government in Washington sweep to a policy of dialogue and reason.
Komet of other star crossed sun system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This did not happen before. The comet allows conclusions to other solar systems.
What was at first only a suspicion is now confirmed: an interstellary guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of the space was baptized on 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The largest comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory at the Krim - with a self-builded telescope of 65 cm in diameter. Follow-ups from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellar object that was seen on a pass through our solar system.
2I/Borisov provides astronomers with the rare opportunity to get out of the proximity views into a foreign solar system before he disappears at nommers. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
The Komet is analyzed on a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) noted. It is also responsible for the designation and category of heavenly bodies. For the honor of its discoverer, the interstellar swab stars, first led under Catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name pointed out that it was the second interstellary object that was discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in approach. Thus, researchers will remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "Thereafter it will be observed only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into sight. Thus a team around Karen Meech from Hawaii University, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometres in a first investigation. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers and researchers at the Canary Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum from the interstellary swabster, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comits of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves by similar processes as in our, supplemented León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of equally two interstellary visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such step visitors are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors may capture a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-party "Comet Interceptor" (German Comet Interceptor) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to lie either on an unaffected, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellary visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
At the moment before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new Mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and it will be 72 million in 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called "Seestern" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start- and landing trains that will be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new subway transportes passengers in just 20 minutes to the centre of Beijing.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany since 2006 - and significantly smaller - has been frequently shifted. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has landed after four years.
New overhead plane is intended to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British Space Agency is dreaming UK Space Agency. It is possible to make this flight, which was planned in the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company developed reaction engines from Oxfordshire, cited the Agency. "This is the technology that could definitely work," said Officer Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We are talking about the 2030s for the operation, and the work has been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole is currently about 20 hours. As the only airplane for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to the setting up of 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 insets were killed. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin Plane had announced that it was known to develop an overhead aircraft, together with the US Space Authority of Nassau, the "X-Plane". Also, Virgin Galactic had such developments in the programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes reaction engines on its homepage. Sabre drive could be used for efficient travels with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Also, such planes can be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "Next generation of truly reusable railing devices".
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous tips providers in Ukraine's affair
In the Ukrainian affair of potential power abuse by the US President, Donald Trump wants to detect possible undesirable places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the United Nations Messenger in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and they had been "a little different" in the past than today.
This was evaluated as an intimidation attempt against the tip provider. The event was not actually public. However, several US media distributed audio media from the talk on Friday. Democrats reacted resentfully to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official consultation procedure against Trump. Their allegations were based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee who raised serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On large public pressure, the reporter's records had been published on Thursday.
In the context of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, which the US President uses "the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes with the United States' elections in 2020.
In the centre of the charges, a controversial telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his official colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about previous transactions by Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and the claimed efforts to protect his spouse from the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House of the provision, with a view to the Ukrainian telephone: leaders of the government would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual a electronic wording protocol was made, but this was removed from a generally intended database from the White House after the conversation of lawyers and was stored in a specially protected system.
The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote among other things that the "soundant Whistleblower" has distributed information from a second hand that would have appeared inappropriate. Therefore there may be no tips or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have been involved with Whistleblower information, however, caused annoyment. The president of the U.S. Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted anxiously and complained, Trump's statement undermined the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various committees have been conducting various studies against Trump and its environment for months. In view of the Ukrainian arguments, the democratics are now carrying out investigations with new waists in order to initiate a possible process of official collection against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the Representative House, Adam Ship. Trump attacked ship sharply, cast him a wrong presentation of things and again asked for the retirement of the Committee Chairman. Trump was frequently disgusting ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy area, who were mostly active under democratic, but also among republic presidents, stood in a declaration published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible procedure for official collection. If the arguments were true, it would be a "scrollless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
For the further procedure, there is no exact timetable. With their majority in the representative house, the democratics could endeavour a so-called impechment procedure. However, the decision on an actual official resolution took place in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. No President of the United States has yet been dismissed by an impechment procedure of the Office.
VW Operating Council: Jobs are "smoking" cut off
The plans of the brand VW to further reduce the cost of production could go on to the burden of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is about the carbuilder's operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, of which 500 million euros will be saved this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The future pact, which was negotiated between business and business council in 2016, already provides for the decline of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be declined by the carbuilder if it is proved that the related activities are no longer necessary.
However, as our newspaper learned from business council circles, jobs in production that are not actually to be disposed of will be 'sleeved' over another way - that is, by the official course, and thus freely growing regular jobs would often not be re-established.
In these cases, the Board of Operators has no possibility to force the reoccupation. At present, there is a lack of personnel at many places, which increases the workforce, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicles would be greater. This also increases the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A adaptation of the employment volume is made as agreed socially to be along the demographic curve."
The brand VW wants to increase production standards worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind that the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Just in unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make ourselves critical."
In this way there are already successes: For example, in this year the production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8 was to be introduced in Wolfsburg on 24 October, with 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production duration does not call VW, according to our newspaper it is around at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg tribe is the only VW factory in which vehicles are manufactured. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter are made components. For Wolfsburg-Internal, VW-Internal the rules apply that there must be built 800,000 cars annually in order to make the work satisfactory profitable. However, in 2018, the exhaustation in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - as a result of the falling Diesel survey and the problems in converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust test procedure.
However, as the production board of Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, one million cars are "perspective" to roll off the band. This is intended to enable the bonding of golf production in the straitwork - because the work Zwickau by rearranging to the location of the e-auto-producing will give the golf performance.
In Wolfsburg the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also produced. However, the sales numbers of golf and tiguan have last declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8th, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, it is intended to remain the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car first.
Forcing Voodoo to prostitution: Human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been caught with swears, slaughtered into the rural area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human merchants have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human merchants from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday for exemption and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The prosecuted women from Nigeria had been pushed into the rural area and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the traveling Nigerians had to make a ritual owe in their homeland before a Voodoo Priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan lockers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed on different boardelles to finish the claimed locking costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wage was therefore completely reduced.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on boardelle in the process. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the judgment pronouncement. "Some were properly rejected."
The judgments are based on commercial and band-oriented inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, conservation and heavy force prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Durable Conflict with the Lufthansa Group has threatened Ufo with strikes again.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade unions "will inform on 14 October about the labour fighting measures in the LH Group", Ufo Tarif Director Daniel Flor informed on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo for months, as well as whether the trade unions have legally announced tariff contracts in the Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Working Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the tariff contracts were not announced. The Court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined the decision to make a case. "The second court considers the matter completely different," said the Ufo Board of Auditors, "I think it is unlikely."
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the National Labour Court of Frankfurt in order to judge the status of the UFO as a trade unions. The company argues that the trade unions have not set up a representative board for months and is thus not able to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, a violent leadership in the Spartenunion, in which numerous members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board have retired, including the long-term union head of Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended an early vote on the bargain of the cabin staff at the end of July because of its doubts about their leadership.
Enlightened entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnitude, but this is supposed to change now. The country of the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.
With a new visa system Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and home visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to tourists. Visuals are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with families in the desert State survival. With the new rules, the Erzconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. After its own view, Riad wants to reduce its dependency on oil trade.
In the middle of September, several missiles and drones had met two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik and the oil field Churais. In the follower, the national oil production drastically broke, the oil prices shots to the height. It is expected to take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber sit in preparations for wedding
Songer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding. The model posted on Thursday (place time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she was seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People Magazine, had organized a boyfriend divorce in Los Angeles.

Since Thursday evening, the authorities had been looking for the machine after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In searching was also a military hub screw in use. The cause of accident has to be detected. The crash is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European trees are threatened by extinction
Besides pestilencies, diseases, foreign species, non-sustainable wooden beating and the growth of cities are causes of threat, reported the World Natural Protection Union IUCN on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all the 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them are not in any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 hours already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides threatened species into six categories: "potentially threatened" about "threatested", "threat from extinction" and "extinct in nature" and "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than endangered.
Eberic and wild roscastania threatened
In Germany, Eberische (Sorbus) was mainly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by converting or weakening their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild roscastania. They have been considered "threatested" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is to the Balkan mining moths, which has spread from southeastern Europe since the 1980s and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roscastanians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taking into account the evaluation are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Snake and moose are also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for soft animals, bushes and moose. More than a fifth of the soft animals and moose and almost half of all snakes were threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly the destruction of the wilderness, the slaughtered species, agricultural practices and the climate change. Weight animals like snows played a key role in recycling of nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make protection of these species priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. There were no dead, according to the information. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake in the morning, there have been nearly 200 squads. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropol.
Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in future, announced Octay. In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is regarded as specially dangerous to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasic and the Anatolic Earth Plate.
One of the worst earthquakes was one of the 7.6 starches in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. Over 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of strength had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay remotely damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football Final Super Bowl. This was known to the singers at Twitter. "The bigger will not be," wrote Shakira to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was incrediblely excited to stand on the Super-Bowl scenes. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she dreamed of coming up at the Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the semi-time show. "Now it's more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "kings" stand together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the climax of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most seen TV transmissions of the United States. Even if you're last dropped, the spectacle in the United States attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Yet, almost a hundred million people were still cut.
At the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, there had been upset in front: In the struggle about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick did not want to occur, according to top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B in February last year. Finally, the pop group of Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critics were little friendly.
Kaperenick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was in the game time 2016/17 before NFL games at the national hymne of protest against police violence and racism on the knees. With his protest, Kapernick resolved a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This was a great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked mostly African football stars. Capeternick himself has been unconsistent since March 2017 and has no more controversial NFL party. He advocated the associations to disobey him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels receive money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive according to a press report by Thomas Cook. It threatens high depreciations on outstanding loans and loans. It also affects the credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their release of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to make total depreciations on their books of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (approximately 2 billion euros), according to the report. This would have shown estimates from AlixPartner's consulting company.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual depreciation amounts would be more likely to be located at the upper end of the bandwidths, said an expert to the sheet.
The reality of the losses of the creditors at the end will show itself after the insolvency process has ended. A person near this procedure did not give too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad layers. Most money is probably to get out by selling the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it said.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this but have no even secured information on it," said the speaker of the Refugee Organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are pretended to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected criminals were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and hit a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects were supposed to have arrived there.
United States warns federal government from Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai the "trading sheet" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges each company "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC CEO continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidence declaration" from suppliers.
First of all, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "trading sheet" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
The software is very important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change in time," said Pai.
It's "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "whatever would be able to check every individual update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC Chef continues.
The Chinese group Huawei has close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The property relationships are opaque. The employee company that claims to belong to the company is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "trade sheet".
The United States has found out that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for discussions in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, inhabitants hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky over a north-France chemistry factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the north-France city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's craps remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not open carefully on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of Interior had invited the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not expose themselves to smoking. Injured farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and first to adjust the harvest.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk of spreading smell after the deletion, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, there were 240 firemen and 90 police and gendarms in use.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the company Lubrizol, the additive for oils. The production system is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
The factory in Normandie belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which is specially monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemistry accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandie, Pierre-André Durand, said to the news transmitter BFMTV that if first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby His could not be excluded. In the river dust was built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported. At first, the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolitan and is located between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, called on Germany to increase investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest, and the sooner the better it is," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
The Member States who have budgetary spaces for more investment should act, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these playspaces, added the minister and pointed to the high government debt in his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilised" and "senked", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to carry out more public investments in order to survive the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly invited France to retain its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax eases of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The debt is to decrease to 2.2 percent, expected to be 3.1 per cent this year.
Does he still try to tricks?: Johnson excludes question about Brexit-Tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Chaptership Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos breach, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a sludge hole.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to carry out an unregulated Brexit, despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this.
The law provides that the government should apply for a change in the date of departure, no agreement should have been reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister, John Major, expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political slanders" in order to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural step to move the entry into force of the law to the time following the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said that he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement".
Johnson's director Dominic Cummings explained that he feels the political controversy around the Brexit as a "Spaziergang in the park" and proved confident that the desired EU exit is still going: "We will enjoy the, we will win, we will (not.: Red.) come out of the EU, no concern," said the British newspaper "Telegraph".
Cummings, who was leading the "Vote Leave" campaign during the election campaign before the EU referendum 2016, now acts as a headstratege at the UK Government's Downing Street. It is intended to put behind the compromiseless policy that led the Prime Minister into a very unreasonable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it must not always be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (tasks) deeply pops into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her in 1998 from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the video "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a refuge in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
These are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preword. And of course, one is always the focus: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phoned in the bathing mantel with a bag on his head or wearing unformed moonboats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the light of the candle on their farm in South England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept in a bed that her father had built out of old potatoes. And it has not always been cleaned at the McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than pure shots.
It's about the decision click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to knock it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun Essay.
There is the light, the composition, the image section and the colors that make "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but, in addition to all, Anekdotics is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have already worked like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly imposed Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions against Iran, Turkey will continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the United Nations Full Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing iran oil, since some companies "have withdrawn because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular in this and in many other matters," said the Turkish president who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its expiry from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly following a nuclear programme and does not adhere to the Agreement.
Their penalties have led to the break-in of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. Government wants to drastically limit the entry of refugees. On Thursday, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, corresponding to a circumcision of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the United States would continue to be obliged to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens, and the US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. Government will focus on the adoption of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry reveals, but are to be taken up from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador at a maximum of 1500 refugees.
With the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected around the world and relocated in the United States. The upper limit of 18.000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current maximum of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, left, the number was nearly 85.000.
Auxiliary organisations responded to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. Thus, the United States would continue to harm their leadership role in protecting the most injurious people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legally and illegally -. The US Government expects its own details for the coming financial year 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a peak"
U.S. President Donald Trump has acknowledged announcer in the whistleblower affair of the spionage. Anyone who disappears to the informant who has abused power to him, "come close to a tip," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several US media in agreement.
So, when he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial activities in the White House, he answered: "This is coming close to a tip." Then he added: "You know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we were doing something different than we do now."
Observers valued the latter comment on a possible application to the death penalty. The democratics exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and cast him intimidation of witnesses. It was also a attempt to obstacle a Congress investigation to a possible official procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower proposes to the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office in order to ask for a mixture of another country in the US election 2020. Concrete concerns, among other things, his controversial telephone with his Ukrainian official colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump called him close to initiating investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump concerns any misconduct.
However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analytic of the CIA foreign secret service.
Refugee boat retained: Drink babys and babies in Egypt
Once again, people try to get across the Egean Sea from Turkey to Greece, and often the boats often know too much. Seven migrants have now died, including five children, when a snakeboat fell down.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the destruction of a hose boat. Among the death victims there were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek coastal guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which the migrants come are not known. Today, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of Egesia, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee aid work (UNHCR) 174 people were killed.
The Who Breaks the Concert
A US concert by the Rockband The Who has found a yearly end because of an insensitivity by Leadsänger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend apologized and supplemented that Daltrey couldn't really talk at this time. The audience promised Townsend to come at a refund concert at its expense. A date is not yet established.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who said off. They are to be picked up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets shake
WeWork has risen to the largest office rental in New York.
In few years WeWork will rise from the small startup to driving power on the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis. Renters must fear billions of income.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company had discontinued founder Adam Neumann as boss, deferred the planned exchange course and started with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the leaders, to win financial play space for the next weeks and months. In addition, the British Financial Times, WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest hire of office areas has suddenly been reported from the market.
WeWork hires large office areas on the long term and rents them to members in partially small units. This can be individual free professionals, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork is currently burning money in stunning speed with this business. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion, at a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs are supposed to have increased to estimate new large areas to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and hire new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded leasing contracts with durations of up to 15 years, resulting in obligations of over 40 billion dollars. These huge commitments could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for all real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the Economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the last 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office area. Only WeWorks New Contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly arrived market in this time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office lecture in the U.S. metropole would have increased in this time, as Alpert in the "Business Insiders" wrote. Similarly, it looks in London, where WeWork operates several dozen office locations in the best position.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be evident without further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house in the centre of the financial metropol that was purchased last year by the Sparkasse-Fonds provider for nearly 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their real estates for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the owners of the property must probably describe a part of the expected billion income. Access to the - button - reserves of WeWork do not have them despite the long-term hire contracts. For the rental of the individual sites of WeWork is usually carried out by each extra-found subsidiary, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in close boundaries.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days there have been a total of 262 other wildfighters caught illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic secret service informed the FSB of the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured ones, it said. The Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food deficiency.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastal guard is driven according to their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources. In the reviews, 30,000 ink fish were detected. Furthermore, the information was taken after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought after Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the Agency, the Coastal Guard was found in 2018 more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries Company in the remote eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, has recently complained about high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic networks that were banned in Russia. They also brought small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with hygiene and technical regulations.
In the previous week arrests Moscow said that three members of the Russian coastal guard were injured. A also wounded North Korean also later died by the FSB on his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after the fire opened.
United States prohibits entry against Ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed bans on entry to the former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs found this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "great human rights violations". As the Head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he advocated a system in which thousands of Cubans would be randomly arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the forces, the brother of the dead Revolution leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crisiss in Cuba and Venezuela," twittered American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had proclaimed bans on entry among others against members of the Venicezolian government and the military. In Venezuela, for months a bitter force fight between the government and the opposition has been suspended. The United States have committed a number of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and the self-eminated Interim President Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allied Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for services sent to physicians. According to the U.S. and Venice’s opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government oppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go to the road for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for Future plans again actions and advertisements in thousands of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to take place in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large research in Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather together.
How great the global support will be for this Friday after the record participation of the previous week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "Last Friday over four million people have been busy for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the framework of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she supplemented.
Especially in Germany, the entry was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators – about 1.4 million – had participated in the protests, according to estimates from Fridays for future in 575 German cities. This time, a list of movements is planned in at least 65 cities, including metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities as youths in North Rhine-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for climate.
When Thunberg was then 15 years old, in August 2018, had set himself before the Swedish Parliament to encourage the politicians in their country to make more use of climate protection. This has arisen within a short period of time the Friday-for-future movement. Participating in the climate protests are mainly students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global heating must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived in New York nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic tower with a high-sea rainy hunt, where she had last participated in the United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she held an emotional talk at the UN, in which she spoke deeply in conscience to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she had been addressed on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection the alternative Nobel Prize of Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, the people in Russia are not allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, the Agency Tass. The prohibition is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore expect a penalty of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should uncover a fire, then the penalty will be higher. The Ministry is prohibited as to the same burning candles. Also meat sprays on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Battle against cybercriminals - Detectives raise servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German detectives for the first time exposed a large server provider for illegal businesses in the Darknet.
A total of 13 criminals are suspected to have hosted a number of websites at the Mosel as operators of an accounting centre in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through the internationally active criminals.
This was notified by the General State Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a large action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had destroyed detectives in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016, according to the General State Prosecutorship, was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster was first removed in Germany, it said. A webhoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in the neighbouring abroad. It was a result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the detectives want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on roads for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for future plans again actions and announcements in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Yüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale environment in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests 州 Who are actually Thunberg's Hindermen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So surprising that a 16-year-old girl, calculated to keep this time's power person the mirror from the nose. But what's behind it? Is it helpfulness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man creates a gathering of children and adolescents for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt exacerbated to work for a more just world. At that time, he was able to win a crowd of young people for himself and convinces them to cross the sea to get into the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently traveling to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time" to save the world? Besides, Greta Thunberg has rich PR-Manager on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far enough, thanks to the daughter standing in the ramlight. Also old proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little distressed over the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also a few followers too thick. This is not unfounded, because the action came into the media worldwide very well and there is a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits are now divorcing: Is it morally right to make themselves financially rich in saving the world? Is it even authentic when certain people's circles work together with stock market makers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives of different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can seem to make sense also to question critically from certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is crossing our solar system at the moment.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: a foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Lange the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers at the Krim
The said body was discovered by a amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Krim. He looked at the sky with a self-builded telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspect. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of his type that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to shake from the vicinity insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the Komet is clearly interstellary origin and is currently moving to a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is done, the astronomers can see him closely. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Travel Authority Nassau. "Thereafter it will be seen only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge of Komet 2I/Borisov raises hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our comets - for as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sweat star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves by similar processes as in our LON's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Once again, asteroids are occupied by researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed through the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson disturbed by brother
About Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First of all, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister pours the warrior language of the Prime Minister as "smakless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly resting up - at least verbally. At the questioning hour in the suburb this Wednesday, this was a massive resentment of the opposition, and now more critics have reported to word: thousands of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News, her brother uses words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of a EU exit should be "hanging, long-droped, four-partyed, teaped and feathered". They believe that this is extremely absurd. They do not recognize the version of their brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who was invited to the EU parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she stood on the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned a EU-friendly sub-home delegate who had been murdered by a neonazi in 2016, and whose memories were best honored by the Brexit, had Boris Johnson said in the sub-home. "It's very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'British first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The transgressor apparently came from the right extreme camp, which felt "through this kind of language". For all those who were grieved about them, it was very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he twittered. The best way to honor them is if you were passionate and determined for what you believe - no matter what you're thinking of. But never can you "demonize the other side". He also regretted that a atmosphere was created that the attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had established his office as State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory delegate. "I was broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson justified the step.
Johnson's language also encountered strong criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticized the language that is "not worthy" of this country. In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, was not acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: in the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be delivered the half-time show at the next final of the US Football Liga NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredible and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira informed in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropole at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is puerto-rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl put two women on the stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known as the star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. Her global breakthrough created her first two-language album and single "Whenever, Whereever".
The advertising of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. This year many are also called the choice of a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones provided birds there. The NFL Final usually looks at far over 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany now.
Last year there was political controversy in the front. The argument about the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused from protest against police violence against blacks, had been raised in the play of the national hymn and had been hardly addressed by U.S. President Donald Trump, among others. From solidarity with Cape Benick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl event - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group of Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
A actress and youtuber associate Egypt’s ruler: first Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on the return of blood on the streets of Egypt have spent both abroad last week. One of the two swept back on Friday at the Cairo Airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sii returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 put Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected state leader of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had commended Sisis' action against political Islam and lost no silver on human rights infringements on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had awakened to protest against the presidents. He said: "No reason to worry," Sisi said at the airport in the national television microphones. "The Egyptians are not able to lead into the Irians.
In the misleading - that is what the President of the other man, who currently decides what is happening on the streets, thinks he is trying to get into Egyptian ground. Mohamed Ali remains naturally abroad, where he is withdrawn from the access of security forces that would immediately arrest him. A few weeks ago, the 45-year-old actress was known as a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the tonatic voice that rules the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and teaduves of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets", Ali calls up his countrymen to resurrect himself against Sisi.
He goes to the Head of State directly and in truly rustic language. While the people hungry, the President swallows in luxury and lets himself build beautiful new palaces, it says there. The army leaders on which Sisi is based on his rulership, promotes Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he did 15 years with precisely these men's businesses, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - that at least is the impression of many Egyptians, as the just exploding click numbers show.
After the last week, since Sisis' grip had demonstrated thousands of people against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, lawyers of human rights and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for this Friday to a "million march". That really so many people would wage on the streets, was unlikely. But there came to some smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in the village of China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests who were involved in Al-Sisi corruption and demanded its departure. In these protests, the police also set up tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were not initially able to verify independently. From security circles, the police said that they had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrating Banner last week with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built in the city and on the exit streets. In Kairo several metro stations were closed in the city for "conservation work", most streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa-Platt, on which in 2013 the follower of the devastated Muslim brother Mursi was protected by the army until the army took them to fire and killed up to 800 people, another action should prevent the uncomfortable gathering: Sisis' future party wanted to hold a large research for the presidents.
Mohamed Ali caused these measures to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not meet with police officers." But as a retreator, it was not to understand: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than the provider has purchased, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the provider's speed data. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in case of notice.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are an element of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, says the Consumer Centre Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider has acquired, there are various testing options. Thus, the Messtools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the providers are, however, carried out in accordance with supplier specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the Consumer Centre Bayern on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate time period of 14 days to make the promised performance. This is the best way to make the concerned written by enrollment.
If this does not result after multiple calls, customers can quit and may also demand damage replacement. However, in the case of remaining success, only the way of complaint will help.
First ranked Republicans for investigation
As the first ranked Republican, the governor of Vermont expressed himself for an impechment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it results from here, the facts that are detected are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before actions - an impechment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by disclosures that Trump repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the interventions of the democratic president and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed Biden "seen years".
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have detected discomfort. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as against reducing environmental protection and reinforcement of immigration rules.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: More Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Thus, Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universum. It was completely unclear how it should go on with the movies around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man is given after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" a further third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This reports a number of US media in agreement. Thus the film starts are already to be found in the United States: the film is to be started from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am glad that Spidey's way is continued in the MCU. All of us at the Marvel Studios are very happy that we can continue working on it ... He is the only super hero with the ability to play with in various universes, since Sony continues working on his Spidey verses. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has presented an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, including Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of coming SpiderMan videos. However, the message is not confirmed.
Thus Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" Final
The series of "Suits" in the United States has now reached at the big final. In the last sequence, there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, were customized in a charming way. Note that the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duke Meghan did not return for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some looks showed the most memorable scenes with today's heroin. For example, the moments of the failure and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his deceased penalty.
But even her husband, Prince Harry, was repeatedly mentioned in the "Suits" Final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight in the direction of altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a profound comment on his suit. Whether he has actually thrown over a gorgeon, the consumed Harvey wants to know of the bridegroom, just to make a gentle remark: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eye: Baby and four other children Drink in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned in the landing of a refugee boat in Egeica. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastal guard informed on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Today, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of Egesia. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee aid work (UNHCR) 174 people killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that they would visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to "invite Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. Then he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help with the management.
On Friday, a speaker of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofers with EU internal Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, unusually many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does Turkey's deal work yet?
The increase in figures last made doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants illegally crossing Turkey to the Greek Islands.
However, the processing of asylum applications is very difficult to progress on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. At Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5200 migrates are currently in place.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many have been, reported the State Roundfunk.

Especially people with heart circuit diseases, elderly people and diabetes are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pans
The Chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multiway cup in hand on a photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has never been noticed for a long time - and finally noted. The re-useable coffee beker with metal trohhalm has never kept Elizabeth May, the Chef of the Canadian Greens, in hand. On the party's website she was to see on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and was also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a snower (papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chief must be responsible for photo pans
The National Post then prompted May manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible in the subject of environmental protection. And that in the middle of an election campaign for the underhouse choice, Trudeau is increasingly difficult for a bribe scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and attacked the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a contradiction of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their entrance cups."
May appeared shocked and delighted on her blog to have not known anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original to it: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, she put it right, was from Bambus. She always told him. A speaker of the party said it was just about placing the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo it is just a cut to see on the website.
May writes, it makes her suffering for the staff who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to process a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised in Shitstorms because of their use of single-road plastics or flight trips - but their pictures were not shot. Thus, the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at vacation Ice with plastic leafles, as merkur.de* reported.
Influence wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is claimed that Jaqueline Ng was assured by e-mail by Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-declared influencerin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65.000 users. On 30 May, it returned from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the departure, Jaqueline's employees refused an upgrade, although they showed an e-mail in which their Cathay Pacific claimed to have put an upgrade in view. The letter wants to have received the influence of an airline marketing staff. The Airline, however, accuses Jaqueline to have falsified the mail.
On the return, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-term flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport employees were skeptical: they hacked down at the central. And in fact the employee who claimed to be the mail was supposed to have disputed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system where the messages did not appear.
The Airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and suspended a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (approximately 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Cathay had reimbursed the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the costs of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail's metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains locked for future flights. Airline's conditions also indicate that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices shall be imposed in Yemen according to the report on arms resistance.
Oil prices have fallen within the shortest time on Friday afternoon with more than one dollar. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea varieties Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than in the morning. The price for a barrel of the American varieties West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a gun stop in Yemen was a trigger for the course. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have agreed to a gun resistance in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels connected with Iran in the country of Civil War Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A gun stop would expose the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually achieved, you can focus on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the News Agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement over the past days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Last time, Bloomberg had been called on insiders, reporting that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster after the attack in mid-September. Then the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moves back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases called on insiders, reporting of rapid progress from the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative headers.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's settlement and the recent release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship is still in front of anchor, Reedereichef Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced that they would move defense missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archipelago to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had sometimes increased the oil prices in recent weeks.
Prosecutions against Trumps Strengthen
In the affair of possible power abuse by U.S. President Donald Trump has become a loud wording against the White House. Several leaders of the government would have tried to prevent access to the wording of the conversation at the end of July after a controversial call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. This explained an anonymous reference provider. The speaker of the Representative House, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, was explicitly sent to the White House "Gifting". Trump spoke of a "Hex Hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim as questionable
North Korea has made doubts that in the nuclear dispute it will soon come to a third summit of power owner Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and success of such a meeting will be questioned because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Chief Diplomat Kim Kye-Gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the Advisor of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized reinforced US sanctions and the common military maneuver of the United States and South Korea. However, he hopes that a "wise" and "courageous" decision of Trumps will come back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what to bring a third summit with Kim before he declared it. The negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been held in Hanoi since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to resurrect the discussions, but without any major success.
Prins Harry: Arms manufacturers are intended to help mine cleanup
With a blue sharing vest, the British prince Harry in Angola symbolically entranted and destroyed a bomb mine. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he made the fire circuit. In safe distance, the bombing bodies exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola free of mine until 2025, he later asked for the running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who have not helped to remove them, to commit themselves to help."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
Britain pound under pressure
In view of a rapid reduction in interest, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a rapid reduction in the interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pounds of sterling. The UK currency accepted up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales triggers were the statements of the note banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest, even if a chaotic brexit could be reversed, since the insurance would be affected by the British economy at an absurd time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders was valid for a restrictive monetary policy, said analytist Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would also like to lead his country without a divorce agreement on 31 October from the EU.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay for him, says trade sheet editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Showing other Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Lab is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, a single director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletic World Association.
At the beginning of the light athletics WM, new details of the Doping Scandal in Russia appear - and they destroyed the few credibility that Russian sports had recovered at the beginning of the year, and also only in practice. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labour finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antitidsoping Agency (Wada). Now it became clear that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had blocked the Russian antidoping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not entirely banned by the world scene. The International Olympic Committee read after an individual examination at the summer games 2016 in Rio about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. Also at the World Cups in the different sports sports, they were allowed to be there in Russia in summer.
Missing positive findings
In September, the Wada again raised the Rusada band, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples that were said. The data should provide information about the extent of the treatment of doping cases in the state baptism. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Labor was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada was given by a whistleblower and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
WM not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Athletic Association holds as the only organization at the ban of Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes are launched under neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already placed in the space and invited Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-block of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympic Games in 2020 in Tokyo.
