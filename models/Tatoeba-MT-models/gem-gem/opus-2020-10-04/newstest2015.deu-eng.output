The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese official colleague Shinzo Abe in Toko at his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day journey to Japan to establish economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was taken after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport policemen in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had watched it as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on to the Burgess Road before he booked off to the Buschland, where the officials lost it out of their eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the description of the driver was later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Carratha Police accuses a 20-year-old man of non-observation of a stop signal as well as unrespected driving.
He is supposed to appear in Karratha before the Court of Justice on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rapeing a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, sleeping, and no consent could signal."
Webster is also proposed to rape a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim on May 4, 2014 in Scotland.
Judge Lady Rae held the hearing for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recovery to the very American ideal of working rights as human rights
Congress delegates Keith Ellison and John Lewis have made a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and vice-president of Progressive Cucus at the convention.
That is why I proudly present, together with the citizens' rights icons, John Lewis the law of staff authorization.
This pathbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-commerce-oriented forces.
The supplementation of the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade representation, to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damage replacement or penalty - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest is to get back to a very American idea.
Despite the relapses that the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and association law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to approve a Constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the role of the workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "workers' rights are guaranteed for association and joint trade and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In acknowledging the need for workers to organize themselves and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans put in a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed for each individual and every profession or industry.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are zero and invalid; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had the Presidency on the International Commission for Human Rights, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect or join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic prerequisites that labour rights are human rights.
When this country prepared other countries to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade unions - and that this trade unions should then participate in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After these rights have been shot in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so that the working population must have the right to unite and to gain hearing in a free and open society.
As pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.
By increasing the living standard of millions of people, work in a marvelous way has created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unpredictable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do so too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of representatives of workers - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and resolved the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion hospitals in Louisiana could force to shut down
On Sunday, a US federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, saying that it probably led to the conclusion of all the five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is supposed to enter into force on 1 September, would force physicians who perform abortions to make a patient recording right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that the doctors can continue to perform legal abortions provisionally while applying for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to work law-conformly while trying to obtain these rights," stated Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the recent decision in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing a deceptive law that will take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics that had not joined the complaint and also applied for instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states who have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as not constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that medical instruction rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents refrain from the fact that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a physician who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instruction rights, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for his safety, said the group.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their application for patient admission rights would still be adherent.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates caused by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James put a video hommage online for her mother, who died in eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of death during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMES STUDY: New medicines may slow lung and egg cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of eggstock cancer, existing pre-disorders and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer was already further advanced to diagnostic time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was about 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedical services in order to contradict distances, it proposed, as possible, to reinforce the service of fledged doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that, regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in eggstock cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother aged 33, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decreasing numbers of household owners
The decline in the number of household owners under the age of 35 may result in the loss of garden centers of tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Kernal Group for Garden Products".
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their home spend for their garden.
The increase in people living in high urban areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes and the falling garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which estimated £5 billion are sold annually.
In London, where over a period of 6 years the share of household owners fell from 61 to 43 per cent, the minimum expenditure on garden products per household will be reported.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that dwelling for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, CEO of the RHS said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with in a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of the garden retail trading due to increasing household income and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecasted for this year a improved market situation because of the better weather by unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement of imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back from PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up his operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends back.
At the same time, about 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a mile away, they delivered themselves with stocks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's retirement, but he rejected it.
The army of the country admonishes, however, to a political solution to the conflict "without time and without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition policyer Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif has deceived the parliamentary election last May.
The protests were escalated in the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to insist on Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diploma for spying reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the oldest US diplomas in the country to find out a report on American and British spyings in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the business manager of the U.S. message and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analytist of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major field of activity for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also had the most important secret service in Germany, Ankara, made the Turkish government’s reaction much more angry.
Warning strike: Locus guide threatens with consequences for pendlers
The federal warning strike of the Lokführer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The period announced for 18 to 21 p.m. concerns all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-way transport;
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

Said the district chairman of German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is goods transport.
The German railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wants to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Officer of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence for the police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca.
The Chief of Calvià Police on the Mallorca island was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the famous Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online day newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence for the police and employees of Calvià City on Friday to the Office of the Prosecutor for Corruption Control Mallorcas.
Two other local politicians were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the accusations of corruption and were consulted with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the upset nightclubs were proclaiming that the government's counterfeit economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our life basis out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headers this summer due to a viral YouTube video, a 18-year-old British tourist who took 24 men during a cleaning tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the proper behavior of alcoholic holidays in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the famous alcohol-drawn tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio event took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organisator Carnage have to pay together a punishment of 55.000 € (73,000 $).
The tourist place Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidays, is also known for several accidents under alcoholic influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with strong showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening to 21 p.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen down in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a gun that began just before 20 p.m. and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided a early dose spring, temperatures in the city fell back on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The bowling weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m. but was hit by a wind wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and eventually set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C will be predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthias says: Maximum time for large networking
In view of the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our pleasant home into high-tech shell centers, our columnist Bernd Matthias comforts himself with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But behind it there is a thought: if the cable wasn't, all listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be significantly more retro.
In no way applies to the eckeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that the world's newness from today's electro-scrap of tomorrow is bought - obsolete.
And, for example, who still has a pipe television in the living room today, simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these thoughts?
Because the incidence of the Ifa at the Funkturm this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronic questions.
The labyrinth, who formerly controlled washing machines and CD players blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with incredible little expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What do you want to talk to people who seem to spread such quark voluntarily?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been particularly important for us to network our house.
In order the yoghurt to resettle itself, so that the firemelder informs us on the holidays of the Maldives that it is burning in the workroom.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the air conditioning office to our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true next: We lift our bracelet clock, say, "Sucking!" and the dust sower's riding home.
Irre.
Everything goes beyond nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown goods fade," a industry expert finds that you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamgarer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but what is not useful because we are in the steady.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-modical device is really urgently used, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable will also survive the next radio exhibitions on the phone.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israelite children from the areas near the Gaza strip returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection areas, while rocket and furniture shots on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area was recovered from the fights.
The start of the school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by missiles in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fights are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a missile, were removed from the walls and slide walls before the students arrived.
"We have a bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school.
"There were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until the war was suspended last week, thousands of inhabitants of border municipalities, such as seed, stayed in their homes or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and furniture fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Mörsergranate, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily stayed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is severely drawn by the Palestinian shot.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said: "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited weapons stop last Tuesday.
The rest of the arms led to an immediate end of the fights, but important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas for an abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of the Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect conversations is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes these information and estimates that it is at least half of the victims of fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for these information.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,491 missiles and mortar granates during the battles on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into preliminary protective areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protective areas and continue to fight, educational authorities defer the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue learning, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban procedures
In view of the voting losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl spoke for an end of the current NPD ban procedure before the Bundesverfassungsgericht.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current ban against the NPD should end before the Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also a CDU country manager in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to find the result of political fighting against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed hardly at the five-percent herd during the Sunday vote.
In 2003, a first start for a ban on the legal extreme party failed because the constitutional protection had informants at the NPD tip.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tente for new refugees
In New Land Place refugees are now placed in tents.
The Central First Inventory for Refugees in Harburg is placed from all closes.
Now the internal authority has made up three tents of the Red Cross.
District politicians were only briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to reserve the citizens and give the district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party calls for Harburg district management to provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial recording are the incidence of applicants - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a far-reached index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10,9 per cent, more than twice as much as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research manager of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with average prices increased by five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale is Canberra, which was severely affected by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices rose only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued that the spring start would now be a rise in the property for the next few months, which would undergo a "real test" market.
"If you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a general fast sales rate and the constantly low interest environment, it is likely that the own home prices will increase further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the editor Peer Medau and certifies this to pose "as a fieldlord".
This is not the style of the university, says the communication.
Thus the Medau family has already been informed orally in mid-June about the attitude of the university.
The statement that the plans were not known until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminary or even decision-making" but "preferencies".
The expansion of the small road to the castle also is less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was a road of nine meters wide and is not the talk.
It is about 5.50 meters at present, which is a meter wideer than ever," Poetzl explains.
The Medau operator argument that their free and educative parking areas will then only be used by college students will not allow Pötzl to apply.
Train parked is not at all because it is intelligently solved, as with other public parking sites.
Think of the inhabitants
The children's crib of mountains, which is located on the terrain and which would lead the access to the park deck by the door, is supposed to be "not affected", according to the high school president.
Rather, he thinks, "that this is not only about the children's crap, but also about the inhabitants of the Friedrich Strip Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is much more than the particular interests of the Gentlemen Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent's council of the children's crack, with the expansion of the road, would be justified by "the few naturally dependent spots of Coburg", "the readers can decide themselves".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city trees about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new exclusion".
Last week, Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crap about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new park deck is not supposed to lead over the campus and the Friedrich Strip Street, but over the Medau Mountain.
Thus the small road had to be expanded to a mile length of two tracks.
According to the Medaus high accounts, traffic would be tenfold in the park of Hohenfel's Castle.
About 2,000 vehicles are spoken daily.
From the city sides, they have not yet wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf comes back from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt introduced health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was mature for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion informed on his Facebook page.
Thus, he goes to international retirement with a balance of 167 national games and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the champion-league winner from Flensburg wants to go to Tore hunt for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces its box for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me as they will be enthusiastic to my long-term fellow players and my followers.
But for my club, I want to be healthy available in the next few years, for that it is necessary for longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double burden.
The left hand had to fear his career in 2012 after a ferry infection.
He had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Bond (DHB) with a cortison syringe that later caused a strong inflammation.
A emergency operation and two other actions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are not passing to a body spurlessly.
I have some healthy building sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012, I never managed my blood pressure properly.
This includes some other sliced complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I could control my head, but my body couldn't deceive," explained Glandorf in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He'd only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"If all the stripes are riping, I'm always ready to speak," the two-fold family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble as regards my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least somehow straight.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the win of the Champions League in 2014, he received the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he secured with Flensburg the European pocal of the Pokal winner.
German economy in spring decreased by 0.2 per cent
The crisis around the globe has broken the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to late June 2014 compared to the prequartal.
This informed the Statistical Federal Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy alone lived in the spring while the investments fell.
The external trade also broke the economic trend.
Thanks to the strong annual start, a total GDP rate of 0.8 per cent for the first half of the year is a total of 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led the Burgmanns City on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling band of the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
The largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants, with their registration at Jos ter Huerne, thanked for the organisation of this tour through the Münsterland.
Posted in various special journals, this tour was offered interesting.
We're coming from Den Helder and we've been driving overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the bicyclers rejoiced over the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
Following the registration at the Vereinsheim der Schützenbrückerschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
In addition, the route, which was awarded for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz over the Schöpinger Berg towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and imagebeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 height meters, the bicyclers proved their good condition.
They were eaten on the way to Havixbeck and picturebeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization passed without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive feature of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see us again in 2015 on hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers plan a new edition.
Constantine Wackers Honestly Fair Memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantine Wecker, Songmaker, Pacifist, Polite Safe Activist, Ex-Haftman, brought to paper in "Monks and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thought fetishes for thoughts, the monks born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by an appropriate song text.
And he is honest: from onanie as a gymnasiast to shop stealing and drug use he does not expose human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but so more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in Now, Spirituality - all of this he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as did not only the music (the opera lover became a Soul and Rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Lastly, the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker also approached the ascetic monk, which is "deduced by subtraction", as he says, "by letting away everything unnecessary".
But between all the high-hearted views there are also short anecdotes for the earth: for example, about struggles in a place frequently frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, where he sent a tree frontally.
Even there he is unfair.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tests for a comodie, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" treatments after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Hold up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who had already grown up when I was a child, went into the cricket with him and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a casting in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, moisturized, deep stiff labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rush.
Earlier, my father just slept in the basin, and then he was slowly heard how he began to sing because he could wash the jewelry off himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop embracing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitnessing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bark.
Since he was commended by the critics for his Othello, he has been joined by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and combodies who have completed his business life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/Comedian on television for a quite long time."
He was learning in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in the eyes of the public but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minimumrel Show, a simple entertainment program in which people "black pitched," Henry held his Comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly prize-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that were ridiculous and feasted by the British black culture, Henry worked in the eighths on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to the show in 1984, and in the nineties he was among others known as the kitchen coach Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chief!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls were characterized by his next decade, but after his BBC series, LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you're just going to get the time or step a little on the place."
Then a series of documents for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first sequence was Shakespeare.
I was quite allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned about him at school, and I thought he was mainly a domain of middle class, white ones in trumpets and a head of coal in front of it.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry held 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right.
"This is why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break over 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea was going on as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tensions.
This also came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a Dangerd voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbreaks, while he is constantly imitating people.
I decided not to make stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you'll ride in front of a wall.
I sometimes act live in Apollo if I want to do so, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be a actress.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebells block streets in Jemens capital
In conflict between Shiitian Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sada on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenic media reports of a transport chaos in the capital.
According to the online release of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the sheet, with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiitian Huthis fights for more independence from the Sunnitic ruled Yemen and demands the withdrawal of the government.
The people's tribe of Huthi has been besieging the Jemenite capital for nearly two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large roadways of Sada.
In the surrounding country, there are constantly bloody fights with the Jemenite army.
Kenia registers officials to impress "Special Employees"
Kenya has started to register all officials biometrically in order to remove "spiritual staff" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid were a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of persons will still receive salary payments from the public service after their departure.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to combat corruption in public service at his office in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, a study found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 £) per month were lost on payments for "ghost workers" and other misuse financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri to the BBC from Nairobi capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was communicated in a government notice.
All those who did not do this without a credible excuse would be deleted from the salary list, the communication was continued.
"This is a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and by cleaning up the salary list at both levels of government - so the "spiritual staff" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before the court on 11 November.
Five inheritors of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Landgericht and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was told by a lawyer on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach has deceived the purchase of artworks and old-timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also lead to a higher degree of the agreed provision.
Achenbach has purchased value items for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He served in school for 44 years, of which 23 were heads of school.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always worried by his strive to see people in the pupils.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of the giant mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
Already as 14 years old, he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were dismissed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern - in Goodswaggon in 1946.
Thus judges smote into the Upper-Frankish Lowendorf.
The teachership took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers a week to the next train station, travel to Bamberg by railway, three kilometres across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping place in a red-creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years, the second State degree.
Since he had no free teacher's office, he ordered to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he visited a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
By then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen in today's Council House.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a refund in the now smaller school, the then director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to engage in today's building, which was extended after Judges' retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then Mayor Ludwig Götz, who, in addition, had a workroom built on municipal costs and in the enlargement of 1997, solder rooms, although this was not eligible under the school building directives.
"Citizen Champion of Götz was very school-friendly," remembered judges gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had replied to a talk of a school board on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "This doesn't always work." Whether he meant just his pupils or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students struggled, they did not get a punishment work from him and were not dunned to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had created two pairs of box gloves and made the two contradictors turn against each other, even if there should be a feather.
For the benefit of the school, judges as a director held a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the pardelose judge after his retirement to candidate at least in 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the municipality.
However, judges were elected in place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bike drivers place in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Schoten intermediate stops
When cyclists make their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schoten Rast, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of rasting impressions made: The 700 participants of the Mr4-Radtour as well as the accompanying roses enjoyed a break in the lower curriculum of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radles and celebrate on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and there experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists attacked the first stage, the 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the manager of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwifes from Ranstadt and Lower Mock City had backed 85 bleachs of apples, cows, sprays and cheese cooks that made the skillful cyclists wonderfully.
"Some cakes can only back landwifes," a participant from Aulendiebach commended while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking level of the Giß-Nidda tour club, cold refreshments could be arisen.
The "Duo Bravo" held visitors with well-known melodies from opera and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
Moreover, a gentleman enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved her, eventually he has re-fitted riding chains that are already lost today."
However, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the Trinker House of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotion Chief Tobias Hagen, since the first Mr4 tour 2004 as a tour leader, was also able to take a short time, but he had plenty to do with the technology on-site.
His pick-up truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reportages, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhein-Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulla, Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from many cities in Westfalen, cyclists are invaded.
The number of participants is a bit based on the available accommodation capacity.
Participants in Category I are stayed in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodations.
From the curriculum the cyclists had a good impression when they stopped after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the wheelers were required in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the board of the Scotland Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival ambient, and of course, deliciouss, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner Sax in his role as member of the AdAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were obviously delighted in the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance beans.
The opportunity for vigorous movements in the free sky was used eagerly despite the sports activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests, citizens who had been affected by the good mood were increasingly mixed as the great crowd of bicyclers.
On the second day, the cyclist stations Birstein, Wachesbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenwalds - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of bicycles, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they claimed to have founded a organized criminal association and picked up telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian peoplefront, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastückhow, school head of the school in Slaviansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in their future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, the children wear embroidered shirts, keep balloons in hands, and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory sleeve from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bomber, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when the top post of Pearson's mother company went to a younger male colleague.
Their recovery was supposed to be nearly £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the advisor of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inside on the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and disturbance when things go wrong.
This provides a almost insistent duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But the new chairman who arrived would risk entering everything and separating an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overdue.
While the competition moves closer and threatens new technologies with old, convenient security, the ongoing negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is linked to special dangers.
For the modest sum of £14.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pences per day.
And it seems that the BBC rises again on the popularity scale: 53 percent today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get message headers on my cell phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decline in comment on the democratic prosecutor, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official violence.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another user account of Perry, which disputes the previous.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account expired, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the previous Tweet, a disadvantaged picture of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness on the tax.
Perry made a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to retire, which led to an accusation against Perry - which might be a Presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcoholic level ... but if I do, I complain to governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the most drunken democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of judicial assistance applied to the judge responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the principal governor in the history of the State of Texas is unconstitutionally diffus.
Perry stopped $7.5 million government money at the public integrity unit of the state - which is located in Travis County and is identified in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to retire.
This veto provided a public complaint by a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After graduating at the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidate for 2012, Perry admitted to speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself when yogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction operators pointed out that the residential market in the southeast of England was returned to the normal level.
Private homes in the capital were warmly desired and the subject of enormous price increases, which moved the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set the ceiling for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Sins the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to the normal transaction level since the maximum level of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the catastrophe, prices in the urban area alone have risen by 18,5 per cent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales total.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers increased by about one fifth last year and was about £423.000 at the end of April.
However, in the last few months, a stronger pound has reduced the attraction of property property in London for foreign buyers - some of them have also been disturbed by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetorics for a possible "violent tax" from the general elections in the coming May.
The London Real Estate Maker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper loan arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth during the second half of the year, both in the real estate sales as well as in the prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hampties International, another real estate agency, corrected his forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, on the basis of a already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by one quarter by year, according to the Makler WA Ellis.
Yet, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts to which the date is sold are more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the sales of the date also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year by the end of April - almost one third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tariff result increased by 40 per cent to £280 million per year, the turnover by £18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a report on Monday before the company's Annual Assembly, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would probably meet the current market expectations during the current year.
Analyticals estimate the annual pre-tax result at 450 million £.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in the afternoon in the London trade.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence Show at the 85th Oscar hire.
Naked photos of Oscar prizeholder Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.
A representative of the Star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "exact injury to the privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue posting the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were claimed to be obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The claimed "Master List" of Hacking sacrifices includes the names of thousands of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It's not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in our home's private environment years ago - I hope you're really satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" agrees, however, that the photos deal with pictures of her and twoth "These so-called neck pictures of me are GEFÄLSH, people.
Let's fight the beginning. *Word game intended*.
On the late Sunday, Buzzfeed reported that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande defeated the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letters "J".
It was best to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton that you left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, exercising, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And shake his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was tough, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stubbornness was a very startling affair that had been much more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a shaking tender beauty with unhealthy hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and roarier than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompanyer that Kevern thought she was her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the treffend name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leak, in the baths there were still spines, necks had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to all, and the garden was overwritten with weeds, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a child march, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn handy on the broken lie chairs in high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had joined themselves spiritually away in the service console, which provided the country with calm music and comfortable news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, which his father had liked to listen at closed wheel shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so right forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsoleted, like obsoleting the word.
The general taste achieved what the releases and regulations never had done, and how the people in books chose the Balladens from the counter-washer-to-millionary memories, cooking books and love romances in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and singing in a grob-comic serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still a child.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without laying two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It hadn't been very funny at that time, and it wasn't too funny.
He knew this was expected from him, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where they would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musical.
Although he had become ten years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz about the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or boundaries.
A conform society meant that each element of this society thankfully agreed to the principle of group talent - thankful as that saved from fate.
People with afro-Caribian origin were suitable for entertainment and sport by temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by electronic talent like nature and were responsible for the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks destroyed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country as WHAT WAS WAREN, WHAT THE SCHEME WARED---of fear to be accused of fire shoes, even fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pie restaurants, kept in mind and became depressive with inactivity.
Everyone according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that the kevers had just sung to her ever could be extorted.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the giant coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in their presence.
She nevertheless thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head with an unbelievable shaking and locked up his eyesight.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her uncommon raven black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me yet.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet like that.
Maybe your knees, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knees are too thick?
Do you hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"Your thick knees are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm that was needed to counter the greed that was inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon became red and risen out of her chair, threw the console and poured the wine that they had drowned.
Holunderbloom wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to shake, like palm wedding in the storm.
"And your thickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perversely attracted to you," she said ...
Except that I'm not.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same giant and ice-called ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more degrading after DEM WHAT WHAT had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or slaughtered them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she wasn't watching!
They first knush - knuts were the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction between men and women, a counter to the nonspeaking love ball shops from the console - they knock first and then hit them.
Kevern believes that this was an unnecessary refination, since the knutch itself was a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He arose out of the chair like an old man.
She felt also bleeding, but the mourning of his mourning surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You hardly knew me.
She looked at him as he was away - like from a room in the upper floor her companion saw him - a man, complained by something he had made up his own.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men generally, although some had lifted up their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, curved his back, ashamed, defeated, without a battle spirit - why was that a look she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember once she had seen something like that before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
A number of years before the events just spoken, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public atmosphere, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolition, was most expected, in view of the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has been done a lot, and much has still to be done," she wrote, "to reduce the native aggression of a people, which led a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely seen historically despite the highly questioning church towers between the hills.
But some qualities appear as inextinct.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The people weep when listening to sentimental ballads, devotes themselves to stories of overwhelmed difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the existence of a new and depressive dispute in the home, at work, on the streets and even on the play fields.
"You have an unhappy tendency to overdrive," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less romans.
Esme Nuss tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask you, are you an Atheist?
"I don't think I need to say that," answered Esme Nuss tree.
Are you lesbian?
Esme rejected her right to privacy and refused the statement.
Feminist?
Quiet again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a non-profit workplace.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may sometimes distort results, as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call "restraint" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to look at what's happening, if it's happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential viability.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice given by Ofnow to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to balladen, visit Musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," answered Esme Nuss tree with a quiet voice when she was sure that her manager had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been so effectively cured as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that we may, without warning, find out how we repeat the mistakes that are only to DEM WHAT WITH WHAT WITH WHAT WITH WHAT IT IS.
This time, however, it is not the other ones we let out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call actions "failure" that our grandparents may have committed or not.
You also go too far when you speak of these who would have left out their "wrath" and their "misstrains" on "other".
It should not actually be necessary to remind anyone in your position that we speak of "uns" and "other" when we understand the past as when protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there wasn't "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing more to say about this - we agree.
And just as no debt should be awarded, no debt should be abolished if such debt would be appropriate and if there would be a way to wipe it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to forget it.
If I can say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider their report," he said and left them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was taken over by a motorcycle driver, who, as passages described, had driven in a kind of "brutal anger" on the footway.
There is chance.
Lesotho Military Member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a state strike for the government's crash and said that they were taking action against policemen who are proclaimed the army of political fanatists.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting about threats of suicide.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is de facto no state strain, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatists" whose army was ahead by the police.
"What happened this morning, the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he received several secret service reports that some elements within the police acted which actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatists who were just ahead to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of a relapse.
"Even if no one claimed to have crushed the government by violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of the Leotho Military informed on Sunday that the soldiers were slowing back into their cassettes and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane noted that he believed he was become a goal because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane has suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations despite.
Production in the euro area in a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, such as a closely observed study.
The final market shopping manager index of the production industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a period of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place on Thursday before the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a delay in the recovery of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further information during this week if he considers a quantitative ease for the euro area, according to those carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"But a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to prevent the fire of the analytists who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchase manager index of the production industry in the eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow afterward."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are currently obviously finding life quite difficult, since the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine – increase insecurities under the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence – and likely lead to delaying or even cancelling some contracts, especially large contracts.
He said that it will be "more likely" that the ECB should eventually introduce a type of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."
The Decade of Hell of Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible camping of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people of Czech military were taken hostages at a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day torture that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had missed death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible camping of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, warned the heroic survivors last night against a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, and killed, this seemed to be the evilest of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East into abomination, and then surprisingly transformed itself into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst affliction.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the cruel thing in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine now visits - and in the children like they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back to the scraped school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine was exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them in security.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be operated again.
Some granate fragments are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says fighting fluently.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were young, dreaming of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the camping will always be part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the picture of me online when I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help not happen again.
The boy who fled through the bullet hail believes his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school with seven years) and survived the three-day camping in his mother Tamara's arms.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mamma told me I should lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Run."
With fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying baby, grabbed it at the hand, and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Wladimir, who locked his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In reality, Tamara was stabbed out and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cryed for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later fled to London (from now dissolved news of the World) in order to receive the title of a children's children's Champion by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blasting in my memory.
I remember just after that I threw away all my toys guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he fears the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I'm so sorry about all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help you.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school college next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the camping, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence took many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that it's been 10 years, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the damir and me helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and called them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with servants in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are exactly the kind of children like ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for vengeance, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and inflamme candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered below - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and I saw hell around me, with body parts all around me.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I fooled him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the besieging became the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 camping, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloody face was characterized by fear when he ran for his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbarai of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intricately: The image of Georgia (left) was one of the shockingst of the attack and was violated as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school this day and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at our home in the book shelf.
I understand, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It's important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever learned the truth.
People are continuing to investigate such tragedy and never learn the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing about such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares because of the camping, but then it got better.
Later, in 2004, I returned to school and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st of September moves closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends a tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed my school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderer terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was captured at the feet of a murderer terrorist during the camping, but he managed to survive.
During the camping, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb, fixed at the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his health damage due to the composition.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost my consciousness.
I will never return there again and don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the camping on the laptop
My pain is unhearted, and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me for school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never report to my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse if the anniversary comes closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this if something like that happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the camping and that only strengthens my pain.
I've lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart crys for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't believe that.
We were a friendly country before, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are still killed.
If we could only grab and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10 / 1
The baby that has been carried so gripping by a special commission in security
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is put in safety by a Russian special commission (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all
The world kept breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan's camp.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelness, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar retained in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous assassination.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since then and with his new wife, Svetlana, has a little girl he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the camping and has grown into a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up on the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on footgänger transition to Fife
A 78-year-old man stands in court because of the overrun of a three-year-old girl on a walking cross in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the transition to Pitenween in East Neuk.
The charge suggests that Mr Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and hurts the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, defends the accusation before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC launched the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most priceworthy option is a waterproof point-and-shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which is both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras that all are available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery tub and other facilities are closed.
Set your camera also on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimise the exposure time for the dumb underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only authorised for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our buyer and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD that you can compose images with, action cameras normally not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to view this under water, and the correct image setting is a cause of happiness.
So you're doing a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of recordings with lightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a advisor of anaesthesia he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agency of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, a MI6 member who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to the diagnosis and diseases, while the treated are mainly busy with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble racing myself.
While fighting with the influential symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather want everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to take a X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer, which attacks the chest trap, so the pulmonary skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which once was considered to be "wonder substance" but was now recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s than industry has voluntarily undertaken to stop using it.
Even where he was still set up, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - clampers, construction workers, roommen and shipping workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardant from a different time, it seems hardly to be anxious today.
But this self-satisfaction is unpleasant.
Great Britain, so it seems, today experiences the climax of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths caused by mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliomortals since 1980 and expected future deaths in UK
The reason why we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all asbestos types were prohibited), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the hostage of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class limits, financial limits, professions or ages.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not protective.
Parliament buildings are asbestos infected.
Also in the hospitals where we are supposed to get healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the source of this carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and prudents - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my agemates will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will still be sick?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at 48 years of age.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio marks die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still get sick?"
The leading expert in the UK on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when asbestos epidemics in UK are expected to occur, 90,000 of the disease will be victims.
Most of them have no idea that they will die like this at the moment.

A short look at the documents of the courts, to which the subjects are often turning to because of damage replacement requirements, shows how far the mesotheliom's giggle is already widespread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had suspended asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at M&S.
Now she has two children in the teenagers.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I wouldn't have thought that would affect me once.
There are only a few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestim form", a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boiler isolations, even for braking in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO regard it as a "great health risk" with potential death.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear, but indirect evidence that this was a key reason for the unique high mesothelioomrates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy in the Flagship Store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma was probably caused by work or at home by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unawarely exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service dishes and pipelines behind the parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be worn up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members are frequently accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Director of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure health certificate", it is uncontroversial that £1 billion must be put on work over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "asbest’s existence was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've been working on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was just doing a surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I got frozen.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest, the skin around his lungs, was touching.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Amazed doctors took X-rays in his chest and activated pleuracate to remove liquid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sporting and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But also now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his home doctor brought his CT scans and ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, precisely two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a sun equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the reef and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "There was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan sickness sisters, from whom one recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It appeared that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were underground, so patients were likely not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in walking tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground edges (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely to come in contact with the toxic substances.
It is evident that over decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
He'll be removed today too.
Students put their buns burners on asbestos matts.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its magnificent isolating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their buns burners on asbestos matts.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed on websites.
And because of the innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or screw roofs, asbestos have normally been contained.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our property," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact of a woman affected was the departure of a garden crew in the 1970s.
So be careful how to ride your gardens.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see any more Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, perspective change was from the position of a doctor to the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna see any more Christmas.
That's it."
Mesotheliom is particularly dumb because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is spinned up and the fibres are inhaled, they can find themselves in the chest trap, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, " they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancer disorders in mesotheliom are less effective.
For example, the efficacy of an operation is hot controversy.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
You don't come around with the knife.
Because the cancer speaks "not very well on chemotherapy", which shows "activity", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham still fights Abbott.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultancy office for fellow workers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he presented himself happyly on calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, made it "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-torax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I hadn't had to be forwarded, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to be transferred and should wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom illnesses to be able to observe the best available treatments.
But if these treatments are finally failing, many affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realized that a very low burden also represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally admitted their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-quality compensation", since Lawson could not with absolute certainty prove that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a speaker of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the concerned cellar area in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesotheliom-sick persons who strive to compensate for a huge problem, to link the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom-related to accuse of a compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to find.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million £ funds supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove contact, but nobody can accuse.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have spoken to them in a normal replacement process - approximately £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom subjects that £350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time had not passed and Mesotheliom diseases find the companies and they could accuse them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law "not perfect".
But both money and Morgan admitted that, in view of seven deaths, a rapid action was needed daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham was Abbott in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," said Abbott.
You can see that in patients again and again.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you're getting worse very fast.
Graham Abbott undergone the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Follow-up scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-determining.
Again, Abbott undergone six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumours visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very hard.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or my wife show how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't be old with.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very societies and uncomfortable.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restraining.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to be through.
But for mesothelio symptoms, such conversations have not been made of hope, not of a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (such as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a violent security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to government election, demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong elections.
This approach is likely to kick the long-professed protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led to planning and mobilisation within a few hours after the explanation.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-faith candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong were lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vizegeneral Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants to choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct election law for the people of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course through a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates are to be allowed "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer where some of the largest and most publicly effective protests have been held in Hong Kong for several years.
The movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace is behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, whose organisers have threatened to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general election law.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central attendants had gathered in the rain before the headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organisers said that their movement has achieved a new level of civil disobedience and that they have planned protest waves in the next few weeks.
However, they did not provide any detailed information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers informed that the movement "was only considered the occupation of the central district as the last means, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will take place definitely.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures, including police forces and barrikades, were reinforced.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The increase in people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear grows that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement, as they jeopardized the business operation - the lives of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long they persist," said Regine Ip, who has long been criticizing the movement.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The government-controlled media of China also recently reported the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an inofficial referendum on the election rights of 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now transferred to universities where Freshmen is offered performances with the private aircraft.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have to cut their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company speaker said that there were no new bookings, since the service was just introduced, however, added that "study students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ very different in their expectations and claims from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as being rejected.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for university education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start study this month find themselves exposed to a crisis of living costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep steps with the strongly increasing invoices for the simplest life basiss before they can think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the home of students.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hanges up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the Blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race in addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you can find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People were forced to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they have to express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed to every day but which are not considered as "women's themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colors in their own country are besieged, the silence is annoying.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomia between race and sex problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now associate the topics of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor for Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lined and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for election law could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They decided to take advantage of women's election law, and the election law for black people should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you will be aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the election law in 1920, it took another decade until white women organised themselves against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "finger" with the problems that black women have dealt with since generations.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who have built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to preventive means are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but parallel reason for understanding a risk in the body - and opinions on the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on race topics in America are astonishing.
Christina Summers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far harmfuler than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their former criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently placed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help injurious young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that leads to mainstream feminism.
After almost 63,000 unattended minors attacked at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform will also come back to the surface - this time as a women's topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that for a re-review of the topic as a key topic of women, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"This speaks for itself," said Mercado.
When the large majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a afterhall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate makers, as it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The independent house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that his head had been beding on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo has been mistakenly published and has now been removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exhibition of the house Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the maker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In the social media, domestic sales provided interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey hosts a new millionaire after lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a happy winner who receives from the lottery on Saturday nearly 1,1 million dollars.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the Jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide conversational materials in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a win could take place.
Eight WA winners celebrated profits in the first division last month, a reasonable conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, one player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7,5 million just a few weeks before.
The victory couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allow them the possibility of a world trip and buying a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly 85 million dollars.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the gladiators were kneeling deep in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the recreational park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract far over 1,000 visitors yesterday who defeated the rain showers and the autumn cold and were relentlessly enthusiastic from the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful line of presentations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust fighting art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a more humorous and expert presentation and sent his men together into the ring to the heroic two-fighting in various gladiator gates.
First, the "provocators" were in line with rectangular and short swords as well as bones on the left leg and armshine on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and wrist, as well as iron gladiator helmet, bone and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who met the "securator" with a garbage net, three-sack and dolch, and after a short struggle hit the boys to the ground.
As the swords forced each other metallically, the shields created and the wrists flooded surrounded through the arena, that a fear and anxiety could become about the health of gladiators.
But on it the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to relive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Friend circle of the Roman Channel", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparing was a "Opidum Romanum" from the recreation park for one day, a Roman city, as vice-burger master Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today.
Remnants of this were also astonished on the Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced the water and energy supply and now, and manager Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms Diplom-Measurement Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineur teamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented Roman measuring instruments such as chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman Villaa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocoast, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Amazingly also the footprints left in the footsteps of two millenniums ago before they were burned by wolf and fuchs.
In 2011, the Ministry of Landdenkmalpflege at the Rheinland National Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord commercial park in Rheinbach.
It has found surrounding walls of a economic building with a dread to dry cereals and to paint.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural goods, explained Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations represented them in a glass vicine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a pully necklace.
The Villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans invaded in then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
With her, the children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tables as did the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to place mosaics themselves at the stand of the Glass Museum of Rheinbach Glassmosaiken and to use a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the Nature Center Eifel Nettersheim to paint the flour for a flood bread or a müsli.
With the originally built Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors travelled through the recreational park and also passed the impressive state of the urban gymnastry, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the rheinland-wide Roman year 2014, which is to remember the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with home- and history associations as well as the Watchberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered a lecture, a lecture, cooking evening, and guides for school classes and reminds us of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman Legionary will tell about his work on the Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offering a fun class in international understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and attractive Romans.
Adendorf's primary school is devoted to the Roman theme in the framework of a project week.
The Roman week is intended to make the numerous but frequent but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg re-experienced at the first glance.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminded of the foundation of the Berkumer Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is a burden on Western Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe struggle for the economy.
Markets are infamous - and international companies are on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major struggle to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest is rotten in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are overwhelmed - the virus has been difficult to add to the region.
Some international companies are already on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic," judges the Head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital of Monrovia.
The market only comes who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia was the hardest hit by the virus, but here alone more than 600 people were victims of fever.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease was in every angle of the country.
The virus also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Over 1,500 people have already died, thousands of others have died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies are exercising their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraws their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
Also the local traders and farmers react: only a few merchants leave their homes to get replacement.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, under quarantines, among other things, the important cookie and coffee beans are rotten to the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
"The people will be getting less and less traveling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert on West Africa's economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is getting short.
On the markets the stocks of basic food such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies principally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
Decisively, how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
With investors, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also stresses the government budgets of the States
The disease also stresses the government budgets of the affected States.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be strongly tightened by high health expenditure and also by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are evidently already in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly backwards.
Shelters celebrate her 50th anniversary
From 12 to 14 September, the Schützenverein "Tahnenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50-year-old foundation feast.
On high tours, the Tannenwald Schützenverein prepares for the 50-year foundation feast from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday 12 September, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday it will be the big blower shooting at 6:00.
Afterwards, in the large festival of the atmosphere evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbauam".
Blascapelles provide the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the great arrest at 14 p.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gauschießen.
A very beautiful view will be the 25 festival ladies with their dirndl.
The main chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Voracker have taken over.
The original term "Schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in room use and small caliber shoots".
The NS regime had in 1937 caused the unity to dissolve.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who, on April 30 in the guest house of Luke, lifted the "new" patrons' association "Tönnenwald" Berngau out of baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a shooter champion through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a uniting room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Guardian Association started with two teams in the round competitions at the "Luniter" guest house.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the first Gauliga.
The association records purzeled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, the numbers of members have also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" unit has no longer satisfied the claims of a modern shooting unit, the then board, led by Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Hardteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on May 8, 1988 Pfarrer Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the United Nations was certainly the 44th shooting, connected with the celebrated wee of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Guardian Association celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995, a group of bollers has been established.
Joseph Schmalzl became a boller reference.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerische Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of official work, the members of the United Nations have modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought the latest update of the technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performances of the Guardian Association.
Altogether, eleven teams are currently participating in round competitions: six air gun crews, an air gun crew, a sport gun KK1, one youth and two AH crews.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the round 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest Liga in Schützengau ANB) to the district Liga 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
Besides the shooting sports, events such as bocksticks, fashings and king'sball, unification trips and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the racing route
Tony Stewart's return to the racing route ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time, after his right front ripped in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focus on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart drove earlier on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went into a fairly good hope today for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the sleeppers and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup races go after his car hit and killed another driver at a ashway race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an examination of the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had joined the railway during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations due to the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-fold champion was welcomed when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12 position, Stewart was shortly afterwards in the first 10 and was temporarily on the fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got
Vehicle with no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collapsed with Stewart, both cars driving towards the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Searched for dance-gracious adults
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma, and Chief Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to competitors.
Like many other associations, the Jazz groups in TV Jahn also create the whole day class at the continuing schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now it's looking for increased growth for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two Jazz and Modern Dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Tree in the group of eight to twelve years, six in the group of twelve to 15 years," says the 20-year-old.
With more assets, the whole would make much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance will be free of charge on Thursday between 17 and 18 or Friday between 17 and 18.30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, in the training hours.
"The training begins regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographys are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from Folklore about classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of sociality.
"We're going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've been overnight in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Whoever's not Jazz dance, it can also get into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always get into school in the area of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who want Discofox, slow walzers, Vienna walzers, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may look and join.
Bulgarian prison overseers protest across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organised a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for recovery of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For one month the officials have symbolically protested against the new working hours and demand a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the trade unions of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations take place, the Director-General for the execution of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed the BNR.
The objection of prison employees is expected to be supported by members of the trade unions Association of Employers of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the eastern Ukraine, the prorussian fighters continue to march.
After severe fights, where Russian tankbataillone was claimed to be involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk airport.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers have been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the highest army leadership, without mentioning details.
Prorussian separateists shot off a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have, in their own presentation, shot off a fighting aircraft and two military hub screws.
Some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, according to the rebels informed Russian agencies on Monday.
Coastal Guard ships lowered
The opposers also claimed to have seen two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asovian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships had been shot on Sunday near Mariupol Harbour City.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev said to the transmitter 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several towns in the Donezk area had been controlled.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a missionary from the Eastern Ukraine should take part in this.
In advance, all stakeholders used their performances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
The NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukrainian crisis.
The NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels, the NATO is in accordance with the 1997 NATO Council of Russia.
However, the NATO CEO accused Russia of "one cracked fractions" of the agreement.
"Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not consider the NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
From documents and comments from Russian side, "that they view us as opponents."
Strengthen NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that they want to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readness Action Plan" that will be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas conversations
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new discussions to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were held for the next Saturday, said Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision from the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no longer received fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger has recently communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe relates about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will come "very clear"
Now the Chancellor again confess that.
A free letter for all complex details, however, is not.
Heavy concerns from the CDU against the car-maut have been grieving by the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke, after persistent resistance from her CDU, a powerful word for the introduction of a car-maut.
"To say it clearly: she is in the coalition contract, and she will come," said the party manager on Monday after meetings of the CDU top companies in Berlin.
However, Merkel was not determined on a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme, "definite parameters" were called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being continued to work on it.
However, the NRW CDU persists on its no to a wall right on all streets.
Merkel stressed that also Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively engaged in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the subject, he also spoke to Dobrindt about other possibilities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as in broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schüble had left a "Mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house checks its own concept to charge motorway investors with wall intakes - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned to develop the Cabinet Maut concepts against the Federating Minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to support all circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country chairman.
In that respect it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the topic.
Resistance to the plans comes also from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is fears that a wall affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded a series of CDU coalition loyalty due to the maut criticism.
The left views the plans as failed in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said CEO Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignate obligation in all the German streets to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to coalition contracts.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the wall via the VAT taxes.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misunderstanding for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and back marrow.
Charity CMT UK reported that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely suffering from CMT, which can lead to motoric disturbances such as muscle weakness, insecurity and curved toes.
Diseases also suffer from deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I always fell down and everything took longer.
I could never ride with the other children rollshoes or skateboard and was often in school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several operations to discharge her Achilles seasons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and worried about panic.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25 and then slowly lose all my abilities.
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17 years old, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, or you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworksman since the closing of the former troop training site
For nearly ten years, there have been no shots at the former troops exercise place in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, killing ammunition appears every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian album.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprinkled on the site.
An ear-depleting knall is shaking over the heartpiece of the biosphere area at the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at the troop exercise site Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core part of the Sweedian Alb area, which is opened on 13 roads for hiking and bicyclers.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington's area increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax reports for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia totally paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third growth year following the several years of declining reports in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue in the district, 56 per cent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of Marylands revenues are from companies.
Virginia achieves with 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, says researchers, resulting in an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year following the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the outcome also seems to be true for the Washington room.
Company in the district, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent in the course of a year.
However, the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes are nearly more than a fifth of the tax reports made by companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organisations who do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot only be accounted for the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenue also appears to be recovered, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly in all three places.
The increase in the district was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the most significantly smallest corporate income taxes in all three fields with 6 per cent (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A comparable study of the US Chamber of Trade at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower government and local company taxes are required and a better tax climate exists in total than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, the same set as Virginia, and the set will fall to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the company income tax rate by 2017 to 3 per cent.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in company taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in the general multi-defence income for the State and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be behind if the Federal Government's reduction in expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hope and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, broken in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the vice party secretary of the South China Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
The functionary of the Chinese Government Communist Party repeatedly returned to this concern of the Twelve-Million Metropole during the discussion.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was awarded Li.
Therefore, people also owned the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German Political Delegation, said to the host that he will be listening to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and joy," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines Mr. Li, and he smeded the host.
Then the Guangzhou functionary stood with a shearer rubber - but with red wine, served for dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewery art.
Tsingtao beer is broken according to the German purity commandment.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012, for economic reasons.
"It would reward again," the local politician proved convinced.
"Company between our two cities is increasing."
At the moment travelers had to take the way over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schafer-Gumble - the Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knower of Germany, agreed.
Maintenanced partnership
Guangzhou's vice-party hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the office for corruption claims.
The local party manager Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou functionaries is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is carried out by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his office in Guangzhou, he served as a top functionary in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers of Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The south-Chinese metropole on the perlflus is almost as strong as the whole Hessen with its economic power.
In the next year, she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reports Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was delivered to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today proved hopeful that the 81-year-old comic has recovered from her illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to the Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for heart stop at a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and monitored until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "ernst".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and increasing wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from today, more stringent environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can detect central data on an eye such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen values are applicable in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the castlers: they receive a unitary minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one expected to take over Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it seemed that the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was decided for a cool billion thing, and cooperation also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (most older) games a stroke of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up somewhat sadly, an example of the teaching book of a established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not succeed, as the company reported that it was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports rather than watch it is difficult to understand the attraction that is based on watching others during playing instead of taking the control console into the hand.
It's one thing to look a friend over the shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she slides through resident Evil, and something quite different to see a fool in the face of a fool, as he is shot 20 times in the Call of Duty in the head.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without own control over the perspective can be a pretty good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic era finish all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virus is not involved, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money of it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated in Amazon Instant video as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are encamped as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of the gaming," and the media shows no signs of scratching, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten Festival, some things were done on Sunday evening.
The concept of organizers was true.
Despite the strong raingun on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans arrived at the Open Air Fest in the Burggarden.
Sometimes the introduction had to be stopped.
"This was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organisers.
Salt wrist l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to be brightness at day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was shown early Saturday when the first visitors opened to the Open Air.
The organisers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supplies on the Burggartenwiese, salt seedlers, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings had made comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were required.
And that across the generations.
While the one on the ceiling on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others laughed at a quarter of wine in Vinothek, the grown up on the hipburg was a great attraction point for the smaller guests.
But even in child minking, volunteers had to do all hands full in the true sense of the word to become the Lord of the Andrang and to magic imaginative creations in the small faces.
The largers used the kikertics or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew set out of salt.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he shouted to the visitors, especially families were looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why a repetition of the big party will not be contrary to the next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem showed in a first balance on Sunday to the referendum.
He declared angry that the initiation had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too few powers.
The result: Some who had already paid no more came to the site.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler spoke of some 1200 visitors who were stumbling in the Burggarden.
There were problems in sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be taken to salt because of a tyre pane.
"They'll be there next year," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the visitors.
And that at bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will have to be made for the first time but have to be removed in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organisers have to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event side.
"You have taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very tight.
I think it's very good that some people don't just talk stupidly, but they're also really trying to put something on their feet.
Beware!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organisers remain a year to stop these criticism points.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's sign shrinks
It is not expected to be the same.
Rather, the available component is waiting to be used in the marked construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA space observation radar, the cover, the so-called Radom, is fully renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old.
But the size remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cup exchange
The upper quarter of the old cover is separated and taken off with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new cover is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should pass through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Chillenge lays up jaws
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her ice-called water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge went painfully below.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she pulled her cheek.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK circulated as much as her ice-called water was poured over her head that she injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, and while I did, my jaw remained simple," she said to the mirror.
Icewater is swallowed over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but it didn't work, the jaw was broken, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and almost made laughing in my pants, but I had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was delivered to the hospital to get the jaw back into the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going back to a strike soon?
Last time, there was constant distinction between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the dead Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfriende, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriend Wolfratshausen.
The views of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be different so far.
Now the two camps are moving together: discussions about a common approach should soon be held.
This is confirmed by the associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriunde) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we be able to come together once," says Sjöberg.
He believes that all members of both associations will be able to return to a strain in the future.
This will bring more visible successes to be seen.
While the Burgfriends around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest, the Burgverein around Sjöberg stands the "Excretion and Experience" of the site at the front.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the Burgfriende, was very pleased to see his own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he stands before the bourgeois friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we had the association activities rested from respect." This "think phase" had been necessary to "that it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfriends could also make a current atmosphere within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the Presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am convinced that someone will find himself." He does not want to apply himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much pleased".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He deserves Dimbath as a "Missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
By a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to advance the project." A "all-instelling feature" for the river city could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, Piffl believes that the project would be fundable through EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
"The idea of rebuilding, therefore, I do not want to personally throw overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something in this point.
Their aim is to document history first, "is important and good."
Then you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save in uni teaching books
Since the cost of uni teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay retail sales.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board informed students that, on average, spend more than $1.200 per year for teaching books and study materials, there were different options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The rental of teaching books becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university book shops, noted that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Inquiries in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the college book stores were rented last spring semester, said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus bookshops, according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be included in the specialized learning book dealer Chegg.com for $229.99.
Buy Used
If you don't care about the notes of other or normal traces of use, use books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes updates are not relevant for seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the costs of the latest issue.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for books used.
Rent
The rent of teaching books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after the course has completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself of the provisions of the shop where you rent, including the punishment fees which may occur for writing notes, underlines or traces of use.
Careful: If you don't return the book, the punishment fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books are also an option instead of conventional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of gross traders such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around in any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will next visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price definition of books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before a online order, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually reserved.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cash hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars in his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Syn City: A Dame to Kill For" only played 12 million dollars in his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" circumcised on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million in the opening week, while children's films like "Drackers made easy" also disappoint the revenues.
A article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children's films could be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "draches made easy" 2 as pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in movies for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film start that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 linen walls.
The results are based on the views of the cinema seekers and film critics and suggest that this year's video heat is equivalent to those of the last year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing sight habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix is due.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disneys' jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood production, netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on films by comics and prophesied a "Kernschmelze" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could certainly contain a real core.
However, due to the potential cash strikers to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The manufacturer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will be worried about the business."
When a few years ago the second table tennis district class was deleted for the punishment of the League division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever has not risen has declined.
Thus, Göttingen's highest class team, Torpedo, in the Oberliga Relegation, has avoided the decline, but only plays fifth class in the next season.
Four-class women of Torpedo remain in the regional liga despite their great doormarch.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weede.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserves come into the new association league, in the country league are no longer represented Göttinger Clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo Second in the National Liga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbed, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district liga plays as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, red white, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district liga, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are launched.
With every nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league of the SCW young people - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Cirkelligen start with every nine teams.
The Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Green, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Lenglern II are in the West Staffel.
In the East Staffel, there are Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no women teams on the circular level.
It is noteworthy that none of the six second classes of circuit shoulder strength, here the innovative and diversified circuit board will have to think about.
Nato Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
In the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered together in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so - called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us in the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Adolescents fled from the Blue Mountains
TWEE youthly bushanders were brought in security with the rope winds after they had been caught over the night to the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday morning in Govetts Leap in Blackheath for her tour.
Careful relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two were not returned home.
A search troop from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were fled out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable state with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalate government-violent protests in Pakistan
The about 1,000 demonstrations had been pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter restarted the radiation after just half an hour.
The PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured persons have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the withdrawal of the Head of Government to which they propose election fraud.
The police informed that about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, there were reconciliations of some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
A police officer was injured after hospital data.
At least three people had been killed in the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrations tried to insist on Sharif's residence.
They call for the withdrawal of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the Army Headquarters, the mighty military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without spending time and without violence".
The communication further stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The escalating violence has worried about the military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition policyer Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a withdrawal.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to retire," said Khan.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and province governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had endured peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them to insist on Sharif's residence in the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory at place three of the table.
With the 2:0 on Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a reconciliable end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the European League on Thursday reached an intermediate depth.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who prompted with green-white on the place three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on the Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with a success experience in the country game break with the second season.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defense Thomas Schrammel, who, with his glorious leader-volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, put the soft on victory.
"I thought I swallowed all the fruit from Thursday and snatched it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit a federal party on 13 November 2010 for the last time, it was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory to him.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid-Nachwuchs," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term basin blessur, scrambled from the left to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can do this position wrongly.
He deserved the gate, he already made some Assists," praised Barisic.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after just an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have been able to sign up.
"Thank God we have had a little luck today," also said Schrammel, who thus played on the breakdown of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the gambling was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "man had been better in many games before than today" against "the strongest crew that played in this season in this stadium".
The first three points since July 26, therefore, have proved that the crew's arrivals are intake despite: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Not less rejoicing for him, "that we finally played again to zero."
A lot of work during the country play break Also, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger are giving their start-up debts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Do not forget this," admonished Barisic, who lost over the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable in recent times."
Therefore, the country play break needs to be used to "slick wounds and add a bit in the physical field," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his rows.
One of those who think the break is specially located is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the crew, overwhelming pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic observed.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably also had a little luck, but at some point, happiness must come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He apparently urged to concentrate on the work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad as this has been shown in the last few weeks.
But we can't believe that it's all right now.
He couldn't dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young crew that I can help very much at the moment.
They stick to me in some phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the rapid contradiction "from the category of magic", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which was misrepresented by arbitrator colleagues.
The only claim I can make to the crew is that we were not in the direction of gate in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Indoor defense Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In general, more would have been in it.
Under this peak Ruh rules
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine luck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the rural area, the pictured copy is the "guite hockey" above the underwheat brown.
A holpriger footway leads up to the approximately 600 years old oak.
It passes to groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A little bit below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the environment and reminds with a range of more than eight meters of an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a tree steam suggests that it is a spiritual or mysterious place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishopsheimer Archive extra and asked older people from Underweißenbrunn to learn what family it has with the Gisseheiche.
The result of his investigations remained the rather noble explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underwheat well to the hardly roded and spoiled from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards exhausted from the rise should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its meaning back, because on the pastures actually weighs goat herds again.
The area has also been explained to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
But when you enter the stone collections, you should be careful, because the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for cross-dotters.
A hiking path leads from underwheeth brown to the tree, but is somewhere hidden.
Further ways are recorded, rising upwards and inviting to a widening hiking.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is searched for in our next task is rather rarely found in the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building can fit.
Where's our "chunk of Rhine luck"?

After weekly diving, Italy's Prime Minister and Chairman of the EU, Matteo Renzi, held the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of the EU's external policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, she will be the successor of Britin Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government newspaper La Repubblica represents the call for Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
In the end, Renzi hopes to put the left-handed party base on him to be calm, because Mogherini is assigned to this - though rather in a moderate manner.
Contrary to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, is the predominant opinion in Rome in order to make a political compensation.
For at the same time, the EU Head of Diplomacy becomes alternate representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The remaining agreement of the European Parliament is deemed to be secure.
Otherwise, President-in-Office Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) a "essential recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, known for her ambition, has proved to be the "estandard challenges" for almost two decades.
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began the promovated polytology in 1996 in the Youth Organization of the then Democratic Di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which in 2008 joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita to the current social democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Jungsozialists).
With the election in 2001 in the Left Democrat Party Council, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Department of External Policy, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional focuses on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Members in which she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Minister for Foreign Affairs.
If the PD has a better relationship today with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU's elections in May, then, as is mentioned in PD requirements, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The talks in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, thus lacking substance, are reported in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic Members, Mogherini's mistrustful realistic accents are being pursued and diffamated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian gas directly to Southern Europe, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi joined his duration as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first public visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken with angry in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kreml Chef to an e-mailing economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training on Monday at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg.
This includes an Azubi which has already completed another training in the company.

The socialists in France should "hold their mouth and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important alliance.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet circumvention has encountered disapprovement with the vast majority of French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
As a vital gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for the releasing of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to be "united" with the government.
However, Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprang sand into the drive where she appeared at a meeting of a desirable socialist Member and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the long-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant grave fights of socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls' government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that it would be a victory in favour of elections and would be ready for government.
The government party of France suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the legally directed national front was in the front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the socialist party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the term of office of Holland 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would lose patience quickly if the new socialist government did not achieve improvements in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must feel that things change quickly," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion dollars
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, leads advanced negotiations, according to experts in the industry, to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would be Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous customer while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
One agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could also end indefinitely.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker rejected a comment for Apollo.
The company located in Miami Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operate under the brand name Oceania and Regent, which jointly operates eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of 1.2 billion dollars, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is a total of about $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to be strengthened by the middle class in threshold countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice for the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a fusion with a cruise provider in possession of Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casinomic group under control of the Malayse billionary Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held a share of 28 per cent of the shares, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and TPG Capital LP private asset.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise shared in the original application documents for the exchange of Prestige Cruises over 82 percent of passenger capacity in American cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election.
A peking-faithful group swept nearby the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National Congress adopted on Sunday a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to govern Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority of the support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-faithing members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for opposing democracies to be authorised to choose and will cause pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to commit the Hong Kong financial site with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leadership fears that the call for democracy will expand to other cities.
After the publication of a Peking White Paper, which presented China's presidency over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special government region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organised a site in there.
Lis' interview is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connections office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they should gather themselves at the headquarters office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not see any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "state talks" with the East of ukraine
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government set up the fights against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and directly take up negotiations on the "state" of the deceased region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under control of the separatists in the Eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine should be re-defined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
But Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations at eye height with the pro-Russian insistents is in line with the strategy that it seems to follow since the start of the excretions five months ago: help for separatists in conquering areas and pressures on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija fake independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were conquered in March and April after Moscow had announced the Ukrainian peninsula Krim on 18 March.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently called the consumed area "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term that reminds us of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26th and during government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separateists are hoping to be "catched in their illusions," reports Itar-Tass.
"We need to begin detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of the society and the state status of the southeast of Ukraine, in order to maintain the interests of the living people there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to state in the context of the greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the chief leader for months to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kreml speaker on the correction of the "false interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulties to announce the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys from the time before the conflict revealed a wide majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over a area linking the Russian state area with the Crimea.
The five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home afe for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trade port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and pourery that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the introduction of the office on 7 June, proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take into account additives to the Constitution, with which greater control of their finances and the status of languages is given to the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in a sharp contrast to those of the Kreml and the separateist rebels whose arms and revolts are thrown against Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separateist leaders on the height of the eyes, followed after a further intruding of the rebells last week, after Russian troops and tanks had entered the Eastern Ocean along the former peaceful region.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the handstree, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, is the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500 000 inhabitants located between Nowoasowsk and the small access to the Krim peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a EU leadership meeting in Brussels and urged for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're standing in front of a point where there's no more back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the Ukraine Territory.
The EU summit decided no concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week in order to support the armed separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers likely included by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian fallscreen hunters captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal for Australian promises and Gabi Griko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no hole for his trouble about hackers, probably naked pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grrecko and a Who is Who stole the A Promis from Hollywood.
The film town is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal for promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tributs of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grrecko from Melbourne, it is said that private photos were also audienced due to a iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelsten, who had engaged with Griko last month, said to Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reported a news site that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings where she is located at the top without a pool.
Palmers' films include "Liebe is indefensible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It is a terrible injury to the privacy."
Schauspieler Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Hacked pictures from a cell phone are nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
Just legally, it should not be tolerated the further spread of stolen images.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour, which was one torment for one, represented a light training for the other.
In one, however, all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably had a good sleep last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberursel Brauhauset drove with the bike to the Feldberg last night.
For good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater, especially as the participation on the 8th Wheels on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) gave him personally a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - great!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause basket?
No, if I had stopped, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the upper-short city parliament, many of the 718 attendees quenched to mountains yesterday in the early tour and came close to the exhaustation, but happy on the plateau.
Others, however, found it easier to overcome the 11 kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole green politician from the circuit day - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the start ("Every quantity of professionals, there is the goal of arriving!"), then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a railroad, as did Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had made herself on the way together with Frank Green iron.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, here we are glad to be there - a trip we would have made anyway today", said Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was driven down to the upper wallet in the morning, and immediately thereafter to trample back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swooped home at 9 a.m. in the Sattel in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Friten-Toni".
For the chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, cycling tours are simply included over the Feldberg.
He had pitched 40 minutes with his 6,5-kilo wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I would like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "a ambitioned racer".
He must be, too, because he was on the "fixie wheel", they're also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only the 20 hikers who went up to the top of the white wall and the footstand, but also a jogger, who pulled a car ripping with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said, "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special slide trail, just that he holds the sleeve itself." So the man is certainly his own sleeve dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
It followed the first bicyclers and runners at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers released.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip.
Next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to Feldberg to the security of the participants.
