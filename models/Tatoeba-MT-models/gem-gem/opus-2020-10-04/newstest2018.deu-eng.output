Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An irrational announcement where youths are supposed to meet today.
A crop chapel where now is buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Clay gardeners manage the unique ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's nervous when maps are not present.
This is known to anyone who had to get upset, because the car navi instead of a surrounding road showed a green grass.
The historic maps of the digital Bayern atlas, a offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are everything other than current - but that is why it is very insightful.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flash carpet that you do not recognize as such.
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called 'original sheets'.
These originated, according to the Bavarian measurement administration, between 1810 and 1864 and originated in the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally declined with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a sophisticated Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thus the Bayerian measurement management.
The original sheet for Munich is from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison Previous/Today is the most impressive in the example of the country capital.
The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is a substitute who appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was placed 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munchner district.
Today, subsending is in the middle of the city.
The houses of consignors are focused around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, there is nothing but fields - at the first view: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: manually numbered walking pieces from the so-called "reception", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer farmers - but clothing gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large green area describes the northern part of a substitute.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the October Festival, was actually still a pasture - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original sheet you read not only the street names "am guesteig" or from the height "On the Lifts" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeld Street, people were once locked up with crazy ideas.
In 1858/59, the Munchner Circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Liften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gottden directed the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of the so-called irrations.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the museum Haidhausen, who has been engaged in an exhibition with the organ.
At first, 280 patients had been placed, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the circular irrigation in hair in 1905.
There has been the Isar-Amper Clinic of Munich-Ost since 2006, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munchner Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a youth home with training companies.
West is the football square of the TSV Munich East, eastern housing houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural rejection to the building of the Irrish Institute, which was destroyed in the Second World War in bombing attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Haupt Platz" at 1856, the Cauing Finger Street was called "Kaufinger Gaasse".
A decisive change also brought World War II into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of allies risen many holes into the city centre.
A great thing remained until today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval cup chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where this day the pre-works and on April 5, 2017, the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn strait.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with the air picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group Published Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African travellers, visitors and Missourianers to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to give extreme caution, since a number of questionable racial events have recently occurred and are mentioned here in the entire state," says the Group's opinion.
A newly adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, and the criminal prosecution authorities of the State aiming unproportionally on minorities, the group caused to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are struck or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer gasoline during the state travel and was taken into account by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report from the Office of the General State Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black drivers in the state are more frequently held than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be willing to bring deposits or to let relatives know that they travel through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hatred crime report programme, which classified the State as the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company of housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws which required local criminal criminal authorities to arrest people for immigration infringements, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profileing.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Widetone project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezan project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU birthday delegates Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on the site.
At the courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Places Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights in his holding, in which he manages 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, cared for 40 milk cows and as many young animals and hosts in five apartments.
The "sworn milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, said Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the breeding tune project "elementary".
I can't make profits on such bright areas.
The greenland area provides a lot of work, many things need to be processed with the motor sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.
He took over the parental operation in 2003 and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not operate bio.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality recognized the importance of the breeding tune project and is happy about the Leader promotion."
For the costs of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the foresting of the areas could be pulled out for a long time.
"The largest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," the mayor stressed.
The farmers are often in criticism because of promotion.
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were collected in 2013 through the promotion of breeding.
The open-up area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be cultivated until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was funded via Leader, one quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of breeding.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the toes," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and farmers it won't work."
Peter White also stated: "The best foods are being produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote weidezäunen.
The aim is to keep the black forest open.
The presence of a funding circulation referred to by the LPR is required.
In addition, the area to be cultivated may not be cultivable (inclination above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by forestry.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezan project 2018, the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 participants who want to build nearly 16 kilometers.
The open-up area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully incredience of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a hot fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President on drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have aligned him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning attributed to her, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
When Miller Acosta blasphemed, "I don't want to discuss a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original Statue of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the exciting words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely, / the evil waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "depressive waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is in fact a conflict about America's importance.
Lazarus - and her friends, who tried to put their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female representation of freedom in a misuse of classical representation.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The link of poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wing for a long time.
The great screwhale Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the liberty statue invites nobody but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the overnighted world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.
It is intended to carry the flash of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The flash is not supposed to light the way into the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh hit something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the view of perception.
The great fascinating act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, distressed, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their flash shall not light the way, but shall enflamme the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the British team
Neil Black, the performance director of the United Kingdom's light athlete, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which started on Friday.
Black believes that "self has to develop something special in Scotland" and the light athlete of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British light athlete: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street neck.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal adversaries, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be approached against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain talk was incredible," says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will join the 400-m heads at her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British crew.
Scotland's best number of athletes in the World Championship has been seven, which have been achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The Middle Trailer Muir is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1 500 m and the 5000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot was at Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special feature of being team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Certainly I am very proud of all the scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podies.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not buy for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from internal policy to its political principles.
He screwed in criticism, surely.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid we are led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberty Union accused him of this early this week.
The staff of the governor released the complaint as freely, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's particularly important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republic governor in a surprisingly popular democratic state.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his choosers and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people on the governor's side - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the whips online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a practicer, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not proficient.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crime.
"I kindly commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment field of the news broadcast "The Post".
"I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the Governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call "pre-language".
The Facebook year makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guide articles, to burn or arrest demonstrators and to silence them.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for harassing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to the United States District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a chooser from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers took his lead.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions down.
Petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the online documents of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are part of the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next year in Archerfield Left to the Endrunde before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new exhibition site and serves as a tourism message in the name of the founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous defendant of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year-old career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open, because it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returned to action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad that it has gone so far."
With the trio on the field, the former Masters Best Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmurir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with one inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.

Reducing lung cancer death by passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoke.
The result is that scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
"After our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smokes per year," said Heko Becher.
As a comparison, he carried out his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 cases of lung cancer due to passive smoke per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in the Villinger Street is in full course and "is somewhat in the time," says the leader of the Fred Heinze building.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much is hidden, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly obstacles the construction work, represents a major problem for the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of the car drivers before red amplifiers and locking grids is already huge," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are allowed to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kosturz from the Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were very hard already.
But fortunately, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use herd.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the disturbed Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled knob is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the lehbod - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with dirty water from the nearby mosquito.
An eimer in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dare to walk around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was introduced in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders were to vote by public hand collection in front of the crew troops.
An existing movement, which touched on independence against Dutch rule, turned rapidly against the Government of Jakarta, who maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is devastated. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province Capital to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive with the car rental.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo cavities and of wave-bleach roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, silent because journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this clothing," says Degei, indicating their lively, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and their bright rock.
"Before we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the people live under poverty and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport declined in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
These riches, however, are a source of distress for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an emerging presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars to a single officer for local military citizens and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass deaths in Papua's tribal hoochland in the 1970s were murdered by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" says a report from 2016 by the Erzdiözese Brisbane, which contains reports of horrors of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal destruction of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as events occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened themselves, since Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic immigrants come from the populating islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanesian warning cantines sell brown chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai-inhabitant who moved to Jayapura Province Capital.
"It cost the local papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian State President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the Volksmund, promised the inequalities and injuries in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the inhabitants feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis dedication in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs in front of a warehouse fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The scared children told them that they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers hit her sound and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drunk hunted and struck the group with their guns, said victims and Witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and the things escalated the next day.
Some 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the waita dance – running in the circle and a bird song imitating – by Papuas Mee Pago stamm.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left hand joint," he said TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the balls came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin was a witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and investigated his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who as many Indonesians only carry a name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Officer of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said to reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Polizei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the next day 'filtered'.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to deal with the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to fix historical violations of human rights.
But the excuses almost started immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that have to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto took a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, which was charged by the UN for "crime against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already attached, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai sacrifice accepted such claims with cruel ignorance.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he said.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Oppressed village inhabitants protested from the company's location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But inhabitants say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid there will be vengeance," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness as the injured ones were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament called on the involved officers to take account of and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the territory.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribals of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebellian army who claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking trackadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years thousands of people were arrested in Paniai and willingly preserved under the pretext of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is likewise beyond reach.
The people here cultivate everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leave vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities between the local papua and the new migrants have grown, which have been in greater number since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to better trained and richer migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the capabilities necessary to manage its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain stressed.
In the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the adjunct Asian director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis' election campaign, to abolish the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development, were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's worst eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen support for the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, under the leadership of the human rights messenger, Jayapura, on 4 May, broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the papua says that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, except that they live under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and fears, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on an area precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not let the responsibles forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire records the 'Torch' cloud scratcher of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire found his doorbook in one of the world's highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 meters high, 79-stage buildings.
It is the second fire, which in just two years squeezes through the high house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept and we have risen in the fire alarm and in the crying of the people.
We ran down the staircase, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said one inhabitant who stated his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection Authority said that the units of fire combating at 4:00 p.m. local time (0:00 GMT) wiped the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on the provision of accommodation for the persons concerned.
The incident can re-experience questions on the safety of materials used in the outside areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from clothing, external clothing to decoration or isolation.
In the UK, the police said that she believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Greenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June, where about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup Reform: More Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the necessary two-third-multipleness.
Thus, though often very long, the five-sats classics that have been highly estimated, remain the traditional application.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of the ITF President David Haggerty was hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work on improving the application.
Not even the vote had been made after many objections before the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host law in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, the requirements in matters of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media terminology before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings prohibited items into the plane, finds out an inquiry
A survey on flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously forbidden objects were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while wearing accidentally prohibited knifes or other objects with sounds.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered lately that they were wrongly travelled with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey in more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most frequent objects that were deliberately swollen to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted, knowingly carrying objects with sounds through safety control, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is not surprising that people who carry the best smuggling - knowingly or unaware - were the most frequently flying through security.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about the liquids they can take or how much of it.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest quantity of the liquids consumed by the TSA are.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as butterfly.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-tusendsass Elon Musk is happy to show with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far noted that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unlawful reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures in turnover increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time revealed the latest quarterly balance a different, less glossy number: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently purchased the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.
Now Musk admits: 63,000 of the total 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Criticists have repeatedly pointed out that it is only unlawful reservations.
In annulment, Tesla fully pays back the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment".
At the moment there are 455.000 such unlawful reservations, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analytists.
That the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem so far, however, the Tesla Chef does not believe.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not the demand, but the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 is supposed to be - all models together - 5000,000, 2020 one million.
The demand is evident.
Musk says that there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you today order a "model 3", you can expect to be delivered at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to run his nail new production roads that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum exhaustion.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the inconsistency of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in a few years.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in the Obama era's rules to reduce emissions
One day after being accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Authority, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smog caused air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved the needs of the state environmental authorities to reaction faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the appeal which had been raised against his previous position in a federal appeal court.
It is a deadline that declined on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil-near ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time, study the plan and avoid "intervening in local decisions or disabling economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental protection rules for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned into blocking or delaying regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal relapse for the Pruitts Regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methaneleks.
In a opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turnover on ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely complying with the new standards.
"Before former administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited for the accusation of activist groups and others, and in an agreement fixing the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who declared the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use his "requirement to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "base on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in the Congress call for a comprehensive reconstruction of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the Senate to vote.
New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that the EPA had accused this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection have rejoiced over surprising change in courses.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological cruise of the Trump Government, offering environmental pollutors and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: At the anniversary of the Church of the Mountains, the old cemetery in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday 16 July at 16.30 a.m.
Whether his idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumling their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique small town."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Kapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergic documentary book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei therein" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document was found on the Tumlinger Mountain, besides the unique parish church, also a dominant court, which belonged to the Church or the Patronat right and was not reversed.
So there were people living there too.
According to the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the subdorf and the Oberdorf, which are currently recognized in the local picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old cards from the time around the year 1600 understood these historical circumstances.
The right of the cartridge originated from the early medieval own church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a parish remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church as well.
This was related to the right to use a parish or to suggest a new parish to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two breaks in Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded 1692 for the first time, but later had to be issued in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were beaten and the watch sails were stolen.
The roof was unbleached.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the cansel and church chairs and used them as a burnwood.
Remnants of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilarius was aborted.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year Night of 1834, a storm divided the church tower and half crashed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cancelled.
Only the current tower branch remained a witness of the 750 - year - old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter wasem are the successor of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, invite to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilarius chapel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasiums Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Introduction is from 15.30 p.m.
In order to reconcile the Serenade, a circumcision will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view of pastures to the forest," the organisers present the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumling and hearing.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade Organisator Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check the approval of windwheels
"Boisheim has no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The "Boisheim Association" called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The Association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nete, since at the time of four only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are essentially possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone leads to an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the area use plan - which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of a planning requirement, the issued approval is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim, "rejected".
Current state of things: The City Council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; there is still an authorisation from the district government.
Recognition: "In this case, the granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind energy plants is excluded from planning law."
The circuit confirms the entrance of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the fourth circle last week," explained a speaker.
The circuit takes it to the opportunity to review the matter again.
However, they do not predict that the procedure is stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circuit did not intend to express itself on Thursday on the argumentation of the Association of Boisheim.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four wind wheels every 200 metres high on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Foursen is directly involved had concluded pace contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares.
The construction of the four wind energy plants is intended to cover the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 p.m. at L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was hurt deadly.
Two other persons were easily injured.
The country road remained locked for hours.
According to police statements, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the context of the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother as accompanying the L 333 went towards Bogel.
City and traders plan "Home Shopping" weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are supposed to re-discover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants into the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Commerce, Christian King, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is supposed to make customers aware of what offers are available to their own city beyond the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the businesses of the city centre are to invite to "shopping at midnight".
The action is not only aimed at the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian King.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the industrial and commercial chamber.
This leads to a further stage of the "Attractive Innenstadt" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the well-feest, as well as sales open Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is intended to be reopened or reopened.
These include couriers and tourists.
But many inhabitants would also have lost the city in shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to the living of the city centre - up to the tenants, the holdings of the entire city and associations.
It was true to overcome the lethargy, which was partly broadened, with a network, the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK centre in Mühlhausen, informed that the third "Home Shopping" day, for the first time, took part in five Thüringer cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy Town and Bleicherode.
The day was to "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance to the common welfare of our cities", said Strict.
The action under the management of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
At a gas explosion in the US City of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more injured, some of them difficult.
According to the firearm, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A missing person was later also secured dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an unfortunate cause, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the vacation period, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on mexican phone calls after sucked transcripts because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump in a telephone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the U.S. President was disgusting him because he had plunged the wall publicly. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia would take over "smoothly", "mys" and "dumb" and that the existence on the trade that was communicated by the government of Obama would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacher: Activists bring back racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of audiences in rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns appeared to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a man of mid-aged age in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his sigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n -----r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Take him out of the car!"
Screaming screamed the silence when a young black man was scattered from the accompanying seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22, is just a presentation.
But then when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of the audiences were kicking out very real sucks.
Since 2005, civil lawyers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were aligned by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of the murder.
"It's really incredible that in all these years there has been no single person arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the list.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congress delegate in the state of Georgia and a lifetime citizen lawyer.
For him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
On July 27, 1946, a court doctor lays a bed towel over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil lawyers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the Black Citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote at the precipitation campaign in summer.
Approximately at the same time as the choice, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - claimed to be down because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they turned away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it appears, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal persecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and disfellowshipped the identity of witnesses."
Brooks still forms it more spectacular.
"It was an electoral Massacher," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are registered and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual presentation of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their presentation is visible, incredible and is justified in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that it is no longer existing in America.
It's hard to look at, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lightning, because then we are confronted with its horribleness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-regisseur.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams and presses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughs.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still chilling.
"I just don't believe that white people then said a --- he."
"But," was one of the other black actors.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And precisely there, the energy moves in space, a feeling of kameracy replaces the unpleasantness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays sad lobre "Strange Fruit".
Their voice breaks with every second word.
Approximately 100 meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators removes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple are coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s pushing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spensive.
When the last notes of the song come out, Greene invites the quantity to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the breast body and whisper each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynch seal and dilute their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit that played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms weeping, the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair from Atlanta talks about the presentation with a black pair that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left the feeling of performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... to come from people who look like you yourself and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lightning is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The presentation is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's true if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat it."
"Good damning" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a bunt-frivole scenery before giant, six-stage scenes.
The turning beans (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally show a shameful street neck as well as wall rest and daneerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, where the Rhine daughters pose as rock girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind Castorf's lead motive - money, power and greed - that is drawn through his "ring" inscension.
The three purity daughters - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), crushed a body in Hollywood Manier in the bagroom and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are celebrated stormically, who formally bows his hands to Merkel-Rout.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra that appears for the first time on the stage - in view of the great heat again in lower recreational clothing.
It was expected with tension to appear by Frank Castorf and his board.
If he had to have a valid pepper concert over himself in 2013, there was a great rejoicing five years later in which the single "Buh" call was undergoing.
Captain Katharina Wagner must have liked it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she had said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also become an understanding of its viewpoint.
I'm taking a positive revelation.
Max Quantity works as volunteers
They are working in several places in their volunteer year.
Where?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture stock exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked on school in the open whole day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a late volunteer.
Why is that?
Amount: I made an abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, cancelled successfully.
I realized for myself that it's wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the ground, perhaps at the focus, really.
And was it so?
Amount: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in social life during the winter semester.
I will study twice, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office of Herne and study at Hamm at the University of Education.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always a matter of where you're making your FSJ.
You can do it from age home to youth work - in all sorts of aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partially in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Surely, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people shaped heads, who have a very different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family, always needs to be individual.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching anxiety?
Amount: I'm not the guy for that.
It's a area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are negative moments too, but life is just like that.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to re-experience the business
On Friday, the British Education Group Pearson said that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediary by 72 per cent, since another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures the company faces.
In addition to his previous restructuring, general director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, he has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan for another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to re-experience a business that was taken by the fast step to digital learning.
The company that had sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the view for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: Nato-Soldate killed in suicide attack
A suicide assault attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were hurt, an explanation of the Nato reported.
According to unauthorized local reports, three civilians also died in the event in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
A Nato opinion says that the explosion was done on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-made improved explosion".
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civil victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a chitical district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had done this attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the most fatal military attack in the country since the US troops in 2001 defeated the Taliban from power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani in recent weeks.
EPA reverses the decision to delay the smog rules after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Authority has suspended a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government in order to ensure that the States are obliged to reduce the emissions caused by smog, a day after 15 States declared the agency for the step.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to forward the so-called "Ozone Destinations 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with countries.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in the fact that we respond to our government partners," said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in an explanation.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone requirements - in which pollutant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to return to a wide range of environmental requirements on behalf of former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, according to Trump, to stimulate economic growth.
However, efforts have led to the relapse of democracies and nature protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that breathing air that contains ozone "can reduce the lung function and enhance the breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
The Community wants Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: with two contradictions, the municipality of Fluorn wines decides to set up a Community area in the future senior residential facilities.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjallen.
Although it will last until the so far belonging area of the church community is owned by the municipality, there is no longer a prevention of planning for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
At the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality suggest that such a Community area is not just a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the Senior Rights of Residence, but openly in the municipality.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn will be reimbursed by funding.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community space, according to Tjaden, would be eligible by 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal the investor that he does not want to throw any knobs between his legs in this respect, it provides for the finding that both Sattel - which is linked to environmental construction - and Pultdach - would be possible to reduce the level of trading and make construction more economic.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, unanimously he happens to the board.
It's not that easy in the Community space.
Daniela's call refers to the many own buildings with which you're not going straight forward, and now you're rejecting from the window at the community room, she says, "I'm doing hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely opposed to the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It looks after a hidden subsidie in any case to assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but it will be a real, marketable counterfeit, in case of doubt, is the contrary.
Staiger's request to split the decision proposal accordingly finds three advocates.
Thus, two contradictions of the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision this way, we take a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Wheeler is thrown on the road
When crossing the street, a 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was captured by a car and severely injured on Wednesday.
As the police informed, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the way to Hilden with his bicycle on the road of the Black road.
The Senior wanted to cross the railway in the height of the road At Buchholzer Busch.
A driver who drives in the same direction gave him priority.
However, when the Langenfelder travelled on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to counter traffic.
He collapsed with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern München has to abstain from David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to suspend the game against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund to the first duty game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the supercup against the pocal winner.
The staff care at the German football recordmeister Bayern München is increasing before the supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also abstain from David Alaba in the Duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the monks Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good last time."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my crew shows these qualitys.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "tough, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights draws the fans into their ban.
The party is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football Liga (DFL) informed on Friday.
Wander in the heart of star to star
In the rear, the first "star path" is to be created.
This is planned by the Association of St. Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information by many visitors, said it.
He connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper heart.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is intended to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receiver plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path should be expanded by train.
"On the star path the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it is farther away.
It also means in which the star image is a chosen star and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Natural Protection.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly seen with a simple eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Planetary Planetary, there has been something similar to the planned starwing – the planetary road.
Starting before Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the hainberg and the stars - as well as an "external" location in Diemarden (commune equals) with the planet Sedna.
The sets with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the end point of the dwarf - are precisely set in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
So the earth shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the exact 75 meters away sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the pitch with Pluto.
So walkers are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fast star, but it would last half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be at a collisions course to increase the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unattended World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 a.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lo maakko-Manager Egis noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former feather weight," remembered Garcia.
"I have risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let us give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxs need this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lo maakko has to fight with a 135-pounds debt this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lo maakko as "a huge fighter", and he may be taking part in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomachenko kept on with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks he's seeing the three-fighting champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted to see the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show stroke strength, then box.
Both said they could feel the moment that was built up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tyres
In the event of an accident on the A7, four persons were partially severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 16.30 a.m. just before the connector marketwidth after a tyre pitch.
The truck swooped right into the bowl, where he swallowed himself and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured ones by the rescue service, the A7 was locked north for about an hour, and then the traffic could be transmitted on the left track to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dreierkette works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the seasonal intake against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first seasonal game, with the result, there would not have been the two counterways at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"There were two counter gates too much, and we have to be careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the irish mountains, the triangle chain will also be further optimized.
And a gate after a release, the fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will be better managed after the experiences in preparing the three chain than with the four chain.
"Not yet I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we're just in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we are still better harmonized and we do not make so many play errors in building."
Of course, Hoffmann is also driving to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a misleaded start, you don't know.
The performance could be all right," said Hoffmann.
"If we are standing on Sunday with four points and can focus on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a ordinary seasonal intake."
His trainer didn't want to know about that.
"The start into the season I only turn after six to eight games days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to talk about a advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be discontinued early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann believed that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are currently," says the internal defense of the Fortune.
Although the guests from the Rhineland are going as a small favorite on Sunday to meet at the final (fast) stage of Aue.
"That we wipe them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance is positive in just one defeat against the nine games.
"There is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the beginning," explains Fortunas Chiefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And that's how Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subject to a new medical assessment method of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Recht Medicines Agency) has started carrying out tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish migration authority (Migration Agency) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less than a year.
To date, the Forensic Medicine Agency has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed over 18 or over, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicines Agency, the results are constant in the past months.
"We don't see any great difference in statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the investigated person is 18 years or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knees, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologs, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity to see whether they went through the puberty before or later as usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of wrong assessment of a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is less than 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Fully in plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg goes well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, construction leader at the Department of Strasbourg and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time on all three reconciliation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building end is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wavebow bridge of concrete, dressed with red buntsand stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three buildings are now carefully renovated.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red buntsand stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a border fixture that is also used as a operational path.
The southern part of the bridge is intended to use a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap on Friday.
Then the walking path is to go on.
The particular thing is that it is complete parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps.
Special finger tip feeling has required the transmission of lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The inhabitants were informed about the project in the preliminary field of the work by handbooks.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the Sammelweier in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is trackfully regulated by an ampel.
For the construction at the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseineineingang, the road in the bridge is fully locked at the height of the hotels "Tahnhof" and "Seven Linden".
The cost of the three bridge anchorages totally amounts to EUR 700 000.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potatoes salad
It is not so frequent that parties are pulling on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it is together, which otherwise is hard to put under a hat.
The parties represented on the circular day of the volcano egg (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a wide alliance that shows peaceful flag this day, because AfD invites Rondell to the "great election campaign" poster.
And known names start - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, forms the Spitzenduo for the Federal Day election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event on the site do not want to listen to the AfD teachers, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The eggs remain bright."
Originally, the city-picnick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place at the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum A world and one of the most important organisers, is very happy: "Tell, how many people have come together here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "ur German potatoes salad that the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials after Gerolstein, she shows presence mainly at the railway station, which is only a few meters away from the places of events.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulcan Islands that he tried to find such an event and get the surgery.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but got a dismissal there because of the already built Laurentius churches there were not enough parking places.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is glad that "we can have such a nice event here."
In view of the event at the Rondell court, he says: "This is the good right of people, main cause, it remains peaceful."
It also does: On the Rondell court at 20 p.m., a band provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rhine-Pfalzian AfD Chairman Uwe Boy.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestagwahl, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour will take the AfD event, the guests on the premise have a longer breath, but there is also an order to clean up shortly after 21 a.m.
The police can descend - no special events.
Posaune meets Trompet
A hearing with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli there is in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trompet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or also "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in the blasmusic.
Both solists are winners and prizeholders of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the renowned concert building Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments but also to merge the limits of the various genres.
So Johann Sebastian Bach comes together with the two as well as in a new garment, Daniel Schnyders' "Weltmusic" is united with Bulgarian folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" of Jazzecho prizemaker Nils Wogram, mixing classics, Jazz and the free games into a fascinating whole artwork.
This core part of the programme was first carried out this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart quite openly about their biexuality.
"If I bite in grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?"
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood Star was Robert Pattinson, who finally was bitterly distinguished.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was really in love with every one I dated.
Or do you think I'd played it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed seriously in it.
So it's never confused or disabled me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
Especially below, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she was rather dressed like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bubble.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'You girl, be proud of you."
Especially to the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that irritates me.
And maybe some call me unthankable, but I do not like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced at Thursday night with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a democratic governor."
The proclamation broke out in joy.
"I'll change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee delivered an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said: "The party change of Governor Justice is another struggle for a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work on making our country great again."
"With only 15 governances and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership and is unable to find a positive, agreed message," said the RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in an explanation to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apologies for doping scandal
The world leader of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, commended on Thursday, which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport.
Russian light athlete CEO Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF convention on the early evening of the Light Athletic World Championships that the exclusion of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were kidnapped in competition gold and silver medals".
In spite of its comments, the IAAF Convention voted for maintaining the ban that was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole convention were pleased that the Russian Federation had realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reformed."
Coe said he was also "joyed" that Russia accepts the criteria for his re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the convention supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral actors in the light athlete world championships that start on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reconstitution.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Traurage act for crashed soldiers in Mali
At a grief celebration in the North Hexic Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed at a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Dom under high security arrangements.
The defence minister Ursula said nothing about the Leyen (CDU).
She called the two pilots who died, however, "constructors of her expertise".
"We are defeating ourselves before this highest victim they have offered in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their shafts were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the federal war to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church took off.
Then the grief celebration began in the family circle, close friends, representatives of the federal war and politics.
These were also the Prime Minister of Hesse Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Federal Defense Volker Wieker.
Sad guests laid down roses, the family stood arm in arm on the sargs.
Before the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
The Defense Minister of Leyen called the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and experienced their deployment.
The Chief of Stab had built the flight operation of the Tiger Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, among which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew couldn't turn the crash away, no one would have been able to."
No doubt about the UN mission in Mali showed the Leyen minister: the operation is dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country we are only separated from by two states," she said.
After the grief celebration, the boxes were brought out of the court.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was what the king's house informed on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish monarch is accompanied in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The imagehauer Bjørn Nørgaard already prepared a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be accompanied in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hole because he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also declared the title "Prince Festival".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the Chief Speaker of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last rest of the 83-year-old will be finally, be still unclear.
However, he intends not to be accompanied in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
He worked at the Themse in the French message.
While his later wife always fled to the people's sympathy statements, Prince Henrik had a severe position in his nearly 50-year-old reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "In a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I prefered wine instead of beer, silk steams instead of stripsocks, citrons instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia Tabak and those in this country had the reputation to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope to be careful.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
It was the same as two mistakes!"
Minister President Weil wants to re-evaluate rapidly
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Niedersachsen
Nedersachsens Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is resigned after the loss of the red-green majority of governments for a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
That is why, on Friday, Parliament's resolution was resolved.
Previously, the surprising excursion of a Green-Delegated from their country-day fraction in Lower Saxony had brought the government of Minister President Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover thus lost its little one-stood majority in Parliament to opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Department Elke Twesten justified its step with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in its electoral circle in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CCDU Group Head Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take it.
CDU and FDP have together 69 seats in the Dutch country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be regularly chosen on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green government now needs to decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil considers it, however, essential that the land day decides as quickly as possible its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further approach on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the country day to withdraw confidence from the Prime Minister and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally purely tested," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonablely examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of Black Green.
The Greens urged the deceased Members to return their country day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she returns her country day mandate, which she has received over the green country list, with immediate effect," the country chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner informed.
The Group Chairman of the Green Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of Every Twesten extraordinarily."
It has deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even in the background that there was no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD-Cancel Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Lower Saxon Greens every Twesten to CDU as a traitor.
"The behavior of the former Greens in Niedersachsen is not only betrayal to the voters, but also betraying the Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The Twestens exit costs red-green in Niedersachsen the majority.
The politician puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country "in her injured negligence and in her fruit," criticized the SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigent game in Lower Saxony and attempts to hit political capital from it."
Niedersachsens CDU Group Manager Björn Thümler would like to recommend his Members to take every Twesten into the CDU.
The group head of the SPD on the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, asked Twesten to distort the result of the 2013 country day election with personal career.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Greens had a shock thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) interviews the RedaktionsNetwork Germany (RND) talk and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know now, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the teacher is not really taken by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my House has immediately set up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the fact that Germany is concerned.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has to ensure, as the manufacturers do, that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue content exceeds 0,005 mg/kg for eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unbelievable eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the companies are not guilty.
Sitting production companies and consumers on the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies do not have direct debt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to the presumed illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of staff or even of firm competence?
It was just the official controls that discovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
That is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transmission to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may occur is crucial.
I have already repeatedly made it clear that I expect an indispensable information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable foods.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food economy, consumers are rightly upset.
The planned fund has brought manufacturers, traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food suppliers is not acceptable and must be discontinued immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the situation will be clarified quickly and indefinitely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization, which monitors the European game, has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournament.
Financial fair play rules that were launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must sometime prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy out the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can definitely loose the money so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the energy-rich family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players but must counter taxes with legitimate sources of revenue, allowing them to take the Break-Even point in their football related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrawn their support.
In 2011, the FFP shifted from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the crew and to build a global brand - should become a harder issue.
During the current three-year FFP investment period running by 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen in Ungnade in 2015 by the Presidency, his UEFA follower Alexander Ceferin continues to work on reducing excessive expenses.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a standard, it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that for the next five years the amount of EUR 44.4 million can be shown in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of EUR 60 million ($82 million then), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to override their financial supervision by diluting their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a catarical company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this to be a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was abolished by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the WM 2022 Organisation Committee.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 argued that Neymar will become WM messengers and that such a manöver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous penalties against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to avoid the rules.
The UEFA had no preliminary conversations with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has gained over 10 million euros with a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's removal by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is in possession of an American sports physician, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a association, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large stakeholder to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new forest supplier
In recent years Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the collaboration is at a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwest Switzerland" of Friday.
The Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packed forestry tables are distributed to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Nordwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughters achieve an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a scotch manufacturer.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Switzerland producers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey is trying to renew the Treaty beyond spring 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are addicted with delights from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class naked passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi distributes Chocolate Frey on the short route, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light athletics - Discus-Olympician Robert Harting reached WM-Finale
The three-fold world champion fights for a medal on Saturday at the final.
His brother Christoph, Olympian of 2016, failed in the national WM excretion and was able to look at the discus competition only from the Tribüne.
Similarly, with the first attempt, the Polish title defendant Piotr Malachowski, who was thrown 65,13 meters away, qualified for the end fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the neck
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 90s-greunge age (as the predenkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch Comedy for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parody and a figurative of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the Gag - actors of mid-aged age play good children who grow up - they nevertheless succeeded in winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten years later", with his adults, who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the Gießkannprincipe, including a reef to the Stalker films of the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Snakes the Way").
On one point a character stood by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there is another crazy-evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-established impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It's especially fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillon's "Singles" lipbar, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of coincidence that can warm this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds us of another type of nostalgia: the resurrection of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-and-west Ringkampf iconography.
The comodie created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 80s with the two policemen as friends, two officers of Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-sooked Gregor and an idealist iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so engaged in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask - that it often plays as a single one.
In six long episodes, it moves, and the comodie is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited at a lesser length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, since Gregor and Iosef visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who consume a lot of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a position.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with its own.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed a battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest Bar Circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as state prosecutors informed Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already adopted arrest orders against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in the case of contemporary racism in Italy.
There were German arrest orders against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian detectives were involved in the action.
Over 300 policemen were in operation.
The members of Mafia are confronted with organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the state prosecutor has established Constanz against the organised drug trade in the southern German area.
Between the state prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the detectives of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicilia.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo were also accompanied.
In view of the investigations, Italian nationals in particular moved with close reference to Italian mafia.
Also an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, where several shots were fired into a guest place early in the morning, is expected to go to the account of the bands.
How it regrets great gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious failures in asylum procedures.
The representative of the Federal Government's refugee management, Frank-Jürgen Method, has, according to a media report, made attention to large gaps in the foreign central register.
In the case of asylum procedures and discharges, deficiencies in the data recorded there could result in "partly serious deficiencies", warned in an analysis of the "Southdeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data have not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good to date.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found "of people who have long gone alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register".
"Erroneous data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," says the report further.
In the statistics on outgoing people, EU citizens are also included, which do not have to go out at all.
Such false associations, however, led "to a distorted debate on dealing with the dependants," says the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government seems to have started sending refugee families with less than 16-year-old children back to Italy when they are in there.
This is seen from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper says that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "with respect to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically not possible, so the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, it is responsible for refugees in the EU State which they first reach.
If a migrant moves to another EU country, it can return to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of reception for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has issued guarantees for the collection and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (ECMR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also return refugees there under the Dublin Agreement.
The intergovernmental speaker of the Left Group on the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Familys with children are threatening because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system human rights-unlawful conditions and a danger of child welfare."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All ahead Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality in the meeting of the municipality deserves the multi-fold willingness to give blood.
"It's genius how our body is designed for it, and we owe respect to the donors who offer their blood to strangers, still inappropriate," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conserves are divided into their components.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in spring.
"In this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circuit leader.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before this, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Omberer included the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Cousin spent ten times every 500 milliliter of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the reduction of inflation have slowed down the speculation of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "contracts" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's political decision-makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members trying to increase this month, since the weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, while inflation is expected to rise to nearly 3 % in the fall.
However, she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to reduce the inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that the credit costs might have to increase more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut economic package, which was released a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide more cheap funding for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (BIP) remains short-term weak, since pressure on the real income of households continues to stress consumption."
In terms of interest rates, she repeated that "a certain punishment of monetary policy" would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a "a little greater" scale than the markets are expected.
Markets are currently prognosising the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "decisive" and "restricted".
The Bank’s downward growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pounds fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pounds fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth rates have reduced the rising expectations for an increase in interest and GDP has increased to 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low wage increases, as the worsening is getting worse first before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy in the next few years can't 'prevent' income breakdown, but she added that the wages will be 'definite' at the end of their three-year pronunciation.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, resulting from the weak pounds, which will compensate for part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of the interest rates to 0.25% in August, after the shocking EU vote caused the reduction of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's final judgment on interest rates, the reputation of an increase in interest rates had increased, since inflation increased pressure on hard-tranged households and three political decision-makers demanded a rise of 0.5% in July.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and that it will be re-attracted in the next few months.
The Bank said that the surplus in relation to its target of 2 % is "all" to be attributed to the weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of the swap rates, the hypothesis market is expected to become more competitive, since the creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with the expiry of existing deals and conclude the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates become more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS access to "transformative" HIV preference treatment.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposition pre-exposure prophylax (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by approximately 86 percent, is now provided by healthcare services over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the appeal court confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first ones that will enable people to sign up, and further clinics will be followed in October before it will be introduced to whole England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV medicinal products taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious risks.
To take PrEP before sex means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sex.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also sign up for possible participation in their local sexual hospital.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver medicines this week after an internationally competitive purchase.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is targeted used, recorded and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is aimed at needy and dangerous people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of Terrence Higgins' Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister for Shadow Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after monthly delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changed infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to reach a step closer to the end of the distribution of HIV in society.
The great life: Intermediate and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earl's Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earl Court Apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of a elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me at Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceiling.
I loved her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overridden.
Originally a one-room property with a shaken layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne to add a living room and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceiling, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceiling and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the standard.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to blow.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down the glamourous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting sets the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all bests and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapseable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-enforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to glitter."
Thanks to the clever use of space and vacuum, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"On the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate maker will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the soil and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide its luxurious advantage to the room.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't in love with the electric boxes in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute because of one of Victoria’s largest real estate realms at a value of over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business capabilities should be divided.
Since 2014 Paul wanted to withdraw from the family operation, but a thorough distinction about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 property in value of more than a half billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburb.
After an agreement with her dead father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the corporate property and Paul about one third.
A legal act states that this means that Colin owns property at the value of $316 million and Paul at the value of $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failures.
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he proposes Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicates from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first Jean shops of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share her property with their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very refusaled, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and drag our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and me to end in our current struggle," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Staff Chief plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Staff Chief of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Stab Manager of the White House, met his first day of work with leaders, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to temp Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from bodies that were to be convinced," said former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February to politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep control of the Trumps Twitter habit, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets had contained more fuel without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff have managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one could consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
In May, politico - all concerned with this story - reported the preference of the consultants to give the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can respond to negative press sections, especially those with damageful leaks, and that he knows where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president of Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chikanes or that he had not offered any concrete evidence or that he had in the past made false charges and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then the Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tought to implement a system to manage and document the paper crap, which receives the Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective manager than prize, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Get Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people will be asked and hoped to help them.
Police across Europe sends this summer (virtual) post cards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the searched criminals are not naturally known, people are hoped and asked for indications.
Europol reported on Friday the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times have been viewed.
36 of the online searches have been captured so far, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to 'millionary' series
Some of the richest houseowners of the West Midlands are again standing on the foot of war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a grave drawn from the municipality to demand a field in front of their master houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "millionary series".
They brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being scared by a grave buried by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense plants and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained disabled to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have pressed Solihull's Council, who said it was "needless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones to the passengers.
The Council must be forced to implement because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved and are now back.
More arrived yesterday evening, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be mentioned said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many inhabitants as possible report a anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case."
Birkenhof becomes forest hotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the forest hotel Luise becomes.
The house is currently renovated before the gates of the pleasure city and is intended to be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the close of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues by the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Land Council in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came into the district, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum candidates by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not controversial in the municipality at that time.
But most of all, the chief mayor of the pleasure city, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious stakeholders at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with manager Birgit Scherer with a seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category named Forest Hotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the pleasant city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now forest hotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be made clear.
The floors were scraped out, ceiling partly, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single building site.
By March there is still a lot to do.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large showers, the entrance area is rearranged, new windows are built.
Everything was to be "beautiful bourgeois" later, as Thomas Scherer said.
"We want to make a jewel out there."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
You do not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated Innerstadt-Niveau, Scherer.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidays, groups or businessmen should feel well at the hotel.
Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he has already led, so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself exactly.
Nearly a million euros, he counts.
The outdoor plants are also being brought on frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In an interior courtyard a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia's affair: US Special Investigator sets in Grand Jury
In the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump, special detective Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The body has taken the job over the past weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" on the subject of calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there are already first invitations from the board in connection with a meeting between the oldest son of Trumps and a Russian lawyer.
US Secret Services have been accusing the Kreml for a long time to have intervened targetedly in the 2016 Presidency campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's campaigner and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations should be on several men who acted as the Republican's advisor in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps in private and business environments under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special detective drew Trump to the centre personally and examined the accusation that the President might have disabled justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible crime cases and to decide whether to accuse.
Grand jurys are therefore also called charge chambers.
Mostly they are activated in major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board can also be employed by the public prosecutors in order to invite persons to be heard under an oath.
According to the transmitter CNN, preliminary invitations were already issued, turning around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons participating in the meeting had been invited to make a statement, said the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps' consultant and cousin Jared Kushner and his then-time champion Paul Manafort were in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US TV that the establishment shows that Mueller is not being scared in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the accusation.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations is a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new disclosures, the President used a talk in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian history is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives democratics the opportunity to "feel well because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
However, this work usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI CEO James Comey said three times that the president wouldn't be detected.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed on it, it continued in the statement.
But Mueller had not been used until Trump Comey was fired.
As a result of this disfellowshipping, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstacle justice.
Comey said before a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special detective and his employees.
The result of speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
In contrast to an independent special detective of the convention, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on urgencies of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republic and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday that the special detectives could not be released so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg operates in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin from the shelfeis.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research informed this on Wednesday.
The over a billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of Kolossai now drives north and will probably take two or three years until it has been melted.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not take place from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after researching.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice shells in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to the heating of the earth.
The now broken colossal has been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Beef swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
So it grows constantly into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this shake was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breakdowns a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that there was a complete shawl.
There are some things to say that the Larsen-C-schelfeis is also in danger, because the front side has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may fall down if a piece is interrupted at a key point.
The melting of shake and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and ice presses as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the scalp causes the glaciers to mouth directly into the sea and to flow far faster than before.
This may increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-schelfeis is, according to AWI data, with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth largest shave of Antarctica.
At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front side to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"While it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of records," he also confirmed.
Controversy among scientists is whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last decades.
Although these researchers do not reflect the breakdown of this giant iceberg on climate change, many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen down over the past decades.
This long peak of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the island of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and is one of the most rapidly rising areas.
CDU wants home tariff at person
Since it becomes more difficult to occupie freely growing jobs, the CDU calls on the employer association to get more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day has turned through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now, again, 17 trainers have their first working day behind them.
The teaching offices in the circle seem to be very desired.
Approximately 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circuit lacks further staff in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
There are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann circle.
There are searches for doctors and engineers, as well as the forces of general administration.
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the circuit day and to counteract the lack of expertise in the administration.
The management is intended to "develop a concept of personal gain and personal development" in accordance with the requests of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract futurely the lack of candidates, says it.
The overall approach should focus on internal and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-cutting and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that were not known before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a regular "competition of public employers".
This includes a high number of employees who are dismissing from the service by sickness or age.
Thus, the maximum time to act so that no more jobs are unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter peoples, Head of the CDU Group, continues to go beyond the common request with his party.
He recently provided a thick surprise on the circuit day when he questioned the personal cost coverage publicly, and the other parties were surprised.
People want to be reviewed all the possibilities that allow for a withdrawal from the local employer association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the circuit management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circuit cities - should seek a household tariff," said people.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff regulation.
The wages are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circuit have grown increasingly over the past few years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostituated Protection Law.
Not least due to the rising number of asylum candidates, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and circuit director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy reinforces the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had enrolled a boat of the German Young Redding Association because their crew had effectively cooperated with human merchants in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The auxiliary organisation, which has been in operation for only one year, refused to express itself on detailed accusations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us is and remains the salvation of human life our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have monitored the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes snake boat migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human merchants, and that the smugglers can ride so that the ships can be used again.
At least one of these meetings was claimed to be only 1.3 miles from the Libya coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to overlook the authority of the Italian coastal guard, rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Behaviour, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared themselves willing to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Thursday said that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with themselves "a substantial changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize Organization physicians without borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescue measures has declined significantly over the past few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libya coastal guard and cooperation with local mayors have brought fruit.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Tsjad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in the North Palz in order to enjoy trials and attractions for four days.
Three friends were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley was a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michael Kapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, of which you could look far above the pfalzer forest and the forged levels.
Meanwhile, there were increasing increases for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day, we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Folkfest Wurst Market.
Once again, the viewpoint reached the viewpoint, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, a lot of height meters were again charged.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikes breathed in the free air inhalatory sole.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 hill meters, the group had seen the pfalzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is prepared for e-sport
Are the sport stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium grasses?
Fact is: E-Sport has long been a serious sector, become a lucrative business - large stars, million fans and huge tournaments with high gagen inclusive.
This has also been recognized by the first Federal Leagues who are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, who started an e-port department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA computer game 17 under contract.
"We hope thereby to enthusiasm the VfB's new young target groups," says Jochen Rotgermann.
He's sure "that still rises on this train a number of associations."
On the next weekend the FIFA World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the players of various clubs join each other.
For example, along with Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises a agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must be discussed especially with the 14-30-year-olds that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian.
With prominent e-porters under contract, you could be much more present online on these markets than to send the Federal League to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrege" or just the FIFA football simulation are being fought at competition level.
Longestly, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals come against each other.
And in the 2022 Asia games, e-sports are already part of the official program.
But is it at all a real sport?
For many, the idea is surely needed to be used.
Ingo Frobuse has also been discussing the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response ability.
Professional Gamer should train not only at the console, but also their body and take care of food.
"The fitted player is a good player."
Frobose also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic."
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.
Positively, scientists highlight the high integrational effect of the e-port.
The players are going internationally, this is like a large global family, since there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of the company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
That is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Soccer League.
However, the e-port is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further.
Large markets are Asia and the United States where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-wetter Unicrn.
Some things are also doing in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a teacher, says Frobose.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football Firstliga Associations are now obliged to set up an E-sport department, according to Dutt.
"In European comparison Germany is behind," explains the VfB Board of Directors for Rottermann.
Only falling in nostalgia and explaining old times is no longer enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time orienting the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"There can't be said that only at football everything remains as it was always."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
From the scandal of poisoned eggs are now affected by almost all states.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and taken all eggs out of sale across Germany.
Only eggs that are proven to contain no fipronil are intended to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind grids and five years were suspended.
Carter was convicted in June for the suspicion of Conrad Roy, who killed himself on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untrustful.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling.
She had been confronted with a 20-year maximum penalty, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a psychic disease.
In red pants and a cream-coloured flower, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She didn't repent."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "frightful situation that she's completely regreting."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that her age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant influence on their actions.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there's no day I'm not sorry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will wear with us for everlasting time," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she'd be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be aunt for his children.
"Not more to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case draws national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Shang up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder to her British fellow inhabitant in Italy before she was released two years ago, was among the few who defended Carter.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lamb of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup best in a large season - Extra-Motivation does not harm there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional clothing was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and neither Manuel Newer to see, he made the tie assigned to him hold on his arm.
"The trainer has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup winner after his first use as Bayern Capitän.
Well, the warrant could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could interpret Kimmich as well.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been elected in the professional C-Elf who had just come from the vacation as the leader, but he.
Sugar is the most favourable thing to distribute to those to whom you trust much that you want to keep quiet.
So whoever has been selected to enter into the heritage of lame can only use a small extra-motion.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old as a mini lamb flipped over the field.
Right behind, this is now his position, the white tie on her arm did the other.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this initial formation like the one who can best take the rod into the hand.
He gave instructions, tried to lead the unincorporated troop.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (had hardly worked); Renato Sanches by connecting to the Devil to the performances of the Asia travel (also only worked conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not notice negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Triot.
It worked very well anyway.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before defense, both acted sovereign.
The namously occupied Napoli Storm was often difficult, and the sile also tried to succeed some times in the game construction.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped that".
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new access, they saw after the party.
For example, Rudy gave not one or two in the catacombs, but sets out six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few knocky statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard of Süle a interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
Anyway, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated ÖFB-Damen
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported himself about Twitter shortly before the game and wishes the ÖFB lady everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is also a quasi club colleague of ÖFB Capitän Schnaderbeck and feebered with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champion-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bayern Dusel might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often inconsistent when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs is in the office of Volker Wissing (FDP).
Chambers and companies from the region speak on TV request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time condemn the old minister.
Frank Natu, chairman of the Trierer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes on the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all."
The largest turning looks at Natus in infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a plan-finding process, and the construction right is to stand until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the western circumstance of Trier, which is in the urgency of the Federal Road Road Plan.
The aim is to operate the route in December 2020, says Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide to support regional but international competitors.
The Industrial and Commerce Chamber (IHK) Trier, as Wissing suggested, seeks a Rheinland-Pfalz label at wine to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been defeated for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the IHK praises.
The crafts chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainers in the new Master Bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 is provided for the master review and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of master training.
The home job list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be made quickly, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, the main business manager of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing mobility at national operations are only 29 jobs occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to external offices.
CDU-Fractionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in the acquisition of country roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the lack of professionals in the region.
In addition, the wideband development in the country has been devastating.
In 2016, regional companies had only evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months because of inconsistencies.
Audi is intended to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there is more intelligent options than driving limitations" and thus refers to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is resident - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles would be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emitte diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for automobile manufacturers, installing installations for neutralisation of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of refusing the powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagens, which were able to regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices, to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but return in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagens, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagens after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to avoid emissions in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to stress Volkswagens: The luxury car manufacturer contributes overproportionally to the profit of Volkswagens.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Izar visitors, on the morning Saturday a fleet runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it moves to the Isar again on Saturday, he will see a great river between the flour and the river of Reichenbach.
And this is not a usual fleet, with Isar tourists.
The construction reference wants to clarify.
On the fleet you can see a great information transparency.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start to a public campaign to appeal to the Izar visitors.
With the motto "Where Love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow is intended to sharpen.
As last summer, the river went over the Isar and this year, there are further actions and measures to achieve a sensible and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos kneeling and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon drawings, the knobs of his figures are his brand.
At 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years of his artistship, he struck himself through, among other things, as a signator for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded in the end of the 1960s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stars" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artist of cities is inspired.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures are in drawings with the sleeve tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red place in Moscow.
On the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits on the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for gross and small, T-shirts, pleasants and watches, his wonderful figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a drawing movie and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-fisher as a counterplayer.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The turnbook is not written by him.
That is why he puts more on the TV series that, like his original drawings, is produced without word.
Lavendel from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in Southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is declined due to the conditions of dryness and insects transmitting from diseases, which creates great headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM Agriculture Research Institute in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This affects the life of Lavendel.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacteria that transfers dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavendel oil attracts not only for holidays, it is also very demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts of etheric oil."
The solutions considered include a better water distribution and the slowing down of the soil dilution, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thüring Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creamers, tongues, merchants, vagants, or a country servant camp are supposed to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The workforces of the Riodoce newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, alliance.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, sufficient perceptions and feelings of the abdomen.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cartel salary list, a catalogue of criminals that risk the chaos of Mexico.
There is no rest break of violence, and while the bodies are raising throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states in this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal lawyer was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crimes each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put before court.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrustful and although the terrain is more traitful now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve rivers".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
The rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But about Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-stage Mouseoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
For one minute forget that there is a state of "susence" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
Yet, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was an interview published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have irritated the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspapers.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporter loved to publish hard-taking investigations without fear of censur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
He said in a interview with Rompeviento TV last October, "is a way of life" in Sinaloa.
"You have to take over the task that will happen to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could flee like a port worker, the friend who was generous with embracing and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table there.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death also forced her to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and keep them alive.
"You don't like it if you are working with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start-up and landing tracks" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high measure of self-censorship and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The problem is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "A sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as are in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic mix of lucrative smugglery routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where Riodoce's employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-stage building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself declared untrustable.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on the government expenditure focused on the home city of the governor.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governmenting Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this site, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months before the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body statue.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was reverted to the storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Over the country, journalists have become more loud by writing down on roads and buildings in organized protests "SOS Press".
On this day, director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and to let them kill because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked that she be re-distributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has injured her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "concerned" by organised crimes, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with the organised crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have a terrifying effect.
No one forgets the death of the Blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas Cardell: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a guide article on the cover with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already completed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizen step in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum.
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued escalating, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the table, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen cryed up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just conclude," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used tarnation to avoid their enemies
At first view, it looks like a statue, even a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible noshorn of a Canadian mineworker have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they even found that his scarce skin was from red brown - and they said she had something of a "wrecky past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best panzed dinosaurs who have ever been found, and one of the world's best dinosaur copies".
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the creating time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has been impressed by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the plantefresser is the best-preserved fossil of its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grubed on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock on the place, and decided to look closer.
Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of the heavy plot of the earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best-reserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found out that this plant freezer, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The strongly panted dinosaur used a red and white decoration to hide from robbers, and used a protective technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to be better mixed into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, says experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurian family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shrubs and armours over his body.
They discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal empire, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although continuous estimates are common, the results are surprising as the size of borealopelta far exceeds the size of today’s live animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by meat-eating dinosaurs of sufficient pressure, that evolution promoted the deterioration of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals who use the contemporary estimation - think of rehe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and harmfuler than prey, which signals that this nodosaurer was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Starke robbery behaviour on a massive, strongly panted dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur robbers of the creed time must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for indications of his life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, came into a river and was driven out into the sea where he fell on his back to the sea ground.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conservative skin but also maintained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early creeping time.
You don't need to use much fantasy to reconstruct it. If you just slide a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The crying time was a time when huge theropods, meat- eating dinosaurs, stood on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the paniced dinosaur was chased by some of his fearful ancestors.
This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mumpified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best panzed dinosaur in the world, including skin and rust, and is complete from the nose to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long peaks that roared from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the panzed plant freezer was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater landscape preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fortified remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as ' rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confused it becomes.
Stoned residues of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are sprayed up.
I can count the shoes on his sohle.
In the lighter: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, mile - long stash and gaffers.
At the Stuttgart Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people have been injured at the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage.
According to the first information by the police, at 17.00 a.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg Country) connectors were at least 30 vehicles, including probable trucks, together.
The exact number of injured persons was not reported at first.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A great deal of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.
In the direction of München, a ten kilometers long backstage was created.
As a AZ reporter reports, there was massive disabilities on the counter-road - by numerous gaffers.
The fire force noted the marks of the vehicle lencers, which now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8 this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue hub screw was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's ever experienced: nothing unusual is that you're sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Come and wake up you insane or rip the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruption will soon be over.
The German railway is currently testing the unaffected driving card control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devaluate the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we'll expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of the next year on many other distance routes in Germany," said a rail speaker.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the driving card devaluation without schafner.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers do.
It must also be bought via the app of the railway which DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call up his ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train accompanyers receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train accompanyer comes to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already declared online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which, in turn, should be used by the passengers.
"Who wants to relax without ticket control through our train accompanying staff, simply checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This allows passengers to design their travel time in the train more personally," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Secondly, "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs".
Those who often drive railways know that alongside delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because you often have, in any case, one of your companions, not all the documents you need to deevaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staff card is missing or a document you need to show.
The result is endless discussions between train accompanyers and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and take the creator the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that's only on the ICE 915 connections Dortmund- Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart dinners.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She was stumbling over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said there.
As nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retreated on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to kill the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to two live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who had a shield with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bully dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman declared his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you all animals."
"This isn't usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've used to and we can typically call it."
At this moment I felt frozen.
I was angry and crying."
She bought a return and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the movies from 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, consisting of people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had a number of times before this morning “on the black experience and the black condition”.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activity and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to deliver ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience explicit racism, she is not different from the next black women's child.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-attack of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped transmit them to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activity for Ferrell began to be adopted.
"My activity has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food rights and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-regissors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came in mind, "Will you document or try to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fed by numerous cases of humans, often from white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-regisseur Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activity around death-tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other inhabitants, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us." Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because this is how I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it was not a Messianic leader in the movement, but a community that gathers together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open attendee of the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life how she is in love and marrying her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some injury in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black homosexual women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, characterized the film "Blacklife Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not a confirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who broke up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, homosexual woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the communication cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is at the expense for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
It describes the societal atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home, "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she climbs to a song and feels obliged to remember this since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Throom" to "Size Wong": TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it hasn't been built for a long time.
But since the first presentation in 2009, the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents.
It's cold. It's hard to leave the topic.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.
While one says to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really classy" (Nicole shows), comes from the other side: "Need no man" (Siggi betzen) or quite simply: "Lars Scholz!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build on a gallery to move more customers into the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then blow out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the land where the farm market hall is located in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be done.
The Gallery Machers want to integrate a market hall in the new building – to the Beda place with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying in the farm market hall for almost a week for many years.
Primarily our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwifes are always very happy.
We also discovered the Metzgery for ourselves.
We would wish that there is an opportunity to maintain this offer during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Ob direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the height of the rent.
But it should not be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Wozu shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I think that is excessive.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a ordinary weekly market here, it is so important that at least the market hall remains for us.
Because the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is priceworthy above.
As you see, store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, special businesses are almost no longer there and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Especially: Where is the farm market hall to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or it's the spook of bit-galery that's going to be able to drive all the stores from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And a shopping center that's empty does not need anybody.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg are no longer available.
When the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, almost unusual - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen Tuppers and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analytist banned a 35-year penalty after she made a secretly classified diplomatic report on WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition that was opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithm analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data might look, sharpened, although some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways to interpret them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but who has spoken openly about the identity of a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Spionage Law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a corn, black and white self, in which Manning apparently was sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platin-blooded perücke - which she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from Forensian artifacts such as cigarette stump and chew rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her prisoned museums became unequal letters friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would demand Mannings release only a few days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition now, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops, to find new, two-performed ways to further enflamme the stable divisions that he should actually remedy.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with its oversize signature under (the "i" in their family name is provided with a heart) demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basic sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand footer of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from it is that our intent does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
It shows Manning how she appears with a free-speak phone in the hand from the United States' disciplinary carcases, such as King-Kong.
"If they make your speech cold, they won," it says.
"Always never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I still get gins skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do so, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulators, which assembles like earrings of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 " 2, Mannings statur), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunting is going for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford, who is searched for as a suspect after a man had been buried with fatal injuries in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of their claimed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the documents of the Cook County Office.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several steps.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority declares that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives investigate the steps as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed to enter the Campus of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker of the university and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the US research authorities in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We will close the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian vice-premier Mutko
The Russian Vitaly Mutko vice-premier said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"In a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA driving plan was updated in this respect," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Road Plan to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-integration of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
"All things were announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping consultants must accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly promoted dopings in Russian sports.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has confessed a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report without precondition," said Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the Corporation of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-used.
Aldi does not sell eggs first
This was noted by the corporate groups.
It was a pure precautionary measure, and it could not continue to be deemed to have any health damage, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-release agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vain, little helpful or, even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistlebllowers allow the C-Suite leaders to be switched directly to the Management Board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows on a view which units have most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so that you can embrace why.
Companies come to realize that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture in order not to be the next Uber, which has been involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes a environment of harassment, in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish for a overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial-technical website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Falls in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies let customized "puls-" surveys send, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that can report bad behaviour with employees.
And if the main business manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that mistreats or acts unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer boykott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has spent Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centre.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company centre, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Well, as the company Convercent uses, problems previously hidden by leaders in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed faster.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employees more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke together for ethical infringements by the Enron Scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took the time that the "Social Media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with returning fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.
Glitters secured $10 million in November from Better Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are well running. Businesses run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics tools promise third party to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee involvement is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all, this can cultivate disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have too much relied on the collection of data.
"For if you don't follow employees ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And who do you not care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Rescue.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company by the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that, in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23 a.m. when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team at the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their graduations after the three-hour exercise before returning to Waterman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"This is for the boys the next three days a real tretmull," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday was Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times of play in Westwood practical exercises.
They are supposed to hold exercises during August 18. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA's regulation change, even if they add another point to the highly employed routes of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pressed it, they're sticking on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time, it'll really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear vision lines of its fields, will not be easy to take from a neighbouring parking area and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been hosted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gate patch.
Bruins players are supposed to occupie the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not much to think that people rent a room there and then set up there to record a exercise.
If you have the video tape from a exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact verification in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with error messages to fact reviewers of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible error messages and to send them to fact verifiers which may show the results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, of which many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French voters in front of the presidency elections were flooded with false stories in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new fact review was launched.
"Besides the knowledge of the stories of fact reviewers of third parties, people want to make more contextal decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce wrong messages.
Create a comic Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a lumphole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophair Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I like to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says painfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found in an unexpected emotional way.
"I have only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiners," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell for smoke, for at that time a fire was burned for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he would be there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overestimated my greeting") all of this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and bottles that spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the site and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who owned something: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a bearing to fight two families.
Guys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dip into the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rebellion of 1381.
"There is a record of an upset that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farmer resurrection began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century butterfly Arthur Darrell represented his own funeral by filling a box of stones (a discovery that was not made years later when his sarge was buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Favorite family of Scotney: "The men seemed to be pretty daunting, making guilts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise."
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has left a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-Roman on Elemenmaki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been demanded back from nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he said.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hidden
With the hiding of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new roofmark (sight of Thursday).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the Slogan secret.
At the end of August, there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action since yesterday asked on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (naturally!)," they write on their unlocked website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action it goes about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is true to make a single vow, one that gives the city an inconsistent unconsistent charter of university."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be cost the city of Bad Honnef its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Oberst Militärrat (YAS) consults on pensions and transportation in the officer corps.
This week too.
On the first look, a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish armies a year after the pussy attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five vice-presidents and the Ministers of Defence, Innerly, Justice and Foreign Affairs were now taking part in the discussions under the Presidency of the Head of Government.
The civilians in the YAS were in surplus.
The government is attracting the raids in the military.
Captain Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Marine were dismissed.
Since the failure of the coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army's series - mostly because of claimed connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Golden, which Erdogan sees as a wire dragger of the pudding attempt.
Against 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the pussy attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the putch, Erdogan had referred to the "Good gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the armies completely".
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Uncomfort in the military headquarters".
In the General Stack there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the abolition of the bann for soldiers, the newspaper.
Anyway, the great cleaning of the army and the security forces continue.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 officials fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan was counting the military.
The generals were previously deemed to be the real gentlemen of the country.
Three times they were called to put their role as guards of the worldly government order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step-by-step, not least under appeal to the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan targets the Islamization of the armies.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-named officer who was seeking for fear of persecution in abroad asylum, warned the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not leave the Nato cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after cleaning the willingness of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "swaped," says NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Convention.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the United States will spend green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to clean up track for racing ride hutle
Once again, in the past months, we have been fighting about the future of the racing shuttle - now it's supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the maroded route on which the tourist train is driving.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the racing shuttle, according to the Transport Ministry will start construction on the route this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and cleaning the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country confesses to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The costs for the restoration of the route were approximately 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The Treaty on which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future will currently be finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Tyren Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"In this way the driving plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years.
This was intended to be regularly ordered on December 2017.
The racing ride shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and the railroad.
During the past few months, pilot operations have been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also very constructive in parts.
The rise of sex roboters is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRC) published a report on the development of sex roboters in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of breastwarz and the type of fingernail.
"The people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get to see them even more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern sex pups have developed from their inspirable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by the artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color through the form of the breastwars to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex pups have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Friid Farrah" that convey the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventure" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as closely as possible adapted to your personality," the Web site of True Companion swears.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subject female qualities, the rape of rape, when one takes a step on Frigid (hit here: contradictive) Farrah, worried one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just keep another sex toys.
Their origin and their growing refinecies point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional grant.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes their rising popularity, they remain preliminaryly at the edge of consumer culture.
But what is swallowed from the border zones can be very educative with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these high-developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has screwed to have sexually attacked women.
The most horrifying aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Girl') is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the erected eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (also with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they are imitating the movement of a real body.
But, at the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no intermediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
Otherwise, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Girls
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney an inclusion of the healthy human mind
It has become a binsenity of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US elections have also divided families in small format.
About Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.
We all are supposed to work to get our filter bubbles placed.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With the Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family with which she had fought for decades of politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but in another context, I notice that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disgusting effect of his Presidency has the power to push us all right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the terrible possibility that his girls will not disturb us one day.
There is, however, an even more horrible long-term scenario in which the Trump Republican of the right wing "normalized" appears suddenly as an inclusion of reasonableness at once in comparison with his standards.
I think today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which both appeared as a very mild crime compared to Trump in fact.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify himself as an indispensable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the carusells of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are mourning and the animals are turning to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music presents this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I still haven't gone all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circuit traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience, as here two years, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carusell, I would have given him the full score, but, fortunately, no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a purchase house to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to synchronize the review with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to slowing down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the shopping house was laughing, while I was tired of the experience of reaching my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts, he was brought to the hospital of his wrists, which he had suffered to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal of the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed stone camp in the early mornings of Valentine's day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too careful.
The National Criminal Authority stated that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the four-classmen of Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the exhaust schools are going to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen on the evening of service.
The 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken court, but is then released to freedom.
This led the munter gentleman to a musical entitled "The eagle in the chicken court".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it grow out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making out of him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken fence in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles, the cylinders weared to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the boy is different from the other young animals (kikes), it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every four-classman to feel adopted in his new school.
It followed a thanksword to the colleagues, former school leader Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in at school paces, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of education, she is very unfortunate because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the four-class.
At the end, all students gave a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy with the children.
For the new school year, eight first-classes have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campsite in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally tented people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while a study is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have reinforced control over the free camping and placed substantial penalties on anyone found in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will be continued throughout the whole season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a penalty.
Software updates for Diesel vehicles: What the subjects now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for approximately 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of vehicles of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their re-enforcement has been organized by the KBA.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has notified to register any person concerned.
If anyway an inspection is obliged, it will be done in their framework.
How long would the re-equipment take place as a whole?
"That's hard to say," says Smethanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers are not voluntarily acting on the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The rehabilitation itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-taking to get a date.
What do drivers do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would withdraw, said smetanine.
Are you threatening a massive decline in price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas there is no value loss for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.
The first price grant under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizeholders doesn't want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center as the first rapper.
As the Cultural Facility announced on Thursday this year, the singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographers Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored ones.
The awards will be given in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organise a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania.
The progressive TV-series winner Lear has already announced that he should not participate in the Gala.
The New York Times, he said, "This Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to take away the funds - and that is a burden on me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her viewpoint.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former president John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
These are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worthwhile
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city master, will retire next year.
The body is already awarded - however, suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city master.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he shares in the press conversation.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the request profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
In this way, taking into account the regular notice periods, the time will still be enough for an interoperability.
Since Haslach operates as a sub-building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they couldn't fill these out anymore, the citizens would have to go to Openburg for advice.
But close to the city and to him, "Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have been gathered to look back on Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worthwhile," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But in the future, there are also varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen Park have been approximately encountered.
The Kinzig bridge between Ballenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium ancillary is still topic.
The last thing alone will be booked with approximately 1.5 million euros, "if we make it right," appreciates Wacker.
"All in all great tasks are waiting for my follower.
The work here is fun."
Designed are available for a city building master of large playspace.
Haslach's own building and gardening can be responded to many things quite flexible.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is a ensemble under monumental protection, it is important to have an eye for what fits in, when new buildings are approved, the divorced city master emphasizes.
In any event, the master of the city has a high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "in the end, everything goes over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-year-old employees: Markus Neumaier (Highbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Deep construction) has been in Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to conduct a complete study as a diplomat or a Bachelor specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning.
The city building office is subject to high- and low-depth construction, construction management, ground-winning affairs, administration of urban landscapes, urban farm with construction and urban gardening as well as undere construction law, including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railroad locked
According to the police, the hitherto unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transit in the area of the Leoben Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the nearby cargo had to be held.
The detectives go out of two male acts and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene had been observed by witnesses a rosary wheeler and a bicycle driver.
"It goes far beyond a lusbuben strain," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the transgressor would have put himself in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement, the railway customers could also have pönals on the deceaseds.
Overall, the speaker said that it was a "high" sum.
The damage was remedyed on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern railways could be carried without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had been lost Friday morning, two of them covered the telecommunications.
Goods trains did not fall, but they had a delay.
According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of the upper lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products may reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bleeding, returning or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the subjects are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, there can be an inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cells occur in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the protein building stones - to trip the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammable darms, if the same system also works in humans.
The post-doctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, which did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the darm microbioms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six bacteria types were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri made grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unmatched immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a biproduct of the triptophane metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the triptophane values were semi-halfed, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our stomach-darm talks.
It is not known whether triptophane adjuvants from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to triptophane have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the interior surface of the intestine.
Potential may lead to high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes that after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last fore-season game, before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formally arose.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' Preparation Tournee and only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadion when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priorities of new commitments.
"To get three from four, I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have made great efforts."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner to heaven.
The pilots fled from Seattle in Washington, U.S. State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved into the form of a Dreamliner over the United States, which are several thousand miles.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had already made such an advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in heaven.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, socialist Prime Ministers always looked for elections with some concern to Berlin.
Only no disturbance fires from the party centre, just no counter wind from the covenant - so was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD capitals.
What school has been given from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counter wind.
It was deep.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Niedersachsen, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows again: Red-Green simply cannot reliably rule," said CdU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising political emergence of a Green Delegation has led the government of Minister President Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-stood majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner has invited the descendant Lower Saxony Green Department Every Twesten to return their mandate.
Transition to CDU means a clear distortion of the chooser's will.
Each Twesten has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Manager and Champion of the Greens to the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," a SPD-whale fighter sucks when on Friday morning the new Job's message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, President-in-Office of the SPD of Niedersachsen, is here after the surrender of the Green Members Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own majority of governments.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crisiss in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Mise began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, rested the companions of the time.
After the country day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became too - and everything became significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite slaughtered the party smoothly.
The colleagues reappeared strangely in the weeks afterward.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him the next depth came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong head of the SPD country, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphil Harmony while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication afterwards, he made quite all the wrong thing you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and his role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxon Prime Minister has long been in criticism.
My survey values were added.
Yet, or perhaps that's why, because in the past weeks it was increasingly trying to put accents in the bond.
The attempt of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin also did not hide colleagues in the area of Martin Schulz.
They granted him because they promised because of a stabilisation of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because the interest of the Low Saxon Greens is in fact not a blame.
And Schulz hasn't been.
Sometimes the colleagues therefore strive to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath focuses on the Greens, and above all on the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerant and democratic harmful as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of Party Links in the SPD Friday Group, the RedaktionsNetwork Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not because of her personality as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Dutch Greens, so the Low Saxon Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Day Fraction, complains about an "unemocratic manöver".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: people made Stephan 'cause he was minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestagswahl, the RND.
"Now, the personal career of a future CDU delegate forfeits the election result," said Obermann.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funds for local core III
Anyone who wants to settle his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development informed about this on Wednesday in Receiving.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to what has happened.
Since 1991 there have been reception areas.
At that time, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the sum of funds.
In the remedial zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous repairs are a "success project" - it is eventually important to promote interior development and not only to establish new building areas.
On 4 April, the government Bureau Karlsruhe informed us that there will be a refurbishment area III.
The sum of funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country, the rest of the community received.
How does a refurbishment area emerge now?
You will, according to Schindler, examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in reconciling interests in the planned area.
If so, the territorial borders could also move again.
The steps represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the content of the Bundes-Länder-Programme "Social City", in which the sanctions would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of urban cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per property.
The remedial area would then be set as a statute.
The granting period for the funds has lasted until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
However, until September this year, the stock recording would only be carried out within the framework of the questionnaire to be completed by those involved in the rehabilitation area.
In November or December, the statute decision is to be taken as far as possible in order to start the rehabilitations in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating the urban deficiencies and deciding when and in what extent.
There will then be a remedial record in the basic book for each property.
Pietzschmann will come back to receipts and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project is the participation of stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be postally sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landing book", which includes the construction and reconstruction intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Haushalts- und Wohnungsbuch", information on size, division and residents of a living area can be made.
The blue "operative arc" shall be filled only if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a complete questionnaire is not a request for funds at the same time.
In addition, reconstruction measures are not supported.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds is working after the "Windhund principle" - who comes first, must first.
You couldn't "reserve" any funds for later.
To conclude, photos of the project "Local Corn II" were shown to make the present a reconstruction "smakful".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first one in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between thumb and point finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the lockers of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £300 per slot.
The married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the control.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the information of the military that was given to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Vice-President of the White House took a round through products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a firearm car from Wisconsin and a barbecue from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the evening of the event his commander, the deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 15 a.m. on July 17 a.m. at 7 a.m. for the event, and so long until the grass was cleaned between 18:00 and 21:00 a.m. this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours, a second crew would be required to return.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits Federal Employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could injure the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Looks like you're locked," the Deputy Commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Hatch Act.
But official events also have political toptones.
At the event, the President gave an incentive to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to impose the government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political benefits.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-OP, is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president's flight was carried out in Melbourne, Florida, in the background of his first campaign, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is excited by the show "Made In America" - showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Vice-Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to stop the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also fled 11 hours this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other receipts presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for president flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the hours tariffs of the US Defence Ministry for the financial year 2017, the doD refund rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Unit records the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the costs of taxpayers based on estimates of refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take account of the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, as most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked hard.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he joined his round over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and laughed with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a tight task
Top riders of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga join the table three Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel at the table three Searchsdorfer SV tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Despite the fact that five lots have remained unfair, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has gained the sense of reality.
In any case, team manager Marius Zay respects the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions, I think the crew is very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are primarily provided.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to actions in the Davis cup.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay with view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olees, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the current Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active French does not reach the Federalliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first use in this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was in the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Junioren World Range List in January 2016, someone from the trainer stack around Marius Zay fills up the frame.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really work happy when he put his signature under the law to reinforce sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his pace to adopt the law," the Congress packed up a few "constitutional regulations", he ate.
The Moscow reaction was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shone against the US precipitation.
In any case, the draft is intended to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
As a result, investors of the local OMV have since been concerned and co-financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian Eastern Sea Line North Stream 2.
The truck is huge.
However, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order.
Twelve weapons are for him to choose.
"The press" has looked at what the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staple 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is moved to the center in the heating of Netflix
Despite the second staircase of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is not over a long time.
The stacks three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third stack, the DEA focused on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali Cardel.
As mentioned by four powerful patents, they operate "as a fortune-500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returned as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian criminal prosecutors invited to support the war against drugs.
Further new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staircase of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city offers 46 kitchen services
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contacts for the children and a association to the team.
The clock is turned back to the town's children's day places.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the town's children's day facilities (Kitas) in its own state.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We all have been very happy."
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and provides freshly cooked refrigerated.
The city operates 46 children's day places in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunch.
In the past Kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the need grows steadily.
"In the meantime, eating not only children who are cared for 45 weeks at the Kita in the afternoon," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 14 o'clock."
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm the supplied foods, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-grouped as well as seven-group facilities - decides about the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now close to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more connected and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the Kita management."
For it is also about: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaningful.
Also for the children.
"You have a well-known power in the Kita, a person familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also shown the charm that it has shown as the most economically improved quality of kitchen services in comparison between self-equity and foreign award for the city, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-adjusted.
"But these hours in the educational area, about 750 people are not at all so much in weight," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the elections of the Council in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unlimitedly and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the Presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting actions to a advisory role.
This year, the elections will be handed over peacefully by a democraticly elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women registered from a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends at the Kolping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the killers tried to grab the phone and the necklace of the girl, but what was wrong.
Without prey, the Duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.

GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade unions want to verify the long-term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow with the managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has ignored the future of investments at the tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces other products of Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade unions representatives would "experience as first" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's head of the branch, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's "to point out that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB-Senior Organisator Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force focuses strongly on the local community and the large room of Glasgow, an important pillar for human employment in a area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic reduction in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a florating production presence in McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continual commitment with employees and trade unions representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, continuously review our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade unions will be the first to learn."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave behind in her persecution of Neymar after she has issued a offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than double the previous brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the previous season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive player and the world's highest-paid professional player. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced out his way, although a source near the Catalan Board is insisting that the club has always given its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the soccer world warned by the PSG president three years ago about this prospect?
When Manchester City in 2014 showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG media gamer Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Rolls thrown and damaged
On the night from Friday on Saturday, an unknown transgressor deliberately killed a roller in the Kingsfelder Straße before the property number 30 and thus caused sack damage of over 200 euros in the dressing of the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, ask for instructions.
For an accident on the B 215 between pride and reading, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his bike, the driver had to avoid a VW Touran and touched the lead board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW at 19,55 at B 215, was coming from Stolzenau to Reade.
In the area of the surroundings of Stolzenau, a truck met him on his bike, so he had to avoid the right.
The Touran driver touched the guide planke.
In the car car there were damages to matters.
The driver of the matching car, a Mercedes Benz, had overdrawn a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident damaged, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Doomspatzen report discharged Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses discharges Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
That's what writer and historian Michael Hesemann meant.
The final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the Reform Movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, expecting a excuse from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret of their own absences or their then false assessment of the transactions.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the reporting of violence in the courts was measured with "two dimensions".
Regarding the abuses in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and disgraceful" acts that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the "Grad Media Manipulation", says author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethical Committee.
"The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to think that is normal," writes Scaffia.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found eating."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beats had been a very normal educational means" "to get rid of frightened children, as I was one."
They find it unfair to apply today standards to previous decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger has often appeared.
Wrongly wrong, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he advocates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report presented by the Advocate Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Bistum Regensburg with the explanation?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzens were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 judges.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "So, in summary, it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychic violence in many cases.
The punishment for the punishment for the punishment could also be more severe in the case of high emotionality.
Yet, unlike many other accuseds, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with it despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal is discharged by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "exercise of violence to protect the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
Secondly, he also appears to be a cholicist and perfectionist, who became hand-handed by the opener when a domspatz musically did not bring a top performance.
How do you admire as his biograph this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make your efforts and read all the 440 pages of the report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.
He has just been dedicated eight pages and he is clearly released from any suspect of middle or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violent excesses at the preschool also occurred outside its functionality.
In any case, you can pretend to find out about it too late or have not taken first statements seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was found by practically all the respondents as - so literally - "release", "Heaven" and "better world".
In this way, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits a very excellent witness, describes him as "healthy", "favourable", "real", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely kind teachers, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and Bonbons and "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has led to angry outbreaks.
That he not only knocked with chairs and threw the key ring on the ground, but also distributed earfigs and pulled too lousy boys on the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted, deeply regretted and apologized.
However, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you remember such discipline methods?
Of course, I think each of us who were born before 1968.
I have also experienced this at a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report really concerns, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in the preschool, it is obviously bagatels.
So you wonder if it is not more about his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI. that many media just crashed on him.
Many who have never understood it still work hard on the Bavarian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report deprives Georg Ratzinger in all respects!
In the media, much was reported in the context of the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also charged with any development or co-science in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to have confided themselves to the domkapell champion.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem in examining sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, it would certainly not be a cholesterol, which, in some way, would have been a colleague of the criminals.
How, then, do Domspatzen-Scholars evaluate Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A questioned student put it this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the individual transgressor.
I believe it ... also really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... bubes have opened more intricate or clearer or even more open than to their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... -unthinkable."
Thus, the report makes the very clear result: "The fact that students in the preliminary field and/or their environment were in charge of them could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation."
So as regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is to be free from every fellow scientist.
He cannot be discarded, not prevented or advertised.
That is why there is no reason to associate his good name with these violent crimes, as has happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "waltexessents" was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former domkapell champion Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of the reporting, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
Because there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the court patches, between sexual abuse and violence excesses and, once we say, other accusations.
The report also deals with events from the time since 1945, that is, from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a cholesterol of the courtpatches.
The entire terrible pedagogics, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were frequently shocked and maltreated and suffered disgustingly below, all occurred at the preschool in Nachzhausen and Pilenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he was only faced the boys when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most Witnesses emphasize, was the topic "preschool" tabu.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although discipline was already prevailing, there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even connected positive memories with him despite violence".
That's what remains the contemplation to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported about the conditions in the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and from the transactions at a school in which he wasn't working and responsible, (so the Witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the circumstances?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which is even reproduced by the report.
In that he pointed out to them, "that the punishment will continue to be practiced in the preschool."
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when penalties were long banned in Bayern.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons may have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit has really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bayern.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "false tricks of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was absurd, nor to what was breached in the preschool of contradictions and violence on innocent child seals, that is far beyond what was used at that time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad that it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to pull ears and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger have for the book "My brother of the Pope" in the conversations with you?
Did the subject of the punishment also come to speak?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedictt XVI., explains from his perspective, where the domspats played only a sideroll.
Yet, I don't hide anyway that he led a strict regime there.
But it must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding necessary discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural messengers of Europe and its musical tradition, who went to tournée twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and Bonbons alone, you do not make any big singers and every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through my work on the book and further, I have really learned very well about Georg Ratzinger and have experienced it as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believed and hearty people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could also suffer a flight.
I regularly get to see how many former judicial patches today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Thus, those who do not forgive him that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most of them today are grateful to him for his enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely, that may be - but he was also a loving respectful person to whom they still look up today and worship them.
And please, again clearly, all that is being thrown for him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have defeated this time for a long time.
But it's very unfair to make a man, just because he's prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a median sinbook.
There's the evil intent behind it, just too obvious.
For the report that has just been published is discharged.
Now, the claim would insist that a 93-year-old man who acquired great earnings and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps Germany would not even know the Regensburger Domspats would finally be able to leave in peace.
