Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures of Tehran in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also involve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's continuing settlement building and proposes Netanyahu a lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal acquired by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme, the relationship between the two has further deteriorated.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, Netanyahu held a controversial talk, which was partly considered a distortion against Obama.
The talk was not agreed to Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel that was at its time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat bitched voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was criterioned on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was, according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who was instructed at two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site, where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the devastating emergency call afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police caught him.
One day after the shooting at the university, students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the researchers at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were instructed in the social science and history department, whose teachers included 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a permit for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which the lamb had worked so hard for it would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb cannot answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police found Lamb's track later when he entered Mississippi from Arkansas again.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the rear courtyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the edge of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, with 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He served in the spring in education.
One of Lamb's long-old friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's worm at that time.
All girls melt there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and live in the Jackson Province of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were evidently some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein House, which bounded to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends had remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer year market three years ago.
Later, they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter is writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw lamb and Prentiss night in the night of September 5 the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a bad audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Simply a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, on Tuesday evening, some 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community attended a Christmas Light Memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the Mahnwake, while the university shore "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be reopened on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call Prentiss called his wife, but there is no evidence that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to set up 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country. In Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were still hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month will begin with an application talk and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox shouts about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it'll gradually be clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and I think I'm a simulated goose and a arms length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had Premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "inconsistent with the largest time travel movie ever played."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN CEO once again calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday a press conference that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France - at the front of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unresolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to burn him as a flop.
Others have lost him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper rings in surveys, it has not (now) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed that Donald Trump was leading in the two-digit field, and some began to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of the property moguls.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the republic nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain at this time, of which no one won only a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trumps' popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
Until mid-July, it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP chooser GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be angry if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the Establishment, would be the candidate, they would be "unsatisfied" or "aggregated".
A majority of the Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Irish tenders who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-elected state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scholarships, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who wins the best GOP nomination, after a CNN/ORC survey last week four out of ten says that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four of the ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP choosers did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Yet, a variety of GOP choices have shown that Trump's campaign is plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still strikes almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the divided field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump harvests the majority of support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would cross the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A few majority of Donald Trump fans say they've developed their opinions.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their voices.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the view.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but choosers who say that they have developed their opinions are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico two months ago in his championship peace, the immigration was in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expression of Trump decisive Hispano Americans will be kept away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new Monday ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems to be Donald Trump.
The frustration about the government climbs to new highest levels.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters is now disappeared, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday Survey by ABC/Post, they rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republics are frustrated by the Republicans at the convention, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "healtically angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive housing facilities are located here in the Hobooken Road - with view of the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reet roof house costs at an average of EUR 73.300.
"The offer of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter costs most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places, one appears to be the price of peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranklist of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in dizzy heights.
There are several tens of thousand euros not - per square meter, well noticed.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top.
Champions League: Bavaria Dream Start thanks to Müller and Goths
Two-fold door shooter in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran's.
A superior start of the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Piräus witch.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and goddess match (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth startup sequence in series is supposed to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third beginning.
Müller received good assistance from the Olympiakos Torwart Roberto at his 28th meeting in the Champions League to lead Bayern, who let one pass as a flank thought shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadion before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munks kept words.
They showed a concentrated and engaging idea without shineing.
Piräus had won his most recent six home games in the king class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund was also stumbled.
However, the Bayerns, in seven Europeancup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously responded, but often too unfair to their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by play shifting on the left outside Douglas Costa, which rarely went through against the former Braun Swine Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left torch.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos Storm Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct absorption, the Torwart Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayers used to raise her dominant game, Piräu's needle stick was able to put.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was trusted.
For example, when he lenched a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola defended a fourth chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Gothze, after muscular problems back in the frame, sat out first.
The WM hero only gave green light after graduation, said the sports manager Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else of it, this is already malicious."
Guardiola also decided against him at the time of his first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59.).
Goth came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters, Müller put another one on it.
Before the game, it had come to scraps in the stadium.
After a smaller group of shocked Bayern fans appeared to have provoked the attendants of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces took action and attacked the monkeys.
At least a Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it hurts not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that is a long-term Potsdamer study.
The good news: If the risk is abandoned, the risk will slow down quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is seen from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental failure are caries and inflammations of dental meat, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear that smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risks in a short time, however, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years until the danger decreases to the level of non-smokers again, first author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smoking, studie manager Heiner Boeing from DIFE explained: "Smoking reduces lifetime."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by dental loss, DIFE notified.
Previous investigations have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rheinufer on residues from the late antique
Repeatedly, at the right Rheinufer in Cologne, archaeological findings have been made.
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman German Museum's Skelette and rest of historic buildings have buried out, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all building projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always drawn up as an expert office for archaeological ground monument care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, archaeologists now became fine.
Text documents have already been known that, in the fourth century, a fortress and a church have existed in the eighth century, Trier explained.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young Woman of Goods Train
After a young woman is devastated at the rail station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the people to help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1:40 p.m., the woman crossed the lead from the railway station building on the end of the railroad and was captured by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
As a result of the recording of the train, it has carried the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated locally and brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
For the reason of the nightly crossing of the young woman, there is no knowledge for the detective officials.
The incident may have been observed by Witnesses or inhabitants have heard acoustic perceptions.
In question, residents or passengers from Linderner Railway, tile bakerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Road (L364).
An indication on the cause of the accident can be given on a free, switched hotline of the Federal Police on the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
The EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitrary arbitration system in order to decline the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.
The controversial private explanatory bodies for disputes between Groups and States are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system which in its functioning is much more consistent with traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," explained EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Schwedin intends to put the proposal as a European position of negotiation into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU States and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the USA and third countries in the same way.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object against judgments.
Until now, the parties concerned agreed on arbitrators, which had no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
For example, there could be cleared disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The investor-state procedural procedures (ISDS) demanded by large companies are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a type of parallel justice, by the companies to charge taxpayers, by lifting national laws or by enabling a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TIP organisations, such as Campact, stated that the EU Commission's proposals are inadequate.
It was particularly criticised that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as a major progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, prepared in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against restricting economic appeal by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, said it.
When the discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, we remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have taken place since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should already be set at the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be no longer durable.
Delicious People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Besides him, there is a flipchart on which the shy people's singers recorded the picturesque U.S. State Michigan with Filzstift.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens' lecture.
He tells us on various sites, which he always signs on the map, which reports his minusive and tenderly arranged songs.
Where they were created and what it looks like in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative wrongdoer.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" published in 2003, it appears smartly composed songs, which are very close to American people of late sixties, but can at any time run into great opulent.
It emerges the reputation that "Michigan" would be the first part of a broken series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in sequence.
However, already in 2004 and in Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returned to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") appears in 2005 a surrounded masterpiece.
Surrounding ideas and stylistic fitness.
The album rises into the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influenceful music media.
After excessively productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic shiftpieces.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrad but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
At the longest end of the smaller clubs, the stage shows are here to the colorful spectacle of Neon star bands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark kept Hamburger Mer!
He presents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although now nearly 2,000 guests are banned in their chairs, the much mature Stevens return to intimity and people.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear that the lecture is "opulent" and thereby you can throw away the "spot in the essence".
Only for a addition, Stevens thanks humblely, plays acousticly few older songs, and eventually deprives themselves under an applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debüt at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's Debüt is expected to be excited at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and for the first time join David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six suggested questions shortly after noon, where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour departments in the vicinity.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it will come after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymn at a Memorial on the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism by a number of Tory-MPs and is the focus of several covers stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the National Heart has drawn attention to himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had "standing in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heltom of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the National Heart, "independent" on his belief that the monarchy should be disappeared.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stabbing" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour would introduce changes to remove the entire idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith said that the Shadow Work and Pension Minister that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he was Tory Chef, who has been faced with the dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is too confronted, and that he is being abandoned both "suitability" and dispute with reversal and instead has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on abroad.
He also put the idea into the conversation that other colleagues sometimes take the word and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre" which is often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the under house and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it was a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': homeless youths trained to photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former road children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a commonly useful studio that instructs homeless youths how to take pictures of their surroundings and gain them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pounds rose jumping to data that indicate an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. Parallelly, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result without bonus in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest and has been estimated over the date of an increase in interest since 2009.
The pounds increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed up to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition offered by the Rivalen AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up to 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales numbers strike all expectations and also demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again indicates growth.
Shares of Glencore grew by 5% after the mining grey said he took $2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the Packaging and Paper Group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment of the company Rating on "sell".
JD Sports grew by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The chief of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing force will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could take the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lipish 21 years young, a henfling with over-sweet hair.
The guy with the platin-blown hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Better even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is turning through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
These include Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m. in the morning the poles sit on the cold stone plates form Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Beeber Building: Here you live in Idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much on the day as their mama Ewa earns half a year.
If any.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnastics."
"I'll fill her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's the kid?
Not the fans.
Neither beer itself.
He's got it anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the superbowl, he wasted three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And with every doll that looks like it and goes over the shop table, beeber is also thrown away.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're surprised at the window sheet.
More than 100 million people say he's spent this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that beeber is eventually in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does that.
Pegida-Plakat brings Libanesian to potato tone-idea
Potatoes or Danes?
It's going both - and that's in the potato fields that Oldenburger imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the word "Cartoffel instead of Daner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat have put together on a spit.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cartoffels instead of Danes", which he randomly had seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue in his shop has been rotated with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Libanesian Patent Office in Munich.
It has been protected there, according to the Authority's information, as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes of the spit do not want Alhay to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes better together," he finds.
The culinary consensus is also good for its customers.
Metcash starts soil stability campaign to combat Aldi attack
Metcash is trying to protect IGA branches from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
The food-gross dealer Metcash has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in front of a $700 million aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as on events as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborogh, distributing samples in IGA stores and selling shop owners the approved tickets for the South Australian football league to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of his defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment implements its annual investor strategy day.
It's a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia make nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash IGA networks in the East.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provinceal and IGA retailers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analytists like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first markets and will remove all existing actors, but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million turnover per year and metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and reach a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the quantity on Metcash's high fixed cost base, Metcash could cost about $13 million profits before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern States, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash’ turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, with 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will decrease the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash probably will disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt debt decline at the same time as the pressure on turnover and margins.
However, the wholesaler avoids and invests more than $150 million to improve sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's principal business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop fixing programmes will lay down to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always called "Special Ks", came into the disgusting dispute of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fire qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, where Harrison called: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgyos, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen knocking a tennis striker after a seizure of a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth, the second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup halffinale against Great Britain.
"One of the things I'm quite excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little into the struggle," said Healy.
He broke a stroke when he lost a seizure in the US-Open, but he is not the first player who broke a stroke of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has acted extremely well in the US-Open, even under the pretty provokative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He's got a great team around himself, he's got a great family around himself, and I think he's been treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is well in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged after his own earnings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm part to the team."
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very fast, which people like springs and Murray have pointed to. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's best for the crew and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains distress, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explained the distress and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. All in order to stop the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a none country and Serbian officials reacted with angryness.
For an unknown time, the people who fled from violence stood on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and were settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police hub screw over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and screamed insults against the Hungarian willingness police.
Some showed back from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be returned from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be conversations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulencies at the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived one day after the 28-National Block at a controversial meeting in Brussels, no common immigration policy could be agreed.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the surrounded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, in the end of the next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU States would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes for a quick action by Brussels or by its neighbours.
The emergency situation in two southern regions called on on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could lock up roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto said that his country also plans to build a stachel wire tune along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a gate at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the stachel wire tune between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a significant close passport for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damage to the 4-metre (13 feet) high cage that the government has built along the southern border to Serbia to a crime. These laws also establish higher penalties for condemned human merchants.
"Due to the situation arising from mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal cross-border transition is a crime.
Parliament must continue to agree procedureally to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Advisor for Orban, said that governments had reached 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come across by damaging the door, they are now in police preserved and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly.
The Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border transitions with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with stachel wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push into it.
Some 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's advance before Bernie Sanders halfed in national survey
The former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advance in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins you on the ground.
Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, 27 percent (17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the President's office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the start of the prevalences, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some profits.
Clinton holds a great precursor in women and moderates, but these principles have decreased.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is just back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has escaped, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, still has a great advance in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit predominance with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point predecessor with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections across the country say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporter is especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about one quarter would be enthusiastic to support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republic voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The consent to deal with the problems and the choice will also be quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the Presidential Office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, biding is at the top.
About Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far before Sanders.
When Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of democracies, Hillary Clinton's predominance before Sanders rises from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice, but this figure has decreased by 78 percent last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement with distance, but the percentage that views it as the most "choosable" has increased.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important to a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the choice.
Like last month, no one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electoral voters is unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features of the elections of their party.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management quality.
Being is best cutting off with the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe it.
In general, democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked as foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions by Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion was still worsening.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them among all registered voters: only 32 percent have seen them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the elected people across the country also view Trump as not honest and unreliable.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes in leadership.
By the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off in honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honestly, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes up in a country-wide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramaticly.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country. The support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was carried out before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the survey on Tuesday.
But in the same period, Carson shot from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson is well approached in demographic groups and that Trump is superior to republic voters with university education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on the third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons by Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - he lands 19% support to the Republicans, behind the trumpet with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
In view of a carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side heights for the former neuro surgeons, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even though top values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathing vacants to find warm water.
A bath in the North or East Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer in the sea: maximum 18 degrees of water in the North and East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In Adria it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes at 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood are burdened with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a squeaky ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, mortalities are submitted against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Bruderschaft attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officers said he was loaded with a 30-pounds backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headache, and then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi-Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became unauthorized and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, says the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police manager Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point the members began to hide outensils and in principle put the welfare of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said police manager Wagner.
He couldn't be resurrected, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stupid force injuries to the head, rump and upper thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the slices of the brotherhood. At least one student has died in the Schicans every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a complaint on the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Twenty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of squeaky attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that - officially or inofficially - sanctioned this, we will also take account of them," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the fat increases interest
An increase in interest, and the houses will be lost, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will go into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history offers only small guidance for the economy.
A recession came within 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial facilities respond.
Consequently, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the time when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, at the end, market participants might find that the entire excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is understood by some to be interpreted as a signal for the end of the "billy money" era," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low level to lead to the seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some sectors of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, pre-experiencement of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets will be deprecated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the rate increases of the Fed.
Exactly, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the rise - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six previous cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, Chef Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the event of an increase in the interest rate of the fat.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in a so fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question "whether this time is different," said the German Bank.
Market participants have been focused on an increase in the interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many streets and economists believe that the FOMC could authorise an increase in this session, the future trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all the increase cycles took place in a super cycle with increasing trends in GDP from 1950 to today, and very quickly post-recession heights have been placed in the shadow after the start of recreation," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market advances an increase in interest and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bonds are falling immediately, said the German Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse of yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fluctuation of the curve.
High interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yield," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analysis at Schwab in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent money policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed reinforces its strategy.
Overall, businesses who take the largest part of their business activities in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and increasing the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse because an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after a initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance have, after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, averagely exceeded 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality penalties by average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts are different in their opinion of how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for his "condemnation"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament-College Damien Collins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transmitter does not.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster should be "dummed" and is increasingly distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "condemn" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be only under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you are actually just imitating what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classic music nowhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really inexcessive.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, new music and commissioning new works, I also really think important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production, which occurred during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports for the purpose of entering the commercial rivalry.
The Tory delegate Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-wise".
He added, he wishes that the company "finds a hit from our own house steal" when it starts a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fees payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet turnover grew the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month, the lowest result has been since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November broke the expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been built, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are signs now that the online exchanges stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 by only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to shop with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now it's going to get into it, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the delay in turnover.
Experts believe that buyers will stop their purchases before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of purchasers went around their computers to make their clothes, and some traders websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which the buyers fighted for scratch, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than 1 £ was issued online from 5 £ expenditure.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now being carried out via web stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in Mekka at the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mekka through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays the burden on the collapse of some of the giant Saudi Bin-Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane of Mekka's great mosque crashed.
The sad ones filled, largely dressed in white, the route to bolster their respect when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Friedhof.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days before a crane of construction fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster, which also left 394 injured ones.
The bodies of 29 bears that were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Moschee of Mekka were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Moschee.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that Haddsch will continue to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
A Arab version of the decree published by the state of Saudi Press Agency stated that the bin-loading group was responsible for the crash.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crash of the crane, which fell into an inner courtyard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before Haddsch, which later occurs this month, gathered together.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the breakdown of the Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also accused the group for non-actual security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekka's big mosquee as part of the massive construction project led by the bin-load group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostasy son who was dismissed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) should be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employed craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 other screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales offices across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain puts their hampers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can be sent with a hammer or a brush to strike walls, you seem to be a minority today.
For Britain is increasingly employed craftsmen to carry out homeworking jobs in their homes, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, a new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction markets chain, said that a great increase in qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, providing services at low prices, is now overdue.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other screwfix shops that are addressed to craftsmen and to close 60 sales points of B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions in the shop are taken by women.
At the moment, the men weigh over with the employees.
She said that it was necessary to put up the growing demographic trends, which have more single female households that do more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important topic.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher indicated a decline in the half-year profit and sales after the group trained the costs of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob due to unfaithfulness in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vicemeister Aich/Dob had to be responsible for unfaithfulness and tax immigration.
The prosecutors did not confess.
One of them had also been accused of official abuse.
He was legally released from this contemplation in May.
The current process has been denied.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had crystalized that the accuseds used funds of contract accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006-2011.
The damage is counted by about 400,000 euros.
Sports operators are also accused of financial offences.
This fact was excreted by the chairman of the Shepherdsenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is intended to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to discharge the unfaithfulness, the defense stated that at no time the association had a disadvantage of assets.
Sports operators would only have dealt with wage damages and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested much time and money from the debts - the liabilities were around 600,000 shilling in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"Then we were in the face of the situation: do we continue to run the club or lock up the club?" said one of the accused, in the bread profession, major auditors of the financial office.
With his colleague and fellow complaints, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have shot money, put our life insurance as security to the bank," he said at the agreement.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, it must only not be made guilty.
Furthermore, in the event of a successful financial success, the payout of wages was retroactively decided by 1991.
Therefore, some of the efforts were only paid years later, from the year 2003, when a plus was on the account.
The former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accuseds together, said the second accused.
The judge asked why the payments were not detailedly revealed to the association.
The association was not interested in the financial arrangement in detail that only debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When a functionary investigation was initiated in 2011 for official abuse, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the United Kingdom account.
The accuseds declared that they had been defeated.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?", the judge wanted to know.
The questioner did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The complainant had been informed, the functionary justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "hazard recovery".
Why damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first prosecutor stated that he had not agreed with this statement because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of the cutter."
"Is I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functionary said that he never had a cent salary, he just lost kilometers of money and diet.
He took account of 1,000 euros per month to the association, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documentation for the early years could not provide the accused.
These were no longer stored after an operational test in which everything was considered correct, they explained.
The second accused had also been paid in mileage.
All repairs had been made in a bar, and he had to go from his residential place to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on September 23 with the hearing of Witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the degradation of staff for three years, the computer mass will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The postages of the U.S. computerry Hewlett Packard (HP) will not end.
The U.S. Technology Group plans to reduce from 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in its business customer party in the context of its restructuring.
In order to save costs of $2.7 billion (2.4 billion euros), the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of about $2.7 billion, which will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55.000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP was still employed about 302.000 employees.
Afterwards, the Hewlett Packard share abandoned 2.3 percent.
The group grown up with printers from the Californian Palo Alto is currently splitting up: so the computer and printing business is still to be bonded in a new society - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be recorded at the stock exchange.
A new disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand for its services were last added to the second largest PC manufacturer in the world to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sale of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent.
The turnover fell by 8 per cent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This led to a reduction in sales in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a breakdown and massive strokes on the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted lately to the fact that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and make more and more shops online.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the decline of about 5,000 places.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would mainly reject: 54 per cent opposed, 35 per cent agreed.
The fact that other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian power owner Bashar al-Assad refuses 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on 66. IAA
The centre of the fair is networked, self-running cars and electrical mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Car Exhibition under the motto "Mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association are expected as two years ago with some 900 000 visitors.
Roszke: Violent outbreak at Serbian Hungarian border
The Hungarian police set up at the Serbian border at Roszke's tear gas and water rays against several hundred refugees injured.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind this, a police line had been shaped and behind the police a water lamp was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, stocks and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn something.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered from breathlessness.
The Serbian police press speakers also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes when the US note bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time the interests are raised for almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists, who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half, which was still the opinion last week that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will persist a little longer and the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is an historical event because it has been seven years ago since the Fed interest was set to NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generates only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adapt to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 2 a.m.
Death Guard at Delta State University left an apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sorry" to him at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unseen," announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a teacher for geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 in Monday morning
He said he shot somebody and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police would have to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but "no one's going to disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor in history, before eventually took his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb claimed to believe that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday, there are "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who declared that they were married about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and she was "devastated on the ground".
He said Prentiss was her daughter "Absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He won't go to prison."
When policemen picked him up at the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to walk, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the University's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky bringers
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also claims to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted for drug possessions.
All of this certainly requires his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the group
The Lufthansa plans a large corporate construction.
A half a billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organisation.
150 of the world's about 1,000 leaders will cost the company's workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot trade unions.
The Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and reconsiders Eurowing's cheap daughter.
The aim of re-establishment is to contribute about EUR 500 million per year from cost and remuneration synergies, the airline informed us on Wednesday.
Among other things, the airhansa will no longer be the board for the passenger business.
The Eurowings cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Board of Directors for Chef Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the reconciliation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group is going to join Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the conflict of tariffs with the Cockpit (VC) pilot association, the negotiations will be re-opened after the judicial strike that Thursday.
That was what the trade unions informed.
The subject of discussions is to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to "in one year with a prognosised recording result" to achieve portable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between trade unions and Airline led to various strikes in the past months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, background is the saving concept "Wings".
It appears that in the fight against competition, the airhansa reserves routes to Eurowing's Group Billig Line.
Under the title "Morgenzug in die Süden" paintings of Leena Krüger can be seen in the artistic house.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League degradation of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defense to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The injury was caused by a reluctant attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
He had a oxygen mask in the cabin.
He wept.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red map and the hanging of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had mistaken.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were dropped.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to cure begins now, I come back stronger."
In relation to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
The Defense of England, with the European Championship in France, has an additional incentive to recover until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intent of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bonebreak when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's team at the 2014 WM.
"He makes himself very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you then hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult something can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Do you sure David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fabel published by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: " funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the action of the book, instead represents a description of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a good thing, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey to the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus's hostage and died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this was not suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here, a unnamed boy hears the local environment, like the monetary, trees falling, thneed striking once-lers, despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a cracking, snowing being, "what speaks in the name of the trees" is destroyed.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read the Lorax 20 times in conjunction with a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by excluding England's crew, but it's still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series degradation is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outside victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on test level, is an option for the attack.
Report related to this: Adam Lyth is separated from the England test chain and is replaced by Alex Hales.
Of course, the decision to leave Adam Lyth out is hard for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questionnaires with Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best choosers.
Long ago, Lyth's run had been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
If he's hoping to run out for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England trainer Trevor Bayliss commended his attitude, even if he did not make such good services, and that is not surprising to me; he is especially a team-man.
The question of how much time a test killer gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth received seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outside.
The only contemplation that can be raised was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales's coming in, and he's a struggle I appreciate.
He is a X-Factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
It must receive at least the same chances as those before it, but this depends, of course, on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beaten next to Cook, which would bring an extra-Spin-Bowler and receive four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a beatman can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may view their statistics - average 31 with the beatman and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made some smart supplements at the trainer staircase.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a championship.
He is one of the most nice guys of the game that will bring abundance of experiences, because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the cab, even if the news is in line with the previously spoken.
Colly team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Days, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teammakers do not determine the schedule.
And you need to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easy of the heart.
The Brexit warehouse (Brexit = UK exit) could win in turn if the economy is in a flavour until 2017
David Camerons' unprecedented new negotiation strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU will be deeper in trouble every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is devastated because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their corbyns and Nigel dangers.
A European diplomatfriend recently said that some Member States, as deeply as the EU is, are satisfied with different crisiss, and not always because of their own debt, Britain's own agenda, with split concessions and disturbing Treaty amendments, which they do not mostly want.
In Brighton, the TUC at its Annual Assembly decided that it would not like them even if they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climbing at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, making a photo of itself before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that she wins allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to look out in the UK inside the EU tent - "Don't let us go alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some main cities have come to the point where they care whether we stay or go.
Germany's carefully minded Chancellor Angela Merkel is a alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, how it has happened with the excessive long endurances such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a foolish force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain one left.
It's hard to imagine that they're gonna cut off a leg to help the self-breaks whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want because most of them have similar separatist trends.
Therefore, some such ministers may deliberately plan not even helpful comments, all in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The reconciliation was a plague" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the reconciliation."
The Europeans know how rubbish the Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU creators are the oligarchy of the press barone, as it was during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro opportunist, who made a name as a "EU Straight banana" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing shurks, phone-hackering foreigners and the Pseudo non-inhabitants who have most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but found that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming for lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum spine, because Blair had set the principle on the unauthorized EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need to waste time for me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It can take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I would like to express it kindly - is in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional lead-arbic trend and the wildr filtrations of Tory's small Englishism, I guess everyone can say yes.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Benn" Benn on radio and television this week when the pathfinder struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocating John McDonnell as a shadow canceller was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father in television tried to be disloyal to his labor-cabinett colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, but what JC told his colleagues and Members after all their reports at their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to communicate - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the societal media, a breast place of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe, which allows him to think labor support in the referendum campaign for self-understanding, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental multi-definitions of EU membership - in line with their associate camping economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidents for which the narcissm of the small difference is a key principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multi-precisions to Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not start a campaign for the exit - foreign diplomates will be obliged to try to find a sense for their managers at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, and they also have distrustful voters, to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the power of the Tory government, which I was reminded of when I started Monday, something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the report by Public Health England on E-Cigarettes
According to a state-financed agency, e- cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on cigarettes.
PHE published the "primary report" last month and describes it as a "complete review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "base on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that E cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to create a model for a multicriteria decision analysis (Multi-criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to develop their opinions on the damages of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose managers should have previously received from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funds from an e- cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding that he was supposed to have received in advance by the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not provided, but include several known e-cigarets champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The tobacco leadership of PHE also took part in the meeting.
The research work of the group "becomes significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there has been no evidence that E cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking" were prepared.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been reacted.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his abuse.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarets are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually of a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarets are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "will give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, probably seen by a smaller audience, in hardly controversial times against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will provide or send programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidiated rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee in the context of his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to hold the radio fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give your production to programmes that do not make or order others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach a widest possible support for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive taxing programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, of course both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was the fault of the hunting for evaluations "for the ambitions of people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed to sell the BBC shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law nisch programs should "go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their spectacular missions to justify £4 billion radio fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscured programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value from this.
Of course, all of you think, we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me if this is true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday, asked BBC to check their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain."
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should be an example for the public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to "inform, inform and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms of which he said that only one handful is displayed on television, and enter alliances with the commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction at the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The small nematods change the direction at the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by enabling Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Creekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electric impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Thread worms usually do not respond to ultrasonic, but Chalasani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves make the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoneurones are carrying TRP-4 ion channels.
When using ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblases and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a trackbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages to this technology.
Unlike light that must be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door!
The ads disgrace Britain's weapons trade
View Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen Video.
Horrible murderer drones!
Foot legs crushing legs!
The spread bomb!
And electro-scocking sticks that cause pain, but do not leave any trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images make no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapons fair is a fighter parodie produced by Amnesty International to make the British government's willingness to accelerate weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.
Family: DSEI Arms Messe: Authoritary regimes stream to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the fonts of the London Underground and the brand of the DLR line, which turns into the picture of a tank.
In September a sword of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are of artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for Horrible Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of inbus keys, which claims that "access to about one third of the bus stops advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parodie displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Doctor at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of gallery.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move out into the real world so that their art can influence society.
Another of the anti-waffn trade pactates greet the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works commonly with the graphics and Voiceover artists, who also works free of charge.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms fair - through an empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Give them the campaign that they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic business advertising, but "through flowering with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen our consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a entry from the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be handled illegally before our door door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are fantasticly euphemist products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a order of the US army on "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battle head, which delivers outstanding effects within the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Elf years ago, as a 19-year-old self-forgotten, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those I had angry - and the numerous long- breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distillated in eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes is enough from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to suck: people tell where you're coming from, whether and where you've taken a Sabbath year, where you stand about Corbyn and why you "honestly say you don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a hefe extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like, in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wimpers were fired and these fires were fired.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drink recipes, movie night events places and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress themselves and rectify their underwear.
In relation to this: Don't think of starting at the uni with a relationship
Introverted people receive a gross treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room cottage that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who trys to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave to get back the energy I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a Commilitone is exhausted of companionship - and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Apropos banking: do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the uni at the climax of the back manie, knocking at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have backed you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade decorations is a good way to close friendships.
Your inhabitants feel obliged to entertain themselves and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed chunks of flour, sugar and fat cause people to get sleepy when you knock.
Steeling food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing of chicken is a steal, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my fellow inhabitant who added her milk a dishwasher to punish thiefs.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that prevents people from sleeping or working.
It's not only about being a decent person, but that you are one of the people who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the proverb.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if they cared about making Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00, she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she let her own music play, closed her door and went to her three - hour trial.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student home?
Conversely, wouldn't it be embarrassing if you believe a fellow inhabitant for your future mate, contact her, divorce her again, and then see them every day, and perhaps experience how she moves all of her shared friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow inhabitant is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your substance a little sense.
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between a wolf and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments to become a bumerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson on safety by hiding - but never devour any room with dental pasta and shampoo.
Close their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't thank their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Sequency houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate owner Markus Gildner builds in the middle-frankish corner valley row houses for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need a living room, but also the nursing mother and the low-deservant."
"I show how to build well and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the apartment market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a cheap living room can be created: he builds a series house for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the apartment market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or turning halls has no sustainability.
Because people are staying here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need enough housing in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-stage row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different if you spend people in living blocks.
Each of the six houses just built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each four asylum candidates.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the relevant needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overlookable.
The construction took six months.
That's proper.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: Constructional law I correctly reviewed my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening damokles sword special construction and the altitude regulation.
It's horrible.
It is still understood that who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three places.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum candidates have no cars.
How have the inhabitants reacted to their range house project?
Gildner: There were those who cast me to create luxury buildings for asylum candidates.
What definitely is not true.
But don't you reinforce the competition for payable apartments?
Gildner: True is that we have had a building tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, the normal people also need living room.
Not only refugees but also the only parent or the low-deservant.
I show how to build well and well today.
That's what it is.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first went into environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "software update".
If ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installing, as they receive an error message that announces that the "software update failed".
To overcome the problem, users are recommended either to wait until the crash goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this unlikely by degrading the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them when the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger, so the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may deactivate halfway and this could result in an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only Devis: Fulle Attacke
Nico Rosberg knows only one second in the fight for the WM title in the formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attacke".
The WM second emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points distinguish the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday by title defender and two-fold Champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacks the flood light-ground-prix in the city state as a favorite.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
For days a dark watch has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chechclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has taken another member into his rows, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to the cure.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1. class and honored citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that took Alfred Klein, the chairman.
It is thus possible to record chess players who cannot pay the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent seeking will also be advanced.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Rot-White" should be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Quarters Office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Old Centrum Antonistift have joined under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new location at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to discussions, you can also take part in courses.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
Exactly at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the shopping market, receives immediately senior and consulting information on questions such as care insurance or benefits from the healthcare and care care providers.
For years, with our ambulant nursing service, we have found that often plowing family members are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Not often many benefits of the cash are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new houselord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken to the boat for this.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Center for Care and Care," explained Heike Riedel, director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre, both managers see particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the dedication celebrations, the quarter office also devotes itself to the assembly at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite them to a regular social assembly."
This makes a great contribution to the social foundation that seniors can live as self-employed as well as well as well in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 a.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 a.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m.
Entracht Bamberg v Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the FC Eintracht Bamberg game against the third-persons of Würzburger Kickers was not yet defined on the fuchs park stage, the 6th October was now set as a date.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighthfinale of the Bayerian football Totopokals against the third-person FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally terminated.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19:00 in the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hemmer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope that there will be many spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special excitement.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg 2010 entered by victory at the district ligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives EUR 5000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association Pokal 2016/2017.
Title defendant is third party departure SpVgg Unterhaching.
Death of Vienna architect Karl Mang 92 years
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, when he was 92 years old, as the artistic house informed on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcasting.
Mang was born in Vienna in 1922 during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he worked as a freely designed architect, but was also a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and to the rebuilding of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian theatre museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese hosts police with money
Ex-Football Tim Wiese has been noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national guardian in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hopenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added according to his own statement in the past two years.
He did not add intellectually.
Wiese was able to cut the hair just in the Bremer Inner City when he saw a parking space guard for his white Chevrolet Camaro exhibited a penalty certificate outside.
Wise then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the defeated penalty before her feet, as the "Picture" scene reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that, it will be decided whether grass is displayed, or not.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-type climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the growth of the marijuana plants.
For three days the authorities of Panama have scattered the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men struggle to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the groups, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends, according to the police, at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the BFT-Tankstelle.
Three persons also stayed on the site of the tank station.
One of these men now shouted to the young people and struck this with the fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeded strongly out of the nose.
When his two friends rushed around and talked considerably to the battler, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The transgressor followed the group with a car to their apartment and passed there several times demonstratingly.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured one went by the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the battler and another male person.
With the help of a strike, the victim’s face and upper thickness were beaten.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
To date, there is only a vacuum criminal description.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second battler was supposed to have been about 1,65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking Witnesses and providers to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also a pleasure for Samtgemeindeburger Meister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf has happiness: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen goes to retire, her husband Karl-Heinrich still stands his follower with a half job in the next few months.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October until then investing 310000 euros in the rooms at the St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the Felstehausen's years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who are currently graduating their medical training in the world hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had back in the head that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The Müller couple liked the idea to practice its own practice in Asendorf in future.
"The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Wilsen.
There, Frank Müller's double family father also grew up, his medical study in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently serving as a superphysician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as the leading emergency doctor in the District of Diepholz and is officially engaged in the DRC's prosperity of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to settle as home doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the EDV is fully renewed.
A total of EUR 50,000 will be granted to the Müllers in the framework of a support programme by the district (EUR 25000) as well as by the Samtgemeinde (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," stresses Samtgenburger Master Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gondoll, some 2,000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, in the North German average practice, there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another home doctoral practice.
A positive side effect of the acquisition by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains, according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found herself, she would have gone.
In addition, those who visit Müller's speaking hours continue to look in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smeltingly.
A little sorrow will feel them after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will probably see many patients still often," says the internist.
Your husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 quadrat meter base."
"Bisher, I always pushed myself before garden work, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple have two grandchildren and would like to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees pass"
"Now border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain maintained parallelly.
Still be clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request can also make this "self-understandable".
The supply and safety of people are in the forefront.
Clearly, however, "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People must know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, even not across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously notified, also Slovenia wanted to allow refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the way minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach saw it.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenian does not want to lock down its limits for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government noted, the first refugees had tried to pass by the Tovarnik/Sid border in Eastern Croatia during the night hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police was able to catch them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles have been constantly encountered with new refugees.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghanes, including many women and children.
Also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is expected with about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media consistently on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade contradicts that it is to tell people to take certain routes: "We can't, we don't want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid at the beginning of the day, further buses would be expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border of about 500 kilometres away.
"We have heard that Hungary has made up, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
In fact, it could come to a somewhat more western route to the previous route of Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Serbia, as already predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Supercussion of border control"
Croatian Inner Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Gengen member has "developing possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have been making a good witness to the country since then, as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian borders.
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent last night at the crossing of Horgos, leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgo and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local eyelight in Horgos: he thinks that the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed is early.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
We cannot say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes have been signed by Croatia.
However, the crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, mining fields that are still not cleaned.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining spacers was sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hackers: Ukrainers pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is supposed to have been a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of increasing insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information available is supposed to have made insider businesses on the financial markets.
In this way, the detectives have been exhausted by over $100 million.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accuseds in the case continued.
Most of the accuseds come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The criminals are supposed to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospital Assistance Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a governmental operation.
People take their cares, partly fast steps, partly cozyly bubbling.
They control the two stations of Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
Hold city trains.
Pulsing, profound life at a magnificent autumn sunlight and in the midst of four large tablets each with the heading "Before I die"....
The Ecumenic Hospital Assistance made this action aware of its 20-year-old existence and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenian Hospital Assistance is available to the passengers as well as to questions and discussions as to the official staff.
While a passenger spontaneously grabs the crystal about "yes my life", "can read", "run through the camper", "stop the war" or "not suffer" supplemented, others remain short, read, say sentences like "so far I am not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions on the action on itself, on life, dealing with death develop.
Peter Hübinger is also just on the place.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will eventually come to me, I can live responsible," says the director of the Diaconic work Mannheim, who is collaborated with the Caritas Association with the Ecumean Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this public-effective action is good for 20-year-olds.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, but it is understandable, eventually it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death has still been held with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lammer, although the Hospital movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An appreciation that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and grief companion is among the officials of the first hour.
By personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenian Hospital Assistance called for Honorary officials, it immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospital of Sankt Vincent.
They are all thoroughly trained.
Angelika Godefroid can well handle her task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free and independent.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of family and associations enables training and training and supervision of death and grief companions.
Every two years, training for new collaborators is offered.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal wishes can also be recorded on post cards.
FedEx results mixed, financial perspectives for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced his profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his soil transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire some 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year, which ends in next May, 20 cent less than in the previous prediction.
Analytists expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
Despite the price increases averaged 4.9 per cent and being effective on 4 January, and in spite of higher land transport supplements, heavy and large packages raised from November.
The company said that, however, it is expected that the result from the previous year will increase due to cost reductions, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces strict yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than those of the Competitive UPS, which plans to terminate 90,000 to 95.000 additional workers, approximately the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, almost behind the $2.44 per share, who foretold twelve of Zacks Investment Research interviewed analytists.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has had a decline in international priority shipping, which brought sales in his unit of Express shipping to stagnation.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 per cent in soil transport, but the operational result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result was decreased due to higher labour costs in the cargo business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve Straten spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead interest for the first time for almost a decade.
Threating above them at the end of the decorated two-stage meeting room is a wall image of the United States.
The card is a reminder of the fact that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold contract from the Congress: keep the maximisation of US employment and prices here stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to foretell it. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to get exposed to the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate nearly zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they grow solidly, the recent turbulences on global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed Representatives worried to reinforce this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and should it be only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Certainly the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the Makler Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertains the financial market.
About half of the economists who have recently been consulted by Bloomberg have foretold an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect awaiting the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of increase.
This indicates a decline in the share market if the Fed increases the set, unless the streets reduce the stroke by promiseing that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average was 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed Policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "it must go very far in her statement to reassure the financial markets, so that they don't get panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would reassure the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
A month ago, the fat seemed to be a good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points in this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, it would expect an increase in the sentence this year.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed considers to be full-employed.
Payment increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can manage higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world ended the last month after China had devaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% under its highest level in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would disturb global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed Representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracting the crush at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. note bank staff.
Now he foretells that she will wait at least one month to get better control of the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The central bank's influence has been huge in recent years.
The only indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "blown" its monetary expansion, resulted in confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly merged, the Fed representatives can expect them to monitor developments not only elsewhere but also consult other central banks and experts to improve their understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial market movements that seem not linked to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who seeks to increase interests, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as examples.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to reduce its leading interest rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings "notwithstanding limited noticeable effects on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed Representatives repealed these reductions.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market breakdown, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Committee on Interest Settlement.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not think that it should run ahead of time.

Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To welcome you warmly, do not go without the commitment of a countless official assistant.
In Hoyerswerda there are also a number of people who support unusual asylum candidates in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker home at Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a whole different lesson than at a right school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to inform women in a shocking way about the importance of good diet during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking at breasts painted with pictures of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories to about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calories are not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should take.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy diet of pregnant women really affects the genes of their babys and protects them from developing tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Bernrider Sportshalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction application for the €2.3 million expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be smoother for the solar system.
The plans for the long-dependent tour hall construction at Bernrider Sports sites are progressive: in the recent municipality session, the built-up application was fully blessed without major discussions.
The body had previously decided, among other things, an application for a construction "exception" and "exemption" from the valid cultivation plan.
The "exception" was the authorization for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Thus, a "Sattletag with non-mittent first and roof-over" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will bring us together a wonderful large south roof," stated Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "release" was, again, the ceiling that is to be less than ten degrees for energetic reasons - different from in the cultivation plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was therefore required because the cultivation plan on the roofing does not allow "exceptions" - whereas the Bernrider municipality usually is rather restrictive in applications for exemption.
However, in turnhallen construction, it is not a recurrent project: "We do not create a precedential case," says Steigenberger.
The turnhallen building at the sports center is a Community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Support is expected from school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now submitted to the Landratamt for testing.
Clinic Pietenberg moves to Schongau
The Pizzenberg Hospital is intended to be closed earlier than planned, namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Pizzaberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the district confirmed by Country Council Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pizzenberg would continue to work.
The main majority was to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The employees who are not able to go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-White.
The staff are informed about the plans.
The change has resulted in the announcement of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the year's beginning and now switches to a private practice in closer proximity to the hospital.
In the question of who to join the successor, according to Jochner-White, the name "Fisher" came into the game, which declared himself willing to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "revaluation" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine", said Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heart-step makers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized on gastroenterological disorders at the inner station.
Transitionally for the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees with both houses, fishermen are supposed to lead them until the previous casualty hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pizzenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the rural circle had planned this for 2018 when the current refurbishment at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, stood against rumors that the house in possession of the Bundesknappschaft will be used as accommodation for asylum webs in the future.
"I'm excluding it." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-White could not say there are several thoughts.
There is currently a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said fishermen on the quasi move to the lech, which was "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the doctor director.
The Pietenberg Hospital (early 100 beds) has been constantly threatened by closing over the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are demanded tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the mountain HC.

Jagdunfall with two injured people at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernten on a maize field at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in operation, as the police informed.

How exactly the accident could happen was first unclear.
Criminal Police Detected.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz victims of violent crime
An acting suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds missing since Saturday from Rheinland-Pfalz.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing young people and throwing their bodies into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rheinland-Pfalz who has been missing since Saturday has been victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on the Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state prosecutors and police informed us on Wednesday.
As suspicious, a 20-year-old arrested person also considered suspected and led the detectives to the foundation of the body on the night of service.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the first evening after a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When looking for the young woman, the detectives first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing ones, there was eventually a suspect of action against the 20-year-olds.
The suspected transgressor then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested officer admitted to the authorities in the police interrogation that killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the detectives put him to death.
Disclosure of the circumstances of the action is intended to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment gaps
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
Even more and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
Pressure on the apartment market grows.
Social housing is faced with a challenge.
The distribution fights on the German housing market have long started.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They are competing with poor income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for payable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
The result is a study in order of the association "Social housing building".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in a first-up accommodation than asylum seekers.
Many then hit the apartment market and enter the long snakes before the rental apartments.
According to the Statistical Federal Office, however, less than half of all asylum applicants lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only a result of the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also constitutes considerable neglects in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing out a housing deficit, which grows from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 residential units were missing in the balloon areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flame on the apartment market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen back in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the League proposes a restart.
New incentives are intended to stimulate social housing.
In this way, the basic tax could be rejected and the basic tax could be suspended temporarily for funded apartments.
In addition, according to the Alliance, there is a need for attractive tax depreciation.
The funding programme for refugee accommodations by the State Bank KfW is already very good in cities and communities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the around 300 million euros were already collected on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free leadership: Croatia and Slovenia set up the corridor
To Hungary, there is practically no more throughcoming, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it is free to provide the journey through Slovenia to the north.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the dismantling of the Serbian Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken out to Croatia to get from there to West Europe.
500 people came across the border to Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had locked its border for refugees in the morning.
New laws that entered into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures practically excessive in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can go through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are here, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and taxes to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
Although at the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not hit borders.
There are other dangers in the borders: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining spacers are now supposed to create a safe passage quickly.
Yet, after the border is closed, there are little more refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before Thursday on Monday, there had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws embrace the overcoming and damage of the border tongue as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged.
The condemned threatened penalties up to five years and the dismissal from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established transit zones on Tuesday, of which almost all - 93 - were accepted in the main transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
However, practically no one has the prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum candidates are to be disposed of there.
Before the "Transitzone" in Roszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered together.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the street edge in recent weeks.
Lock grids were cut off and one of the recording camps in the border location was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this reconstruction.
Austria reaches only few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
But about 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to governmental statements.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped on the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In free lassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met at foot.
Mayor drove "Strading" across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with travel bags stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had been surprised on Sunday because of the refugee stream, the railway traffic with Austria was for her in Wernstein concluded," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranges along with two other helpers and their cars driving across the border to near Passau.
Previously, we had the unforeseen guests, with Jause and drinks.
We just said we brought them to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"We've been very happy," said Stadler.
On Sunday night, the train passengers were climbing from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening, to try over the border after the short term announcement that rail transport was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was placed before the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the crossing of the border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associates with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, day before a two-bridge cycle sportally - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from New Church.
That Viktor Orbán now sends another cig thousands to us, is a logical result of a spectacular policy:
Instead of helping in the Roszke camp instantly with the creation of structures that ensure humanity, our federal Chancellor has highly officially and publicly pushed the position of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of national socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the borders.
Also the refugees will have to find that the "promised land" which they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create humanitarian conditions for protective seekers in view of the persistent refugee streams and the near winter.
And it will be even greater - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee stay full of hands.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful rail iron banker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first-up center of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was done without a big spine, Conrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85.000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35.000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 countries will provide 15 000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But there's no fat without the ground," said Konrad.
He has already conducted discussions with the heads of the country.
They would have promised him to create quarters for the future refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will be announced how the church will help.
Large expectations also put the asylum coordinator into the ORF action "Help as we".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized last night the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it could not be that quartier donors have to keep a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
For a period of time, "Not standards" should apply.
The fact that he was more successful in staying, in contrast to the Ministry of Interior, justifies Conrad with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not telling the truth without anything else.
Consciousness is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they explained themselves.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four.
Your own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as a office.
However, it seems that there are problems with approval.
Linz demands a better division
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz is planning.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the subjects are currently able to live without these measures, says mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations are to be checked for their skill.
The city head is criticizing the division of refugees within the state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Grenzen are not locked up"
In a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pehringer (VP) accompanied the further approach in the question of refugees on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not locked down.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are just the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From other EU Member States, Pühringer called for more solidarity in the refugee matter.
The fact that Austria is now bringing back controls at its borders is "a logical result" for Pehringer from the German action.
Next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general analyzing of the "New Werf" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the börsen-enoted IT Group S&T has been withdrawn, the remainder (2700 square meters) is intended to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in start-up companies of the new shipyard and later also acquire any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises some: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is deployed for 60 years by Linz AG to S&T as well as the Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for further 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-Inhabitant opened second business in the Arcade
In the new shop Furla handbags are centered.
Actually, Jutta wanted to lay a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubemarkt-Arcade shortly: it has finally grown in the form of another business room.
In the Furla shop compared to the shop in which they sell, including bags, bags, shoes and garments of various manufacturers, everything is now about the female handbags of the brand Furla, money exchanges are available from 75 euros.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
A number of weeks ago was rebuilt.
"I've been thinking for a long time if I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was vital, among other things, that Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also involved in the idea of their own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the big room of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got wide from her mother into the weeves.
I do most when something develops and I can show new trends at disgusting prices.
Why, when some women look at a beautiful handbag in deliciousness, the expert woman cannot answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit.
The browsing maker from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants were named agencies.
This property also associates some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he is opposing from a stranger, journalists are raging or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. Presidency's office is strongly up to the campaign of elections.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Pfalzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the peanut frisur is a concept for many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are over -ty corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
Simone Wendel, the Cold Cityer, played a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not even so deeply impressed in their cold towns," says Simone Wendel.
The bourgeois cold townster has turned a funny documentary film about the place and its famous sprouts, among which the Ketchup family Heinz is also included next to Trump.
Trump, which is not known for modesty, also comes to word in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of the hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to believe that Trump is "a little big mouth," says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surroundings, "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch, she says.
So, Trump comes from the village of the perpetrator.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the grandparents' lives were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to the homeland forever failed in the Bavarian state, among which the Pfalz was then.
He did not take Trump because he had once left away without authorization, the director of the Institute of Pfalz History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandson of an "injurious emigrant".
This is in contrast with the sometimes significant statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants.
"As the poltered, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative Trumps ("The Grandma was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The vineyard in retirement sees the American rather distant, "he is always so exhausting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Pension server Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family gave something to the church standards when visiting, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
You'd better find it if he didn't win the choice because "He has such radical views, I don't know if it's good."
If those who had been saying at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "whether he had never arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Sarah Bühler, Winzer daughter.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And, "The grapes will also mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed long, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, even in the United States, the interest is awakening.
The Upperbayer municipality of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park Berchtesgaden was awarded on Wednesday for gentle tourism.
There are already 20 "climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alps Association is responsible for the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protective area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson travel to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it did not make any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show by Nine was rayed out by the state capital when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with modern David Koch and Samantha Armydays, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 viewers in the five main cities, compared to Today 339.000.
Today, the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000) increased slightly, but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the hole of Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Up to September, Sunrise has an average of 349.000 viewers at 314.000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morningmen more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father, who decided to join his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.

On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour was 7700,000.
Hot seat average 620 000.

The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that did not manage to overflow the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery contained? ...
Lana Jeavons Flows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unawarely have revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was caught in the largest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Flows on the day before we get out of three, you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrically exposed to the reasons why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for their desire to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last Rose?", their answers could become the degrader who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, then I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it's so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as couples.
From their point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made her clear that Wood "the One" could be.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreserved on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose wood, if not she, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls likewise - it's a distinction between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be rayed on Wednesday 19:30 on ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a gerangel as it did the Aussie-Rugby-Liga convertit at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also into the current game after a injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of painting his smokes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzs at a point that was restored in the first play area by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian succession had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 106, that he couldn't imagine any worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens now, one only cares for the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original Debüt in 2007 when a passport in his own in-Goal area led to a test for Queensland.
In total, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian role field with weapons.
Following his open challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, captured his oil company Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The free choosers demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bayern due to the high numbers of refugees.
Partie and group head Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt against a serious crisis in Bayern's schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Before we will get discards in the Bavarian educational system."
The country day fraction of the Free Electors will take place until Friday in the under-frankish municipality.
In fact, there were quite different main topics.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meetings.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overcome the clausur," said Aiwanger.
Awanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"This is not the way it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Wähler-Chef.
Rejected asylum candidates want to move free choosers as soon as possible.
Therefore, Awanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states all over the world."
"Bayers move away, others don't."
"We need to become more handlingable."
However, the country's policy in the city of Great Wall is not supposed to fall under the table.
A long-term permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Cultural Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 gymnasia launched the pilot's "Mediterranean level plus" testing an extension of the high school average level from three to four years - as a result it will take again nine years to the abiture.
But this is not far enough for a pregnant.
"The topic G9 must be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnasias who want to.
Free drive at G9 wherever it is desired.

Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax tip.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" has been seen from the weekend.
Thus investors are currently giving too little attention to the German Chipbauer.
In this context, investments in future wafer technologies and focus should be paid on the automotive market.
Car values were asked: Even in the traditionally weak summer month August, more cars were shut down than in the previous years, as the Acea Branch Association announced to start the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber shots on demonstrations in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new Constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
On the Tuesday evening, the violence broke out in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Office, said that more than 1,000 demonstrations had gathered outside a police station, some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they took back on rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were hurt, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shots, of which they are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The controversy was the last of the weeks of violent protests in the southern part of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who wants to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new Constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centralized for centuries.
The work on a new Constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitutional Draft in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

The city of Emden had already purchased a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / corner Large Street and had the building that was on it ripped off.
Project Hive: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home dwelling at the small sea at Emden take form.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some people are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational recreation
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, crushed, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday house house on the small sea near Emden are on the table.
On Monday evening, the stakeholder, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time in the City Development Committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, which was confronted with the investor and the administration of mystery cruelty, Ralf Behrends went from the system-building management to the offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all rumors now.
About 10 to 12 million euros expensive projects have been discussed for months.
Heavy reactions among seabudent owners who had come to the meeting called the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seabudent owner and member of the Board of Directors at the stakeholders, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant collar that surpasses all the other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would grow strongly by the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads in order to calculate it," said Schulz.
However, what is happening exactly on the well a hectare area of the former guest place is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a firm concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Twin-news at Gorillas in Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with the success of his gorillas.
The 26-year-old diane brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years away and had been in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet firm, since Mother Dian keeps them close to the body so far.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cycling south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center foretold a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical spinal storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, such as in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60-percentage potential to form a tropical spinal storm in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google starts double donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (Googl. O) announced a doubling donation campaign to spend $11 million for humanitarian organisations, which will help thousands of refugees who have overrolled the European nations, as they flee from the war broken and armed countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announce the donation call on his blog.
Instead of allowing a manager to make an announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"One of our trips included many dark rail and bus trips, as well hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are available to four commonly useful organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: physicians without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to 5.5 million on google.com/refugeelief are doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, which is largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has expelled more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from the war broken Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetes patients, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-operative treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in humans who are sickly fatty with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obesity.
Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of adipositas surgery - stomach bypass and snake formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In addition, the BMI remained in those who received non-operative diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% dissolved the diabetes disease completely and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percent and partially by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of controls of blood pressure, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'chirurgic' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflect the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, writes researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical group, it remained stable at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, says the leader researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastretomie group (18.7 vs. 14,2 kg), increased decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1 %) and more complete overcoming diabetes (46.9 % vs 16.7 %).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group who tried conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any advantage of survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was reassuring for persons with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have connected their bodies firmly with fatness and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly aware of in Belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and inconsistent in school times, reappears after years the sword of her youth, and she is in love with her.
Likewise, in the recent novel "We are not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Besides the love history, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in boredom and surrounding towns.
The main professional author has grown up in boring and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which devotes itself to ethical studies.
He requested that the interests of humanity be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances given.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admired, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria commended its efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and showed that the violent reaction of the United States led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolence in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is in violentness.
"I know his motives were good, but he took violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increases in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swallow strong alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of revenue of hand-disinfected agents in children under 12 years of age, reporting toxic control centres, increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.617 in 2014.
"Kids are getting more and more frequently on these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a mute sample in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Adolescents claim to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water in order to get a harder drink.
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with soil, wine grapes and orange scents that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Vigilance Center at the Kansas University Hospital, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let any swallow whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in reach of children, and when children get there, then it's a quick way to use much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays from scented hand disinfectants after earthberry in the school, was brought to a emergency recording.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah repaired her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain-trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and shot her head, said Ritchey.
"This was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
Besides alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Personnel of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was recorded as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth class students in the State of New York planned to poison her "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the educational room," says a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned her from her room.
The police viewed the plan as "speaking" and pointed discipline measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a racing accident on the cross-spange between North Ring and Herdenen, a 33-year-old car driver has been easily injured.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-spange to the circular transport industry area and noticed too late that two advanced vehicles had stopped during the circulation.
As a result, he robbed his truck into the back of an audit and pushed this vehicle on a Ford Fiesta above.
The accidental vehicles were damaged by case of approximately EUR 10,000, and the police informed.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be dropped.

Dons increase leadership over Celtic on five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half time, Aberdeen gave a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about disharmony down
There are rumours about disharmony in Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his teammates were not under increased control because they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers medieval player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent excretion from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10-mans from Aberdeen, which now stands with five points of predominance clearly at the top of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton carefully at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, suggesting that he pointed out some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new access and maintains that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox catering.
The ex-Chairman of Brentford said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instructions
Swansea Stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract went out with the Swans.

Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the red map of the defendant was later lifted - the third red map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said and persevered: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The infinite Hibee was reproved after he admitted to have sung a song with stumbling texts about Ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a trick in the area of Roseburn in Edinburgh in March 2014, in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the storm and added: "It's sure to say that I'm not returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United-Management
Simon Donnelly perseveres that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admits that the decline has to end in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to bring the boys back to Trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "unclean".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies in order to see a seven-in-a-line league, which brought them a five-point front Celtic at the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elf meter in the first half time.
McInnes said: "There is no crew who has won everything, in pocal games or leagues, which have not even won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it increases overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July by 164.000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the rate of 5.5 per cent in the UK, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the UK average of 73.5 per cent during the quarter.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
The drunkenness disturbed the course
Since security staff couldn't satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to keep the disturbances safe.
A atemal coal test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The growing one was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained in preservation at first.
Why I will be a witness to a execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses at his death.
The invitation had already been made over his best friend in January for the first time, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists may see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications available than places, a macabulary lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephones and a two and a half hours visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing a lot when we talk.
The prisoners say I can't be a Witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining with her.
She admitted that she could have made it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could remove me from his Witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of action.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
To convince a man to get out of the Canning River for moist police persecution
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
An attempt from Perth to depend on the police was unsuccessful when he was in sight and sucky water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "to convince him gently to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale Police was called to a house peace break in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired inhabitants to the humorous planning of a Ben cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to stop the race sports
Peter Moody claims that Stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his places last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a racing treatment, the last strashhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the race sport and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt-tupfer sample for Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had retained 18 months because of the spionage accusations and didn't want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I intend to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting a long time on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to circumvent the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do this, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - which I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my places to deliver information about what I do in my places," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a deceiver.
If that is the case, they should surely grab their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still present.
Should this make me think it's personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and may make people outside trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say lets them think about it now.
But now I've arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exert pressure on them and press them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer has built up with the long-lasting Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to his saying that he could "go his license over the table."
Moody, best known by preparing the unblowed master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule "shameful", after a pack of mud or tone was placed on the horse legs, which disputed against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my employees wrongly placed mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been the whole day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on the racing day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the packaging on the racing day.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you went too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver flight
In the weekend, the police arrested a man after a hit with a cyclist and subsequent driving flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley motorway.
The police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia came to Shepparton Police.
It is expected to be accused of driving flights and deficits and other traffic crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy called criticism in tackling his players as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "Ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in rings.
Bellamy defended his team's thanks and said they were focused only on their "contact" when they were tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team would be confident, since it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"There appears again and again - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Thankles to a real focus, and that has made the trend to us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny how this happens again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "language" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his type of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are you making breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the play plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team will be free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the prefinal at AAMI Park. Ticket sales begins from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug charge
A man who may threaten a lifelong punishment for his attempt to possess 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came over Vanuatu from South America and laid in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his colleagues in the harbour during the morning and later in the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly lifelong punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that it could have been for an harmless reason in the café.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security to reach his release.
"After reading the native statements of the two people, it is clear that the issue of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against caution, under the conditions that he releases his Australian and his Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds a starting block of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Guide house breaks apart
In an accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver has been severely injured on the service night.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction station towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid leftwards at the last moment, as the police informed.
The headquarters of the accident causer was completely distinguished.
The driver was severely injured to a hospital.
The A5 between Brushsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was an injury of EUR 122.000.
Stevan Hogg used a phone from girls to lock pedophile for sending pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logged in a online messaging service, from which he received a series of unfair pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web researches that used terms for looking for unfair images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then "usually to be a policeman to scare them".
State prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addict - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on his computer were performed by him, but he said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the unpleasant pictures on the phone and confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the prosecution to have recorded unfair images of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the requirements on January 25 this year and not appeared before the court for a hearing on March 24, this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg would not appear in the register of sexual criminals, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the judgment until October in order to obtain background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a deposit but was investigated because of consultations with other cases still outstanding.
It was added to the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Sleuser equates to small border transitions to Germany
More and more refugees are taken off the main control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers left people more and more at smaller border transitions from fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a speaker of the Federal Police.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been attacked in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking over bridges and booths on the German side.
There they are receipt by federal policemen and forwarded for registration.
At Munich's main railway station, more refugees came back to federal police information compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
Only at 8:00 a.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austria border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Triggers of Tropenstorm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across West Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) informed Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the runner of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunders are especially expected in baths.
According to DWD, the black forest, the Swabic Alb and the soil sea circuits are still expected to have blows of 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, then, the sun can be looked longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years the car builders on the IAA show their new things.
In 2015, the compact cars are particularly well sold.
Cars from the compact class are currently specially demanded: around 28.1 percent of the new authorisations were found on this segment in August alone, according to the Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (releases 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premiums for the German automobile industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell well the volume model, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel sets up a entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
The Hessen also offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three cylinder benzines for the first time.
In contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five-doors.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the Combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what's next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the fair, the Mégane is seen exclusively as a fifth door in a conventional and emphasized sporty GT version.
He comes into trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a comb.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
The Nissan delegate wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its swollen lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, a diesel is also offered with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
Offers will be the model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer data.
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but renewed around is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën delegator put hand on the front party: Here the cooler bar was rearranged and the modified luminaires were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants, such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, were held at the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: 5 square meters cell are human insignificant
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a former prisoner of the Court of Justice Tegel, who had stayed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the injury of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when they are in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can hope for money even if they were only a few days in the narrow rooms (Act.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-fighter with his constitutional difficulties in Karlsruhe was successful: he was located in the Berlin Tribunal between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Then, according to his lawyer, the man who was now on the free foot again was moved into a larger cell.
His complaint about the unworthy conditions of arrest against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges raised the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for the re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Chamber Court now decides on the height of the compensation
Although for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are significant, it said a compensation claim.
Otherwise, "a worsening of the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of money compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked locked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, a multi-laboration of a cell without a separate toilet, is inappropriate.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Constitutional Court of Berlin on Wednesday, which certified a human inferior stay to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant had stayed in a cell similar to Karlsruher case between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months.
The Berlin prisons have also come into the headlines during the last few weeks because of lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are repeatedly included in 23 hours, the aggression increases, even fighting has already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 places in Tiles are not occupied for deficiency, 19 are supposed to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Approximately 800 000 asylum candidates will come to Germany this year, according to the predictions of the Federal Ministry of Industry, according to vice-cancer Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What happens to Germany gives the following overview.
It is used by different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments each year - the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is built to date (250000 apartments).
In dramatic terms, there is a lack of housing, but especially in the case of payable hire objects: every year 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these particularly favourable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Federal construction minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion, from 518 million to one billion euros at present.
The Pestel Institute's view is far too low: 80,000 social homes should be created annually and the Federal Republic should invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Researchers and Federal Ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment and Vocational Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany can be working on the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to the appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-equality of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Threnhardt.
According to Threnhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the ban on refugees' work for recognition of work.
While there was a work ban for asylum candidates of up to five years earlier, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation to restrict asylum candidates to a place of residence.
In society, also due to the lack of professionals, most of them have seen that refugees should be allowed more quickly to access the labour market.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is still no sufficient offer for general and professional language courses.
Investigations also show that jobs are most frequently communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Threnhardt, the Kingsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children into the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together first," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senat Management.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes hands in different languages.
If the large number of refugees increases in the need for teachers, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity - for example by allowing more scholarships.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for the classes of welcome.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack on them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum candidates or dulded the study - the only exception was until Berlin, Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits in accordance with the asylum application law when they start a study.
In principle, the latter will not receive Bafög because they do not fall within the circuit of those who are eligible.
Duld refugees must have lived four years in Germany in order to be Bafög-justified, as from 1 January 2016, these tensions are shortened to 15 months.
However, this financial gap must also be closed, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German student work.
Students should be given Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is a major part of their identity.
The State should grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish a Islamic Welfare Association that cares professionally for the newcomers.
Rights include obligations.
Thus, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it certain control opportunities.
This also includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to live here, in Germany," he said at the Bavarian radio.
He proposed that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic of the entire society.
In this way, the majority society will also need to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, for a decade a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-White Germans have long demanded and what international agreements as the anti-racism convention Germany require must be reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - in the interests of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says Prime Minister Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With regard to man power and capacity, we can do this," he said to the daily mirror.
However, additional money needs to flow into the system for this.
In order to avoid patches, Montgomery demands to deliver health cards immediately at registration.
The benefits provided could later be discounted with the Federal Countries.
And in the long term it is most questionable to eat so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided by the asylum application law.
Otherwise, doctors are especially making the language barriers.
So far, according to the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in medical practices, interpreter costs have to be taken, she demands.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical facilities in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV information.
With the partially other pictures of disease, German doctors would be clear from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And with regard to the lack of doctors, refugees may even be in sight of relieving.
The Syrians had a highly developed educational system, some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they need to prove their qualifications and possibly to carry out tests again.
At least half of the refugees who arrive in Germany are psychically ill, according to estimated by the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic disturbance or depression.
Especially injurious are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study of the TU Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany.
Those who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heartbeat and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances, strong terribleness and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
However, to date only four percent of psychically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices most experts or doctors who are not educated for psychiatric diseases would decide whether or not treatment is necessary.
This often leads to misrespects, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new "Leitness" stage, the Circus proves react to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probe invites to the manege on the tile water to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, Animal Teacher and Junior Chief.
"Leitness" - under this motto is the current mangen insension.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people out of their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegencocktail with World Town-Flair", says director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in their ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the stupid films, it wants to take the Cuban Duo loose.
Easyness and movement - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmons, the acrobatics of the Circus sample are also fascinating with finger tip feeling and jointness.
Balance with the single wheel on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
Fascinate and scare snake humans at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their movement.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte sample.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus are all too often topics in various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not good, it's not good for us."
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strip unit.
The "four-bound artists", as they are lovingly called, will be read away from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it doesn't want to go to the manege either.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebra Stute, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a walk for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte sample.
The Zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, but for that it is the unique maskot of the Circus sample.
So for each visitor, there is probably something to do with it.
"One is safe," says Stephanie, "whether five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Probst invites daily at 17 and 20 a.m. from 17 to 20 September.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 17 o'clock the prices are reduced.
The animal view is also open every day from 10 to 18 p.m.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the staircase from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also grieved by the assertions of Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with Buhrufen.
Last month they had built him up and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against disturbing Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The Chief Speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers of politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year divide into two stock-notated companies and separate the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing business hardware and its service business activities.
The expected job degradation leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in an explanation.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who wants to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has over $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on the provision of unavailable, integrated technology solutions for companies," says the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the place of birth of the Silicon Valley".
HP has been through a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team colleagues must stand behind the wounded Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
A few more emphasised to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain in the next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old turn during the front season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his knees or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a pure medical perspective, but as wingers also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injuries, every time a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops a unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six out of eight times since 2007/08, most of the days of injury.
A few more accept the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a susceptible period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Todtenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and wenger has a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
The winner can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little break," said Vinger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue by Group F, the Maksimir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been missed after 41 games after the "indefeitable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by a earthquake on Tuesday evening, measured on the judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
No more believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope of leading the association to its first Europe-pokal triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is evident, especially with regard to the need for men to open themselves, now even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a terrible life) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the fight to cope with this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "soft mood", his chances for healing doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style about substance, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has the need to appear strong, vital and successful, doubled, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Every character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequently embraced, moments of football watching in cozy seats and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it at any rate, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of telephone seal care explained to me, "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicide threatened, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech "I'm dealing with" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is seen as a weakness when you speak openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind to me when I try to offer more long-term handling mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone may help people at moments of despair, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFestival with the totally newly designed scenery of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meet to help PSG crush malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move by to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advance when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they seek not only the qualifications for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they received the points, there was no class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustrated career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and relaxe looking back, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which in the weekend could hold a 2:2 unavoidable place against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was elected by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian wing turm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he finished by Johan Wiland beautifully in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, came to the field at Anpiff with nine national players and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes resigned, with some failure paces and bad grades, not least by Ibrahimovic, who patched at no less than five trials alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Yet, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria transformed into a turn shot that was passed by Wiland in the 52th minute at the pound ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer thus achieved his sixth seasonal tower, after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This concluded all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could be low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was reappeared a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norweger said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifications are not enough."
Get away from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion by stock sales
The mining rice Glencore in Switzerland, which is affected by disrupting raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by a share sale as part of its huge debt debt debt debt plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in an explanation that it has sold new shares of approximately £1.6 billion in order to pay its own debts.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese Staatspresident Xi Jinping will make a public visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis' first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan this evening with a state-diner after the two leaders of the state have conducted bilateral discussions.
"President Xi's visit will offer the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but will also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to deal constructively with areas of disagreement," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was announced first in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial questions, including Washington's concerns about claimed cyberspionage China and its growing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS portfolio hired and driven to waste
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and leaned out a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy motorway, the evil wake up came.
In a company in the Gotha district, you can fulfill the dream and once rent and drive a V8 US fort Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
This is how a 29-year-old man from the Gotha district did.
At the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, went on a wet railway into the sludge and drove to the lead board.
The sports car suffered total damage, nobody was hurt.
The damage is estimated to EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was evidently a few years ago in advance of the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish master, three times pocal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
Yet, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the EM 2008 before the Barcelona divorce.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't do anything," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bayern."
"Rommenigge wanted me."
For memory: In summer 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change.
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the crew without me."
"So he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's time 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League's quarterfinale against the Bayers over the entire distance on the grass, switched the reds off (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation down
Matt Damon confronted the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a sequence of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actress Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives, with regard to a black protagonist in the selected project's turnbook.
"If we talk about diversity, you will do it when you occupy the movie and not when you occupy the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted ignorance and called "Hoo! Wow. OK," when the comments of the actor of The Martian were stuck.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show fans.
"I want people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is beaten by her white collar.
The producer of Dear White People sat down for the finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the government rights of the film; Damon replied that their government could give us something we don't want.
After the discussion was launched, the social media exploded before disappointment about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - that's SO WISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement achieved a country-wide effect and urged lawyers and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colorful obstacles.
In February, the singer Prince made an example of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said (albums still have their significance).
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox-News personality of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a hatred group.
"The Black Live Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls that were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Profi sports climber and service aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which has just completed its seventh season, has never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all the stages of his barrier parcours.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to finish.
One of the last tasks was climbing at a 75 feet long climb rope in 30 seconds.
Britts completed the task within the time he was the first athlete who completed the effortful phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge completely three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hardly fought victory, still under the shock about the profit of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading manufacturer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brits, although he was the first to finish the parcours, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's cruel about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received plenty of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight stack, the rotation work will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sleeve by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not funny for Detroit Tigers.
In the past they were one of the best teams in the baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but this part played perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F word, which was so difficult to believe over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the nineth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 Innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to finish this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go very concentrated into the game.
The designed Tiger heater Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swooped the timber well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (suite training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh innings, the twins had their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mur, the only man he was confronted with, before the designed smoker Miguel Sano, who entrissed a two-run to Drew Verhagen's right hand.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, the funeral brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27 in the Major League in this season that Plouffe hit a double play
When Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created a RBI double against the closer of Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the position of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stood out Sano at three pitches for his fifth saving.
Detroit benefited from a Phil Hughes that was not yet moving.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand veneran, which had been deleted from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Certainly not the beginning I wished," said Hughes, "but I felt better than I loosed and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third entrance."
After they first received the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" at the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a big hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not achieve points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever's legal hand A.J.Etter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez expired because of a injury to the warp schools.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a scoring, is intended to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July.
He has missed since August 20 because of a decay in the right hip gel.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees will live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people therein are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden announced on the service evening.
She counted with 450 to 750 arrival refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1,000 refugees may stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government Bureau responsible for initialisation, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Also Frankfurt and Hanau have established emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria as an opportunity.
"I think that the decisive thinking of military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He called on the European States to "collectively look away".
Four years ago, it was a joy that the Kelch had passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is cracking in front of our door," he said at the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared on the service evening at the Austrian television station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement in which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany in this respect.
Concrete figures did not mention them and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU Heads of State and Government.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting, the EU Ministers want to take a new start on the binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee change in Germany, the covenant wants to support the countries more in the initialisation and distribution of people.
The covenant will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced at the late Tuesday after nearly four-hour discussions with the Prime Ministers of the Office of Cancer in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those who need protection are also available.
However, those who do not have a lead perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was divided in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the night on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania should be locked down with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia from the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent Slepper from seeking escape routes over Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto on the planned new border town.
The Romanian Government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the door.
In Turkey, there are thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Space sun "Cassini" finds the ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icespancer of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean is swimming.
This closes researchers from observations of the space zone "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily tumbles on its track around the ring planets.
Although this dumb movement is only small but still too large for a constantly fixed heavenly body, a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) says of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the Icarus Fachblatt.
It was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the southern pole of the Saturn moon, spearing water vapour and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least on the southern pole there was a underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to abstain from officer Valdet Rama about a month.
A study revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "expected four weeks of compulsory break".
"That's hard for us, Rama's a hard loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün of the "Picture" performance with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Mrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shock next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to join the course train.
Okotie had been injured in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collaboration on the head.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blessur.
No diet fruit - Mangos contains much sugar
Mangos are exotic and soft-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his narrow line, he is often more disguised by them.
For mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins and vitamins E and C are in them. However, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-grade beta carotine.
Thus, the one who eats the fruits supports visibility, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly.
The scaling color alone doesn't matter how mature the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
But a mango also gives a special note to hearty courts.
It mildens the slightly bitter taste of some leave salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangogutney fits well for fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The UPS UPS UPS offers up to 95000 aids for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched.
The UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 aids last year.
In view of the growing online business, UPS and his competitor FedEx have been taking measures last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliverys had introduced harsh criticism to the package services.
First Fancy Storm, then outstanding cold front
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpine North Side of the Feans, is breaking through, as Meteoschweiz informed on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night on Thursday, the figs partly blow with storm starch through the peanuts.
After springing on Thursday morning, we are crossed by a striking cold front that brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast deep printing area across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpine North side breaks through the valleys in the night on Wednesday.
As a result, the peanut blows up to Thursday morning in the peasant valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km/h, separately and in particular in the Urnerland partially also with over 100 km/h.
The peanut can step forward to the neighbouring Mediterranean, and the mountains are even possible with orcan bows of over 120 km/h.
During the north on Wednesday, stormy peanuts provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture at the south of the Alps begins to steam.
Here the rain stops until Thursday evening.
In total south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, with partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter, this has already fallen large quantities of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the peanut goes out the air, resulting in a cold front rolling over Switzerland with strong, partially vigorous rain from West to East.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshs strongly to stormy, and temperatures decline significantly.
The following days are present in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it becomes sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther spot
Almost 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin Luther spot in Rome.
On Wednesday, in the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, an unnamed place was baptized on the Uppio hill in the park on the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now considered a German theologian of the Reformation.
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Colosseum.
The names had been requested by the work community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, parish of the Evangelical-Lutherian community in Rome, reminded us on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of Popes over centuries as a minority often could live only in the hidden.
The place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed a few months in Rome as a young Augustin monk around the 1510/11 season.
He felt the city then as a lost babble of sin.
His negative impressions seem to have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening church with his thesses against the disposal trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (old) crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning, the image was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated his entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is not even meaningful with "lusty" images.
On the contrary, the relevant topics can be quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjective-artistical selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Cycles are created that devote themselves to such topics as crossways, plagues, commandments or Father’s Ours.
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And above all, there is the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, disputed with the respective Bible texts.
He interpreted the texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and a set of artists, which here forms his very personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus the 75-year-old also allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately a result of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Werneigerode, and grew up in Berlin, come from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lordhuter order.
"Then the training was done with the pipestock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work this up, perhaps to be able to deal with the Lord's Father again."
His second concern is to help art again to be more worthwhile in fast-living time: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today, and it is loud.
Symbolics are pushed out there.
Artists have another desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "take into the pictures," to let them act on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday to the presentation of the Otmar Old Bible in the Otmar Old Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old age did not take care of fully understanding the Bible, but chose the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"This wasn't a collaboration at eye height," says Altepost, "this is about the pictures that the text just explains." It was a picture Bible.
For Hans Mühler from the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alts pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love as well as those of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas - is presented in an exhibition that will be opened in the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Nearby BMX Railway Building Start
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth hills modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway, it was already finished again.
Failure in politics and administrations provided cracking, especially for the inhabitants who did not tolerate the railway.
So hills displaced, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction authorisation.
The approval will be received in October, the first municipality of Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now communicate in the Child and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year still happens visible," she said.
Then it was supposed to be started with the work at the former hall pool without a "external break in mind".
DFB intensifys commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment for refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga makes a clear sign in the weekend.
The football responds to the situation in Germany and ensures its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since the reunification."
"Nobody can in principle say that this is nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be interesting for each individual to handle this topic," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday at the office of the Kanzler, and I meet the Minister of State, Mrs Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and wants to help.
However, the decisive softness has to put policy.
The German Football Federation therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they are to bear on the left tricotary instead of the otherwise common sponsor logo (hermes) the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome".
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Picture" presentation ( Tuesday) and called the project "self-understandability".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one can look away."
"We football allies can, no, we need to use our radiation, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hopenheim's manager Peter Rettig spoke of a "predominant sign of the League".
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Sales for the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach called the support of refugees "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have published, is living in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already collected the whole sum for 2015," explained Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Head of Board loses an eye in case of accident
According to several reports, the director of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost the left eye by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident on the staircase in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a water glass after midnight, which he wore in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeded, was unpowered, then dragged out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could check his work.
"In October we meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "full of work."
McDermott announced in an interview with the South German newspaper (Thursday edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was regularly in contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually penetrates between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP center in Walldorf.
If it's important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen such a thing."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen except Fight ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was crashed by the wheel.
Thus, at the night race in Singapore in the weekend, he is as little as a reserve driver for the two family pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as is one week later at the big price of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: pastures in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus have ended in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the football bandesliga in the Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't get back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday at the Bundesliga Topspiel gegen Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professional, Tuchel will not only change its stamp on the giant position.
So he announced a change on the gatekeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfellers will be used in all European Liga games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He is likely to dispute the second party too.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, central field player Julian Weigl considers to be ambiguable: "This is not Marco's wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants a prerequisite role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be a technological precursor, in accordance with the will of the Federal Government.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the house of Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday, in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA, Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility timeline".
The automated and networked driving will increase transport safety and reduce the steadiness, said Dobrindt.
He also wishes to discuss the issue with his official colleagues from the G7 states, who also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The Strategy Paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid transition to digital radio.
For testing new techniques, a test route is currently created on the highway 9 in Bayern.
In order to 'no additional liability risks' to the driver, the Federal Government is aiming to 'check and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments'.
Thus, Germany wants to take an international effort to increase the maximum speed allowed for self-run cars from 10 to 130 hour kilometers.
The Federal Government also intends to work on a change in the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
When driving automaticly, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
Technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds.
Following a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatic driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected until far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver resistance systems and high-automatic driving functions at the location of Germany, the authors of the study estimate about EUR 8.4 billion for 2025.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD transport policyer Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute submitted on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the Dekra audit organisation results in that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 percent expect that only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents are expected to use automobile by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
After all, the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self-run vehicle.
After a survey of the digital companion Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to carry out control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, 15 percent could still imagine the flowing traffic, 45 percent.
Well every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll leaves team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to look up only in detail at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM teaching in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term date of sponsorship in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected on Friday.
"Without Timo the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamlener, who sets the set list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"In that time, Timo also missed, and we have become European champion."
"We should focus on this," explained the World Range List Fifths.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has drawn a severe injury on the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit and exchanged after long treatment at a tackling by Héctor Moreno.
The first diagnosis suggested a railbreak in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion views and a wax-figure grusel cabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: show window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfit, and with the fact that he put men in rocks.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from Citizen Climbing on the course), which is seen in the art Hall of the Hypo Culture Foundation from 18 September, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his initial rejective attitude to a show of his person.
Actually, he had been opposed, because "For me, a exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed total artwork for which a lot of effort has been done: For example, to refresh the dolls was committed specifically to a stylist.
14 tons of material the makers have carried to Munich according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special shamemaker: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different," said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sighty fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and poor in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, though, I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion view, he couldn't pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as fashion nisch
In the past, it went into the long sticking machines and to make plates about making meters.
The embroidered substances and peaks were created in a large amount for customers, for example, to further process to covers and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, director of the fashion tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, then was pushed by the home textile industry - and is now reappeared as a nice.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: top in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and regional tracts.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which is linked to past style epochs, represents an increasing contract potential.
Those who do not use nisch in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Branch Association of Plauen Spitze and Stickery.
Only they may carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of turnover has been broken away.
Private businesses and the wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching the customers in this way.
Massware is currently made much cheaper in the Asian room and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
Furthermore, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
That means sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry is also trying to point through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the sticky pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we are producing environmentally and socially tolerant".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger Outside Office of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in sticking and peaks.
To contradict competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is an excitement field between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think primarily economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied to keep a customer tribe.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small cuffs at some places.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Kruise was inspired: "I couldn't start with a traditional spot before."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an exhaustive process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plates and surroundings and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitz.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
You don't want to touch legends, but Disney's still hoping for a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not a new film, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl.
This is about the experience of Nanny with the family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the movie.
Xi urges to open the economy broader for the world
The economy needs to open itself more widely outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group commissioned to govern the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business foundations strategies," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will bring about new vitality and new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The Governing Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of State holdings (SOE), private capital, and recovery of the inhabitants' communication system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market, guarantees a legal-state business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relieve controls of the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
The statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open governmentally controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide them with better services," stated the Statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee the lawyers to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the level of mercury in robbery fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large robbery fish and thus add a significantly higher dose of nervous gift to consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU workpaper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and adverse effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full growth to pregnant and infants," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt suggests that the limits of the nervous gift for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish for "economic reasons" should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilograms of fish.
However, large robbery fish are already so busy with mercury that, on the basis of the existing limits, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubled the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be inappropriate.
In contrast to this reduction, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to reinforce the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick" because smaller peacefish, such as carps, are usually so lowly loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore a "perfide distraction manoeuvre that helps the economy alone", said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilver is a high-toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in robbery fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "almost small quantities can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard of the general population" cannot be expected.
Quecksilver comes to the environment mainly by combustion of coal.
According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants have delivered more than six tonnes of mercury per year to Annalena Baerbock, two-thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "continuously and surfacely exceeded," the "spiegel" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, EU-wide warnings against mercury in fish already included among the most frequently reported health risks in the RASFF EU warning system.
