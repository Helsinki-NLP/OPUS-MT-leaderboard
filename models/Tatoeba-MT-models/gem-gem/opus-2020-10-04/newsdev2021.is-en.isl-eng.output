Biden conducts examinations in three key kingdoms
When there are only 100 days of elections, Joe Biden, an offering democrat, will take the forefront of three important swivel kingdoms.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is reported with 51% follow-up versus 46% of the president's follow-up.
In Arizona, the state is 49% – 45% Biden is willing and in Michigan is going to the superior victory of Biden, leading with 12 points, 52% – 40%.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these countries, and actually more.
Trump is living in these days with a chronic virus age that nationals are increasingly teaching him and tells the majority of questioned nationals have reacted badly, or very absurd at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has provoked absurd resistance from protests and disturbances that sprayed up at George Floyd’s death.
Trump and his government believe that they have reacted badly or wrongly.
In order to chronize Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism for ordering federal police to break back protests in cities where city or government leaders are Democrats.
It has created a tremendous wolf among the city’s inhabitants, and that anger has been contaminated to other Americans.
Pictures of federal police to push Protestants into unlabeled cars have not helped the United States case.
Watched the Lincoln Project's advertising precise attention to this, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three countries in 2016, but with very little vote.
Trump actually won many countries with little votes and won the votes by a minority.
For example, Michigan won with only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% inhabitants.
Almost all the surveys that political reporters say significant are showing the same conclusion, Biden is taken out.
A new CNN study in Arizona shows that Biden’s forehead has now come out of the shake limits of the survey.
The same is the case with the CNN and the Quinnipiac University of Florida.
In fact, even Fox News, who declared the support of Trump 2016, have published the same material in their media.
The President’s last hope, according to the questionnaires, is that Trump could hope to re-establish important places in the environment if attention is focused on the economic situation.
The economy of the United States took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 epidemic, but choosers do not seem to link the economic seizures to the chronic virus age.
In fact, the majority of the choosers seem to blame Trump for having reacted badly to the chronic virus age, but trust him better to deal with the economic accident that happens at this time in the state.
However, Trump has failed to run the debate in the election fight.
Following the oppositions that have almost continuously flog up from the news, the video made a frightening result, where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to control the discussion of the law and the importance of it.
Law and Order, became his significance words.
Now it seems to have failed completely, as said earlier.
As the examinations increase Trump, more and more reputations are likely to divorce Trump and describe support for either Biden, or any other, which is then Biden without mentioning it specifically on the name.
This is because in the United States, they choose in many elections on the same code.
Thus, choosing can simply mark the other class in the preset part of the electoral note, and allow it to be valid as a vote for all the other suppliers of its class on the code.
Thus, the representatives of the Republican Group in other offices try to quit Trump’s closure and achieve independent success in the elections.
The Olympics of Youth in Dakar Posted to 2026
The Olympics of Adolescence were to take place in Dakar next year, which has now been deferred to 2026 because of the chronic era after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed on it.
However, the release of the first Olympics to be carried out in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.

"No one went out of this"
I am welcomed in Baltasar’s and Christian Samper’s home in Copavog.
The reason for my visit is the new show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1, in the Load of Little-Kambi in the snowfallnese.
This is the first time that the fathers show together.
I am led down to Baltasar’s laboratory, where great painting is looking at me.
Huge and disgusting pictures of chickens in the past, but also of flying creatures; an eagle on one, birds on the other.
The workshop is distributed to the home.
“ We had a horse here with us who weed the grass, ” says Baltasar to me.
“The horse works much better than a laptop on this hole and the hills we have. ”
Mireya is with us Kristen and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works do well with the works here.
“Institutes, mixtures of paperworks and sculptures.
They're all very white and in contrast with what Dad is doing, because I'm working with the light and so,' she says.
“ It’s a year since that idea came up.
Then there were certain jobs that I was working for, and I wanted to show them, but they were attached to Tokyo by Covid.
When my dad started painting and I saw where he was going, I thought about my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong baptism in English legends about female cows and waters.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the boys, I felt the ideal thing to do with them, ” says Mireya, but she works with the winner No Bear Son of Gold in the Sign store.
"Then I'm making the insertion from the decoration."
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy of Snowfellsnesi, including the Little Kambi Load, and found the building fantastic.
“ This is a new space, an old load that has just been made up, ” says Mireya, who there talked to Baldavian Sverris daughter artist, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and attended the Barcelona List School before he traveled world travel to study art collections and research.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He came back here shortly later, met his wife, Christ, and has lived here for 57 years since 1963.
Baltasar, a powerful artist, has held a lot of private shows, and shows with Christ in many places.
He is the most known for his large wall pictures, namely a wall decoration in the Flethean Church and a fresco in the Vitstate Church.
“ What affects what I do is bitter that Iceland has and nowhere else, ” says Baltasar.
“ These low sunshines and those shadows stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, "Wow, here's a job to be done."
Mireya is the oldest children of Kristjön and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to become a artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to a size and a physics course in high school and did everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
She has, like her father, shown around the world.
A lot in Japan, to make up.
All the children of Baltasar and the Christian have been walking on the artistic path.
"I call this virus," says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Icelandair's counts have been in a grey area when pilots were dismissed
The Social Minister believes that Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company quit all airlines in the middle of a nuclear rivalry.
Then he claims that laws that meant firefighters to enter a apartment house are being taken into consideration for the burning of the Brothers City Road.
On July 17th, Icelandair was advised to quit all the 38 airlines who were working with the company while the airline’s kernel was still on the table of the State Contracting Officers.
The Department of Conceptions had the possibility of taking Icelandair into account this dispute and was prepared to resolve the matter for the Court of Justice.
To this end, however, flight maids and Icelandair gathered together more than a day after the discounts.
On the other hand, a social minister, Ásmundur Einar Dadason, says that in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right payer.
“ My view is that this is a certain right to defend payers.
When you're in conversation, when you're in the house of a saddler, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear in my mind that this would not have survived.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into a grey area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
He will not speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“I also see a dangerous discussion now that it is only normal to start to stabbing this system to reduce this right, so I am totally opposed. ”
This morning, at the explosion, Ásmundur was also asked about the reaction of governments to the burn at a brother - city road at the end of June, where three deaths died.
A councillor now explains the case on the basis of a Household and a Human Institute to which he directed his recommendations.
“ Today’s law does not allow firefire to enter a apartment house.
I have asked the Housework and Human Working Agency to consider specifically whether there is a reason to make any legal change.
I'm ready to present the legal changes needed to reduce the likes that can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
United States said increased pressure on the Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to the World on Sunday, the United States Government has made further efforts to force European companies to leave the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is conducted by Russia, which is a witness to people who are familiar with the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the United States of Energy have contacted European operators to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that in a “friendly ” tone, the Americans stressed that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from being a reality.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one triangle to the German media.
These threats are in line with the report by Mike Pompeo, United States Foreign Minister, last week, warning that companies participating in the project would be best to “come out now” or have a risk of punishment according to 232 parts of the famous law Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy Gazprom, overseeing the development of the project, five European companies are involved in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the latter company said that the US's attempts to undermine “Important Interior Projects” would be a clear interference in the European Government.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Representative Congress agreed to change the laws of national security which are intended to expand the US penalty operations against companies participating in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2-gas station.
According to one of the transporters of the law television, the results can be directed to companies paying for or submitting ships, guarantees, shipbuilding, shipbuilding or connection service for such ships, as well as those offering a witness for North Stream 2.
Both European companies and official officials have repeated their disappearance in the US's efforts to divide from European energy issues by using punishments against North Stream 2, and some of them have even called upon Brussels to perform data operations.
Consultants in Moscow have also severely criticized the Washington operation and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, a presidential officer, Dmitrij Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan for the completion of the project if the Washington officials maintain the new punishment operations to stress.
Preparing further transport of public authorities to land
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Affairs intends to export more public institutions to the country in the next place.
In the autumn, the bulb area of the House and the Human Agency will be transferred north of the Sheep Kruk to the autumn of the Minister's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they intend not to move north.
Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said this morning in the Gulf of Explorence that it would be important for the rural area to be transferred there to official institutions.
Therefore, there is a great valuable creation that also has a variety.
“ It’s societally important, we’re trying to build up everything around the country.
Employment building, monetary structure, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some natural exploitation, and this kind of work as a public service they support very well for their construction,” says Ásmundur.
“Create increasing diversity, create better support for this resource utilization and the monetary creation of the nation. ”
Ásmund's decision to move the fireplace of the House and the Human Agency has been severely criticised by its employees and by the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters.
Six men who have specialist knowledge of burning and working in the branch are all resident in the capital area, and none of them intends to move lives to the Sheep’s Crown.
“ I think it’s quite clear that it’s politically distinct views of how hard this should be done.
My view is, and has always been, that we should take radikal action to better distribute public jobs," says Ásmundur.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, the Northern people, and Danir have done this with good success. ”
He is convinced that the majority of the nation wants to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of official work to land, as I was doing with the Housework and Human Agency.”
He illustrates the transfer of food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland’s landmeters to Akraness and Unemployment Insurance at the Skaga.
“ There is a workplace on the Skaga Coast today that is important to that society.
I think we should take further steps in this being."
“ I’m preparing further steps in this being.
More transfer."
In the fifth ten arrested in Seattle
A systematic racism and the decision of the President of the United States to send federal police forces to cities to disobey was protested yesterday.
In the fifteen ten Protestants, they were arrested in Seattle.
The police in Seattle used blossoms and pepper sprays in numerous protests last night, as the police described as disadvantaged.
21 policemen hurt, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months later, a protest age against systemic racism began in the United States after a policeman killed George Floyd.
The protests were blowed up to show Protestants in Portland’s consensus.
After the U.S. President sent to the U.S. Federal Polices who have driven on unlabeled cars, they have repeatedly had a serious conflict between police and Protestants.
Thousands of people gathered in Portland this weekend, using the police of tear - gases and rubber bullets when struggling between them and Protestants.

Your doctor ran 35 kilometers with a mask
The British physician Tom Lawton ran over the days of 35 km with a facial mask to demonstrate that oxygen saturation did not decrease during the use of face masks.
Lawton, a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital, has worked there while the world epidemic has crushed.
To reject the oxygen saturation theory and to encourage people to have a facial mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Before he started, he founded a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, who cares for food gifts in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all that keeps us safe.
That is why I have been shocked over wrong information that has interfered with humans that face masks reduce the oxygen saturation of people,” said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had been in a triple before, but while the world epidemics were at stake, he had tolerated a decline.
On Monday last day, he ran 35 miles [35 km].
“ I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation was exhausted 98% every time I looked, ” Lawton wrote at Twitter.

Godlieb warns that the unbreakable spread of the crown virus in society makes it 'very difficult' to open schools in the autumn
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Medicine Surveillance, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult” for schools to open new school years if the chronic virus spreads in these communities.
“ I believe that the school authorities in each place need to examine the distribution within the community.
If the virus is distributed uninhibited in society, it will be very difficult to open in that state," said Godlieb in “Face the Nation”.
Since autumn starts in the next weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools for students and to offer education in schools five days a week.
However, these experiments by President Trump and Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the chronic virus age would probably “exacerbate before he improves, ” and confirmed that schools at the places where the situation is worst may have to postpone school opening for a few weeks.
Yet, on Thursday, sickness warning centres issued instructions on how to open school for students the safest.
The instructions include that schools should be distinguished between people’s loyalty, students and employees, and that students are switched into separate groups to reduce infectious pathways.
However, the health centre did not give school managers a reference to when to close schools if chronic virus infections are increasing, as Godlieb says was “unhappy. ”
“ When this uncertainty is rich and precise, I do not think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“For this reason, I think it is very important to get accurate information about the precise standards that the Disease Warning Centre did not provide in their instructions. ”
Godlieb said that school areas must consider the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread and testing when decisions are made about whether to keep schools open or switch the alpha into Internet education.
If there is a positive conclusion between 5 and 10% of analyses, "the matter is going to be difficult" but over 10% is "the threshold when carefully considering whether to close schools."
“ This is the sign that the epidemic has reached its footing in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the Florence, which is the center of the chronic age in the United States, difficult to open for school education for the next month.
Coronary virus infections have increased to more than 30 countries and the Columbia region than the centre of the epidemic, which is located in the solar belt known as the south coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was evidence that the increase in cases had begun in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
Despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that there were “significant signs ” of the slowing of the epidemics in some countries of the sun belt, the “heating in the coals ” of others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indians, and Illinois.
Many governors have laid down rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped reopening destinations to detect the spread of the chronic virus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing stocks, limiting the number of people at restaurants, closing movie houses and other places offering entertainment and laying down rules on the use of masks to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that enable the countries to avoid taking back the narrow limitations set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
Besides, some countries have made the use of masks obliged various companies to make use of face protectors.
McDonald's sudden bitist is the latest company to make the use of face protectors obliged and thus added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on the use of masks.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking obligation, especially where the risk is considered to be great.
“If we really can control the epidemics when the winter goes until we get vaccines or any form of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something we can all do but that does not change our lives directly and allows us to keep what is very important for us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school, ” he says.
Although Donald Trump last week did not say that he wanted to make mask use in the whole country, he encouraged Americans last week to use face asses and said at the White House’s newspaper meeting that “their influence would be. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s a lot to expect. ”
Crystal Palace’s adherents received a message for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the company’s director, declared that the prosecutor, Miss Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
It has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be going, but it has previously been spoken by a team like Arsenal and Bayern München.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will reveal whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay for him some high sums, especially in the financial uncertainty hours of the sport this summer, after the period when Zaha insisted on four limits and made five supports for the Palace team which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the period, Hodgson said that “the news is to be expected” regarding the possible exit of Zaha after confirming that the attendant had“ made it clear ” that he would see his future elsewhere than with the company.
There are still three years left of the attendant’s contract at Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million sterling pounds would need to be done by the company.
At the end of the period, Hodgson ended with seven losses in a row and an equal on the last day of the period, which led to a fall in the 14th seat.
Zaha found the network masks only once from the middle of December until the end of the period with long losses against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get rid of the company, but there was no offer to try Palace to sell.
Zaha changed in January, that it seems to increase the chances of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks it will undoubtedly be a priority for him to ensure social change.
Zaha was the player who played most minutes in the English electoral department for Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team could be necessary to attack with the resources available for the player.
Fellibyl Hanna: The chronic-viral state of Texas faces a great risk of flooding in a “two skeleton”
The weather reporters have foretold “shore floods ” in the southern part of Texas after the turbulence Hanna reached two times in the country, resulting in large rains and winds up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as the first stage of storm (the lowest level of five levels) and has now been moved down to the tropical storm, but rain could still be around 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 metres per second.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first turbulent of the Atlantic Atlantic period in 2020, and the weatherologist Chris Birchfield advised the people to be careful: “This is not nearly finished yet; we still expect a flood of disaster. ”
Last weeks, Texas has had a great increase in chronic virus infections.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster announcement for 23 counties on the road of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All turbulences are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even more difficult, as the turbulence is going through a area that has become the worst because of COVID-19," said Greg.
It first arrived at 17:00 a.m. on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 210 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christ.
The second time was not far away, in the east part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Corpus Christ’s emergency service set up gardens near gates to use them if they flood across the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States said that the governments were watching Hanna and Douglas, who were moving towards Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm nearby had increased the anxiety she felt because of the world epidemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems related to chronic lung disease.
She said: “This is almost like a double trap for us.
I think many people have become weak.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong and standing together."
Heavy on a blossoming sailing in the South
In the South, the weather has been very good for farmers.
Most of them are finished with the first sleeve, a second sleeve is widely started, and then some are expected to reach the third sleeve at the end of summer.
The weather has played with sunny farmers like other inhabitants of the land in summer, and it has not corrupted the sprout on thin farmers.
So loudness has worked well.
The victory of the son of August, a cowboy in the Barbaric Hole, and a worktaker in the hay is satisfied and happy.
“Yes, it’s just gone wonderfully well, I think that farmers must just be broken, it’s been walking fine end of being very good weather last half month.
Hey, the very good end of the harvest is good and the quality of the huys fine over," says Victory.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in cowboys, that they are in flat grills or outdoors, which have been given very well, but it is far the best to do in the rolling.
“ It’s vital, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last half of the month or for three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and then it’s so comfortable to do so.
It remembers everything, it is less stress and can be stored for the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it is wonderfully comfortable.
But does Victory think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, those who were first.
We started on June 17, it might be that those who were the first had to take something three times."
Initial solution for the wolves - How to prevent the injury
The Candle Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is a hugely fast player.
His opposers have had it to take action to make sure that he will not pass away from them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall out several times, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, a patient could see something anointed on the shoulders of Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a writer in Wolves, but what was wearing was a child oil.
“ Making him a sleepper makes defenses harder to grip it, so we can prevent further injuries. ”
His shoulder of Traoré fell out of a team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the axes have fallen out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.

Stott, in his conversation with Sky News, said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not different from the articles of the gossip, the only difference was that the book was tied in.
The former soldier wants to see more and more to be directed to the positive part of their husband and wife, such as their charity work.
Stott said: “I think what is happening there in no other way than what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a built - in book. ”
“ There’s a historian who tells us, but there’s no doubt that this is from them. ”
“ I think this is just another attack on them, just like the gossips that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the scene light, and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish they were more concerned about all the good they have done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duke and of the Duke of Sussex shaded the other members of the kingly family, according to a expert in the history of the kingly family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the king’s family had failed to use the constellation of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for their sake.
She added that the rulership of the king’s family was firm, but that the interests of the public could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen was inclined to overcome other members of the king’s family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They are really popular."
“ They had less wedding than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“While Harry and Meghan’s wedding were smaller than Willhelm and Katrine, news was as much, because of the interest of the world’s population in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often looks after his records on Twitter, which are causing a struggle.
In a interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unrecognised republics on Twitter records – some of which contained materials from the white racer – would cause him the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he would look after his records, Trump replied: “Oft, too often.
It was like this in ancient times, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back next day and said, "Oh, how happy I am that I didn't send this," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start to get a phone call — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you're gonna find out differently."
In the last month, Trump caused great anger after re-exposure (disputed material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages region in Florida, where an elderly pair called "White power" or "Colour White".
And in 2017, Trump re-publiced three entries focused on Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, the leader of the right - right group of Britain First.
The President told Portnoy that the reappearances that had brought him into the worst trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and don’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what's on your helmet, which is a little, and you don’t grow it, sometimes – I’ve found out that it’s almost always the reappearance that causes you to be in trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation to himself, a voice of his opponents, and conspiracy teachings with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television shows and newspapers, which he says transcurred by falseness.
But the president’s lies have often understood, and now the Twitter records of Trump are misunderstanding.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries are working to develop different location techniques than the GPS system.
The engineer says that there might be reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewed in lifetime.
The GPS technology follows us at every footing.
We use it when flying, sailing, and driving, landing, industry, and leisure.
Most people think that it is a military device for the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1990 ’ s.
The GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite to a height of 20,000 kilometres above the earth, so natural conditions have little influence on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb it.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these marks," says Seemundur E. Thorsteinsson, a engineer at the University of Iceland and an expert on risk management and communication security.
He also says that it is easy to send error marks with the wrong location, for example in military.
“The GPS system is owned by the United States Defence Ministry.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very specialist president to let him do this, then he might probably do it," said Seemund.
Hence, many countries have started thinking of other systems and location techniques.
The Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is shaking Galileo's location system off the stocks.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
This may have been more precise and naturally under the European Union's Government.
Then there's not one government that is absolutely dominating it, but many," says Seemundur.
But many have also started looking back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the sixth decade and until the GPS technology took over.
The loran marks are sent on very long waves from shipped down to the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, represented by Enhanced Loran, people are seriously considering in many countries to have the system as a reserve, because it is a little different laws to disturb it, it is much harder than disturbing the satellite system, ” says Saemund.
However, most location systems are most likely to be accessible.
Testing Congressor Protection Buchanan died due to the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in his fingerprint and a virtue servant of the public,” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of many, and he was loved and glorified by those who knew him.
I will never forget how exciting he was, the sense of humor, and the joy he received by helping others."
Buchanans office published an announcement earlier in the month, where it appeared that Tibbetts had not had any recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who served outside the office, had served for Buchanan from 2011.
Florence has reported 414.511 cases since the beginning of the world epidemic, more than 41.200 in New York, according to the state health authorities.
Data from the state’s health authorities show that hospitalisation has increased by 79% since the National Festival Day of the United States, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 survival departments in Florida reached tolerance on Saturday.
“ We told them that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and remedy could have a negative effect. ”
A flight from Hornfield to Cape Town
The Turkish Dove, Rosaster, Circular Dove, Scalp Nebula, Glybrush, and Crystals are among the birds that have been complicated here in the summer.
On the web of birds in the Southeast, there are nearly daily short news about the birds, where they have been seen, and sometimes their sex.
They are many bird interesters in Iceland.
For this purpose, the number of those who like the Facebook page islandic bird species can be mentioned.
The members of the group are about 14600.
It is a sharing of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is dominated by good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
The son of Bryan is one of them.
It, as he is called, is an employee of the South Eastern and the South Eastern National Institute of Fuglity, and keeps a close watch of the bird life in that area.
He talks beautifully about these animals that enrich the realm of life in Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large robbery or a little bird.
In 2005, the Fulfiliate Institute was founded on the birthday of Half - Björn’s son in the Quescars in Ephesus with the aim of maintaining and continuing the significant natural studies he conducted since 1940.
“ Half - death was thirteen years old when he began to carry out information about birds, ” says Browsen River in a conversation with the Kern.
“ We at the bird research station are not doing exactly the same as the half - punk, but we are building on his data by counting and labelling birds. ”
Half - death was a farmer and a general scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and birds.
He died on February 10, 2017, nearly nine years old.
Half - killing and his brothers and sisters in the Quesques were interested in many of those who were familiar with them in the islandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gísli Arnarson, “the employee ” of the Fugl Thought Station.
A bear grew up in the Reynibergs of the Southern Army, and he had abundant natural peasants with his neighbors, a half - pond on the Quesques.
But what is it that the South Eastern bird - minding station does?
About March 20, each year, the Fugl - Thoughting Station sets up a special bird in the Isolation, a trenund dose within the Horn - feather Hawk.
There are standard labels for the birds that come into the nets.
The networks are taken down around May 10, when the warp time begins.
The networks are up every day, at least from about six o'clock in the morning and until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a presser asks in the forefront.
“ Yes, we share this with us, I and Blessing.
Because we have to work for ourselves now, this can be a lot of pussy, but somehow we can do this," says the Browsen River.
The networks are then set up again during August 1 to November 10, every day weather permits.
Between watching the nets and during the periods they are not alive, Browsen and Bears mark cries, shoes, and various birds where they reach them.
In addition, they take up various special tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in cooperation with the Icelandic Natural Institute and focuses on the collection of forests of birds.
“ The forestry is jumping on the birds in their winter stations and then going with them to the land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so when they arrive in Iceland, they are not big.
Then he jumps off the bird and seeks to find another hospital when he needs to keep it."
But there's plenty of rooms.
Asking how the birds in the Southeast are doing this summer, Brownwood says that the warp of the crise seems to work well — over the heads of it.
“The warp of the war is here at Hala, Southern Army, and it's all right.
On the other hand, there is no warp to find anymore at Jökulsarlon, where several years ago there was a huge warp."
He says that a few years ago, over a thousand crystals were thrown there, but now they can be counted on other hands.
“ When we look at mosquitoes and birds, I feel that the last few years have reduced what you feel about them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
What can explain this great change is probably about the supply of food.
"It's all about food."
In that case, human works can also be said about the offspring of birds and other animals.
But this summer, some birds seem to have it very good in Southeastern.
“ One of the positive things I feel is to get cold is to increase again after great lowness, ” says Browsen, “but during the past few years and decades, the shums have fallen very badly. ”
Of sparrows, it appears that the marijuana is going to walk well in its throw in some years, as it was last year.
Forest thrills and youths had decreased somewhat, but the Brownwood says it does not appear until the harvest of how this summer has been proved to them.
But let's turn to the complicators.
Often they raise great attention, especially if they are very foolish and even colorful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular complications in the summer: the rose star.
“ Others have been relatively calm in some of the complications, ” says the Brown River, but he says that the country is now finding a cry and then circular doves have been seen and are being thrown here.
When Browsen and Bears get ready for complications, they also mark them, as other birds do.
Significances are international, and they are being practiced worldwide.
The meanings, such as the bird’s winter stations, where they are throwing, and where they travel.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” says Browsen.
This information is useful in many ways, for example when it comes to epidemics such as bird breeds.
“ There is always growing knowledge. ”
If anybody in the world finds a bird marked by the South Eastern Fowledge Institute, the information is sent to the Icelandic Natural Institute.
“We have been recovered from the Cape Town of South Africa.
There we found a crawl that we had marked.
One crown from us was found later in the United States."
One of the birds is the bird of the Bryan River, and that is the shum.
“ The shoe is our bird, ” he says, “the bird’s bird’s birds, and its South Eastern Natural Institute, as a mission to observe his offspring — which has become quite slow, and now he’s on the list.
It is difficult to claim what caused a crash in the foundation, but one doctrine is that the foam has made a seahole that was previously swallowed by fishing boats to the sea good than that it is now going to be used much better and that it affects the foam.
Are you at the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ Of course, you don’t make me say no, ” says Browsen Laughing, adding: “Where we are also chasing birds, we must probably go further. ”
Yet, the Southeast is a special one when it comes to bird life.
“This area is like the land of Europe, but then the birds are spreading from here.
Being here looking at birds and birds is very interesting, but there is less of birds to find than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the feast and to the yoke, so that the area that such is well suited to look at the birds."
But is there a Bryan bird?
He thinks about it for a short time before he answers.
The question seems difficult.
“I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I now find one of the most fun taking pictures of horses.
So it's always fun to find birds that have not been seen in this country before or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But Binni and Bosse both have done that.
If you want to keep a closer look at the work of Binna and Bössa at the Southeastern Fowledge Observatory, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the web birds.is
Saedi-Arabia — the sunshine of the future? No alcohol or bikini
Travelling industry has grown enormously widely in recent years, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want their cookie.
The governments think to spend about $60,000 billion in the country to create a traveling paradise.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that is to be used to the Icelanders in southern Europe.
There will be no alcohol available, and women will not be allowed to sunk themselves in bikinium.
How, though, should travelers be locked to this strictly believed Islamic country?
For example, this should be done by building a new city with white beaches, moons (of course made of humans), drone - rail trucks, and robots who serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the prince of Saedi Arabia, who wants to put in this investment.
Of course, the money will be picked up in the land’s oils.
The prince says that there is no discussion that women can avoid covering the shoulders and knees on public places, but at the same time admit that it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot there when the sun is high and cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
However, it is possible to wonder whether it would also distract the interests of future tourists if they could not buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, which was formerly stuck by the Central African Presidency, announced a presidential procurement
On Saturday, the former President of the Central African People's Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been stuck from a chair, announced that he would offer himself in the presidentships in December, despite the action of the United Nations, and that a arrest order was issued because of his meant crime against mankind.
He announced his presentation in a speech before a large group of supporters in his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work ”), in Bangui’s capital.
This 73 - year - old former general and soldier were elected in 2013 in the revolt of a union to the largest Muslim Rebels from the north, who poured the nation, who is mostly a Christian, in a violent civil war and a serious and long - term human disorder.
“The country needs a person with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech that was criticized at the official time of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took over after a robbery in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before he escaped the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for mean crime against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but it has not been arrested since he returned from exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign penalty operations affect its offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to suspend the infringement operations that were set in 2014 for the purpose of supporting armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera runs the country today with the support of the United Nations' extensive peacecare, which numbers more than 13,000 soldiers and policemen.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for a second term, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has decreased but still occurs bloody events that are mostly due to conflicts about resources, but most of this demant country is not under government.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to escape their homes.
The state of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is “unacceptable for everyone,” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the center of Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale’s position in the Spanish team is “inappropriate to everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a little part in the LaLiga joy of Los Blancos, and now in summer it is up the vacation that the player intends to stay standing before and let his contract run out, but the company hopes that he will disappear.
“ There is no way to avoid the situation being unacceptable for everyone, ” said Kroos on the Lauschan attack Endlich, who was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" and so said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that.
When he was asked if the circumstances had a negative effect on Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as expected.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked something important together."
China gives Reykjanesby 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the chronic virus
Chinesian Senior, Jin Zhijian, delivered two thousand face masks for the past week.
On July 22, last year, the citizen’s mayor visited the Chinese ambassador.
The news was first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to reimburse the visit of the Chinese ambassador in Reykjane, where he visited the council and met the mayor.
Says Viktor News that there was a discussion about promoting friendship between the town of Reykjane and the city of Xianyang, but the community started their cooperation between 2014.
The gifts, 2,000 face masks, are due to this friendship, but the city authorities of Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the chronic virus age.
The news report reports that the masks are used in sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjane for both employees and other guests coming there.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, there is an inscription on the face mask box “Ber is one behind, except a brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculate to lower wages
Tobias Thomsen will try to get home to Danmark, from Iceland Master KR, for the next month, and claim to be interested by colleagues in the Danish 1rd department.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become an Icelandic champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old attendant says that he is missing Danmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stephen Jacob’s daughter.
The Danan Convention with KR applies to the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would need to reconcile with KR for a price to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would be waiting until winter to get to Danmark.
“ Yeah, I know that the Danish departments start again at the end of August.
Of course, that means that I had to break my contract with K-Gens, but I've told them I miss Danmarks, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer who had shown his full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not believe that the price would be a great problem.
“ I have also had a conversation with two branch associations after the branch was finished and I knew where they would end.
There has been a little interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Danish before the Icelandic department ends," said Thomsen but added that there was obviously not many partners in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been interesting.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said to look first to the Copenhagen.
Thomsen said K-king didn't have to worry about that he wouldn't give himself all in exercises and games, even though he missed Danmarks.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do the things 100 percent.
I can completely overlook because I miss Danmarks when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who clearly says that he will lower the wages of leaving the Icelandic Masters in the next Danmark department.
“ I’ll probably have to lower my wages only because of the crown virus crise, which seems to have scattered the Danish companions only more than those islandic.
But I am also studying, and one solution may be that a company has provided me with a job.
Most of the associates in Department 1 have agreements with qualifiers.
I'm learning sports management through the actors' organizations and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the start team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max department during this season, but has been recorded in five games and scored one mark.
He started 21 games before the team last year and set seven limits.
KR is equal to the points at the top of the Pepsi Max department and is playing for good, but the KA is coming to Akureyri today.
The crown virus on board in a bus when the driver gets into a hot fight about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers on board in the Arriva Street Cart in Liverpool.
The driver is heard to explain to a woman that it is not in his work ring to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It is not in my work ring to tell everyone who steps up in the car to use a mask. ”
A Witness said this about the event: “Man and an elder woman began to give her a dispute, and a lot of disputes broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was really going on, and he told one woman that she was not even using the mask correctly. ”
“The woman then went out of the car and said she was going to announce the event. ”
A spokesman of Arriva said: “Security of our clients and our employees are as soon as possible priorities.
“ Our clients are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply). ”
"Describes instructions and labelling for customers about this and all other remote rules are on board in roadways, on social media and on our sites."
Since June 15th, public transport has been in force.
Over 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been detected worldwide.

Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often
The playster is involved in a new struggle about the increased participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The action is ongoing at the same time as 30 years since the United States' laws on the rights of people with disabilities, which appear on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of seeing themselves and reflecting their lives in a realistic way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and real pictures, ” she says.
“ That is why it is so important to take appropriate actors into a proper role. ”
Spencer discussed the influence she experienced by seeing skin - dark people on the screen when she was a little girl looking at the “Good Times ” section.
These were made by Norman Lear at CBS between 1974 and 1979, and they rode the way as the first parts of the joke showing two parents who were both of African origin.
Cooperation against Hunger kicks Yoho aside after events in the Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization who wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked the Senator Ted Yoho to declare himself of the government of the constitutions, and that he had become so, as they called “attack ” on the Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Senator of New York, accused Yoho, Senator of the Republic of Florida, of using low - cowboy and male arrogant words when he corrected her when they met on the stairs of the Senior House last Monday.
Yoho argued that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the event confirmed that the word had been as she described it.
Bread for the World declared that the government of the organisations had met Yoho on Friday and sought for him to “justify our obligation to stand with women and skin - dark people, inland and in the world, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World website, their “common - Christian voice ” stresses the consensus and governments to bring an end to hunger in the country and in the world.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization with the goal of reducing hunger and poverty with trusted public policies, the organization keeps the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we deal with people in powers, wherever they are on the political pathway, ” says the Declaration.
“In our appreciation, the recent acts and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements made for our members. ”
In the process of the news, a speaker Yoho had not responded with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the Senatorial Chamber last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramaticly commented on the event and directed her words against what it called a male restraint that “accepts violence and a violent speech against women. ”
More than a tenth of her coworkers concluded that the event was an example of all too common manner behavior.
Yoho described the event as a short discussion of policy and said that “nobody had been anxious, disturbed, or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown “a tremendous interface. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in its first period as an advanced Senator and has received both praise and last for her cleanliness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative Senators of the Congress and will sit in a holy stone at the end of his fourth term.
Waiting for the 98th minute in the locals to test the first target of the period
Jesse Lingard had not inspected or invested in the English Division during this season, until he arose against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final journey of the department.
Lingard had not inspected the English electoral department since he had twice declared Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as a reserve for Manchester United today when the Leicester team was in a final game about the Championship Site.
When more than seven minutes were passed above the normal stage, Lingard hired the ball of Kasper Schmeichel, a targetman of Leicester, and scrutinized to an empty target.
Long-term target for Jesse Lingard.
Players Real Madrid Except Rules for Infectious Disease
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in Europe’s Master Department, without having to go for two weeks of disease.
British governments have decided that tourists from Spain have to go for two weeks of disease, in order to reduce the spread of the chronic virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of competition teams at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The board says that the individuals who are exempted from the rules will only be in certain areas, in front of close doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
Therefore, Madridingar can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2–1 below the entrance after losing Santiago Bernabea on February 26th.
The victory team will continue in the 8-leavened finals that take place in Portugal.
Rainfall and Lowering on the Land of Shopping Heliness
Of the news of overwhelming hotels and tent areas to judge, at least southern, is clear that Icelanders have been busy traveling in the country this summer.
If those who have landed underground have also been lucky with weather and weather weather providers DV in one case that the summer was just plainly proclaimed beautiful, here at least.
But now it feels like a merchant’s sanctuary, which has been the largest of the year’s travel sanctuaries.
Yet, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, but events that in the ordinary year have caused a large number of people to be not held.
That is enough to mention a national feast.
The weather will, of course, play a great role, but now it looks like rainfall throughout the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather office foretells rainfall from Thursday evening to Saturday evening.
For example, long - term predictions are not a sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean and can naturally change.
The weatherologist knocked Einar Sween Bear’s son, in his prophecy on his weather tissue, Bliku, says that it is delighted to expect the sacrificial sanctuary.
Says he: Lower tracts in the lofts with the corresponding cold that too often reaches down to the surface, resulting in that when warm air from the southwest is trying to approach only low with wind and departure.
Surely, also warmer air that “firms ” here north.
One publishes a prophecy card to support it, saying: “A small wave from America is fighting to the east and with it a summerly air.
As she approaches, she becomes “blombered ” in the form of lowering air pressure and considerable summer levels. ”
The large forecast, the European calculator on the left on the map, and the American GFS on the right are somewhat concurrent with this development.
The distinction of the lowness goes over the prophecy late on Thursday and early on Friday with a rainy A, and mostly all of the country.
The lower centre of 985 hPa will then follow.
At this time, some warm air comes in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it could blow up.
A man has been severely damaged is a car with cattle selected in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.

Following a playster from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot into her as if you were getting such a youth shot,” says Birna Hrann Björn daughter about Marisku Hargitay, the main playster of the parts of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so caught by the actress that she arrived at the recording site of the parts and waited for her for hours, just to be able to say hello.
When Birna Hrönn Björn’s daughter, the owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Office, looked like many Icelanders at the excitement factors Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the centuries, she was a collar for the chief player of the Marisku Hargitay.
Birna tells us the story of her meetings and her actress in the section Love Stories at Council 1.
When Birna was a teenager, at the age of which many begin to develop a paralyzed love shot, she did not feel like her peers because she was in a hard position to suppress her own feelings.
She felt interested in boys’ bands and young chaffic cardiostics from movies, but she did not.
“ I was cutting out pops and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it; it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that at times, when people get out of the closet, they go through a late barbecue.
“ We spend our adolescent years depressing these teenage vessels, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her shoe."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran on the snow.
One of her best friends, Erling Frighten Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in the city and brought Birna and their friend, Gunnar Holy Son of God, to help with the tapes.
“ We were working in 30 bands of music and spending pleasant time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend such a long time a day so it was spoken of everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great marijuana fan.
One woman in the video team says her friend is familiar with the actress because he was in the band.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like working with her actress and whether Birna can meet her.
“ She tells me to stop this, she doesn't know if she can let it happen, ” says Birna.
When the movie is finally finished, the group will, and Birna, last time, try to convince the woman to try to come around the meeting.
“ She had already got some glasses and said she would just get it. ”
A few days later, Birna sent the woman a message and asked if there is something in the matter.
The woman does not answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she will wake up with a long - term message.
“ I look at the phone and cry over myself.
Gunnar Holy wake up at the shout, and I say, I have to shower, and I have to make myself fine, and go down to town.
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the law and order team were present at a hotel at Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, do you good, ” says the messages, and Birna dresses herself fast, and she asks the reception where to go and take the elevator up to the 45th elevator where the group is gathered together.
Birna comes and waits until a woman of the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“ I said I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here. ”
When the friend finally comes, he looks overwhelmed at Birna and asks how she came all the way to the seat.
Birna explains that she was just taking the elevator and praying for seeing Marisku.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna are screwed.
Besides her, an extra actress sits in the parts, and they begin to talk.
“ I say to him, I am a fan, but you?” says Birna.
“ I played this as the most normal thing in the world. ”
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The players regularly appear when a break is taken, they get talk, and Birna looks around and looks for Marisku, nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he's leaving.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee, and she did not think she should go immediately.
As a wonder, the friend accepts it and reaches another person.
“ He comes with his second friend and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to see Marisku. ’ ”
Then he's going.
Finally, in two hours, the new friend will run to Birna.
“ He says, Hurry.
These are unusual situations today, there are newspapers with her so she won't stop anything.
She's going the best way to the car with them, so you'll have to take the chance and go down and find her bike.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose my face," Birna heads off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she feels about forty wheelhouses, some marked and some not.
However, Marisku’s bicycle hut does not find her, and then it becomes desperate.
“ I feel that the blow was pouring over me because I had spent half a day on this, but think so, I tried.
It was fun."
Hopefully, Birna goes back to the hotel, where she sees through the window the video team watching herself with pity eyes, as she realizes that Birna did not succeed in her projection.
Bears accept fate, and it starts raining.
“ I go under a cover to cover myself for the rain.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
No other than Mariska Hargitay was in the pants that she dressed in the parts, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly be moved by mental shock.
“ I look at the body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
The bears do so, and they make up to pee in the shoulder of the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'm just greeting and saying hello," Birna recalls.
“ I say I am from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "Good to meet you."
The conversation wasn’t much longer as Marisku’s car arrived, and it’s overwhelmed.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna greetes the god of faith, watchs the car drive away, and then breaks.
“ I call Erling and Gunna challengingly, and they thought that this wouldn’t have succeeded.
But I was crying of excitement and joy.
I say, yes, I'll meet her. You have to meet me now.
Then we swallowed into soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this one time in life, spending such time and energy in doing so.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Birna Rohn Bears daughter in the feature Love Stories at Ras 1.
Police does not spread the virus
There is no reason to worry about the fact that the chronic virus can be used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area says in a conversation with M.S.I.
Indications have been received from people who are worried that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police take care of, travel on the road, and let all who are on the door.
However, the police say the best of hygiene.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” says a policeman, “but we recommend a cup of cups that people blow in. ”
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few tens of cents. ”
Asked if it seems sufficiently distance, a policeman says so.
If it seems positive, the police will then use another measurement.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal disorders: Among other things, can be used to reduce pain
The connections to depression are not coincidence.
Persons suffering from renal inflammation, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, themes, windgang, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of the symptoms of anxiety and depression of the United States (ADAA).
“ This is because it is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the theme does not decrease, food intolerance may be discussed.
Judge tries to stop the decision that children be released
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee cancelled the expected time limit by saying that immigrants and toll authorities in the United States do not have to release children if they cannot be done with any of the three ways described in the previous order.
However, it also stressed the obligation of immigrant and tolerance authorities to release their children without unnecessary delay.
The three ways that Gee suggested are to release families held by immigrants and toll authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families to the national court.
Shalyn Fluharty, head of the Proyecto Dilley Agency, who gives families legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the immigrant and toll authorities to decide whether they should continue to have children.
“The most important thing I feel is that children are kept in prison in an early time and they are not released unless the immigrant and tolerance authorities accept it or families agree to be broken,” said Fluharty.
Familys are held at three locations of immigrants and toll authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South-Texas (Dilley) and the Texas County of Karnes.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years old according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in Maintenance, said in June that as “the rules on the use of masks and social distance would not or would not be followed, ” it would be urgent to transfer children from these offices.
969 people in surveillance in the migrant and tolerant authorities have been detected with the chronic virus and are in isolation or surveillance from 23 July, according to the migrant and tolerant authorities.
There are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the maintenance centres for families.
A total of more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in maintaining
Will examine the regulation on the independence of the rulers
A presidency minister does not say unusual that life - listening treasures set their investment policy on the rights of workers.
The CSD’s comments on ensuring the independence of governors, possibly by law, will be taken into account.
Following Icelandair's interviews with the Icelandic Aviation Society, the Government of the VR declared that VR's managers who ordered to govern the Lieutenants' Lieutenants were neglected or voted against the participation of the Lieutenant's Ears in the expected Icelandair partial mission.
Ragnar Dor Ingolf’s son, President of VR, then said that governments would be replaced if they did not respond.
Ragnar Thor pulled his statement back three days later, as well as VR.
Asgeir Johansson, bankruptcy director of the bank bank, reported on Friday in the news of RUV that the independence of governments would need to be guaranteed in the agreements of the funds and possibly with legal change.
Catherine Jacob’s daughter, a presidency minister, says importantly that the rulers of life’s treasures are independent, but it is already considered legally secured.
“ Now, the bank bank manager, who of course has the financial supervision that has to do with this, has said that it is necessary to consider the regulatory work around this independence specifically, of course we will consider it if something needs to go over there, ” she says.
Katrin says that laws should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It would be desirable to discuss the social and moral standards that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“ I thought nothing unusual likewise that life - listening treasures also set out in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I believe that such decisions are taken through policy, not through special investment decisions,” says Katrin.
“Intolerant traffic matches at the Elfenbein bridge,” says the President of the City Government
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the city government of Årburg, says a cartridge, which forms at the Alfus Bridge at Selfossi every day completely intolerant.
He hopes that a new bridge over Elfsaw will go to the autumn.
Now that the Icelanders travel through their land and travel on the roads of the country, they create daily traffic paces at the Elfenbein Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the city community.
Long rows form at edges and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally intolerable, it’s one traffic carpet here and not just on Fridays, because this is just the word in the active days too.
There are long baths, sometimes quite up on a hellish oath for those who want to pass here on their way east to land and those who are coming to the west, so that it gives an eye the way we need to have a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the city government in Aarborg.
Helicopter says that the city authorities of Árborg recently met with the Chairman of the Vegetation and the designer of the Vega, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about working in these matters, I think I can say that now because it’s really working on this, and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited into the harvest. ”
But is there any counsel to the drivers who are in the queue at the bridge of the river all the days of the summer?
“Yes, that the narrows can go through the ears, but those who are going eastward, they cannot be pointed out to go to the Heaven of Lungary, but those who are going to the revelations should use Mosfellsheheath, hedge and gravel.”
Helicopter S. Haraldsson, President of the city government of Arburg, says the traffic circuit, which is formed at the Elfenbein bridge at Selfoss intolerantly.
Long baths develop each day at the Elfenbein Bridge and often drivers need to wait for a lot of time to cross the edges.
Then the only advice is to breathe deeply and to think something positive.
The future of coal bears in the north of Brisbane takes place for organization
Civil government noted that, in addition to the area, the vital home of coal bears, squirrels, and grey sharks, it would be an important link between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek Natural Areas.
Commissioners have invoked the rejection of urban governments to the Court of Justice of Organization and the Environment, arguing that the building is in accordance with the civil organisation laws from 2014, would satisfy organisational and social needs that have not been satisfied for this purpose and “may be done without any unacceptable effect”.
There is great opposition to these planned activities in the nearest environment.
The operators argue that, despite being fully in harmony with the organization, it could be changed if it did not meet requirements rather than reject it.
As it includes many stages, including service stations, childcare, and 39 housing houses.
Public transmissions were more than 120 at the consultation period, and most protested, as it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
A minority leader in Brisbane stated that the city would have to buy the country to protect the coal monkey.
“ [The CEO] Adrian Schriner has to stop wasting taxpayers in the fight with judiciary operators and buying this country to protect the nature and animal life of Brisbane,” said Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes of coal bears in the mountain to Mangroves, where there are many coal bears. ”
Schriner said this week that the city government wanted the home of coal bears in the area to be protected.
“We didn’t find the suit suitable for the area, ” said Schriner.
“I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will keep the home. ”
Schriner said that maping in the home of coal bears is the common responsibility of urban government and government, but that the government is responsible for exact maps of the home of coal bears supported by local authorities when they make applications for executions for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, trainer Man Utd, was hoping that the team had secured a third seat in the English Division today.
The team will therefore play in the European Master Department in the next period.
United needed an equal or victory against Leicester today and was the conclusion of the 2-0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ It’s a great success for the players to reach a third seat, according to how the situation has been during the period.
I think we boys could have overcome a spiritual belt by working such a great game, because we have lost twice in the finals of this period.
We knew we needed a decision today, now we can have the next chapter that is in these boys to work titles," said Solskjær victory.
Manchester United still has the possibility of working titles during this period, but it is in the European Department in August and is almost at the end of 8th.
Weapon break starts at midnight in the warful Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — the Ukrainian Army and the Resistance forces in the eastern part of Ukraine are now preparing “a complete ” army break that will begin at midnight and as representatives hopes to be the first step towards peace after six years of war.
On Sunday, resistance representatives said that they had given their soldiers orders for a break of weapons and had issued a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said to his army have “prepared ” for the rest of the army.
If it was achieved, it would “pay the way for the implementation of other regulations” of the Minsk Peace Association, according to the Declaration by the President-in-Office of Ukraine earlier this week, where the arms break was called a time-to-date step.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 by means of France and Germany, was to resolve the conflicts between Ukraine and the distinctive people enjoying Russia, which began in 2014 following Russia's membership of the Crimea and the support of the country for separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fights.
On Sunday, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine rejoiced at both arms breaks and stressed the importance of reaching the agreement at the meeting in Paris in December.
President Vladimír Putin, Russian President, expressed concern over the call for Kiev that the Minks Convention was revised and said that the position of Volodimir Selenskij, President of Ukraine, on the “invariability of the Minsk Assembly, which he has reappeared in this call, should be reflected in real operations”.
On the other hand, Selenski stressed the need to take “frequenter actions ” to deliver the Ukrainians captured by rebels in Eastern Ukraine, on the embodied Crimskaga and in Russia, according to an explanation from the president’s office.
According to the 2015 Agreement, Ukraine can only be given authority over borders with Russia in the areas of separation that are dominated by separation when they have been given widespread autonomy and when elections have been held in the areas.
The assembly reduced conflicts, but the Ukrainian army and the rebels have continued to be divided.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for further discussions, support was given to the Minsk Agreement and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selenskij, who worked the elections in 2019 with promises of ending the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have authority over the borders for the first regional elections, but the Government of Kreml demands that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new arms break-up agreement was reached on Wednesday for the support of a three-party cooperation group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine and the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore rejoiced by the EU officials.
At the conventional Sunday blessings of Peter Storg, Pope Frans also mentioned the restoration of the weapons, saying that “the rebuilding of confidence and laying the foundation for the very necessary and long - term reconciliation with the people would be necessary. ”

Marksupe in the first victory of Blits in July
A broad moment won its first branch victory from June 29, when the IA went to the ground, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max Men at the Copagon Field tonight.
Forests, on the other hand, lose their third game in a row in the branch.
After winning his first three games in the department, the Brea Moment played five games without celebrating the victory and had suffered three in a row for the game with IA tonight.
It was, therefore, that it was for Blika who came into the game with great strength.
Alexander Helgi Sigurdard’s son led the team with a fine payment in the 11th minute after the Christian son of Steindor sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, then, the Christian doubled the leadership after a very pleasant preparation of Gissla the Son of Eyes from the left.
In the first half of the game, scumbers did not reach lands or coasts, where high - pressure inhabitants made them terrible to connect shipments together.
In a minute of 36, the Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen swallowed the Hornspit of the Gunnlaugh’s son, the third mark was cut into the field with all the powers.
Then Christ’s son of Steindor scourged his second goal and fourth goal of Blikka only three minutes later.
However, the history of the first half game did not end there.
Forests had a hope for the second when Haraldsson’s Trust of Hr. Haraldsson had scouted a crisp shortly before the playtime, then Kwame Quee had broken vibrantly on Viktor John’s son’s inside the flash.
Therefore, 4–1 was the state of the Breit Moment when the half-game fluid defected.
Only three minutes had passed in the second half of the game when the Scaggamen were scoring back.
The delightful Son of Sevar, then, was unauthorized and unauthorized on a marked Flash and easily controlled the ball in the net after the Horn Sphere of Mr. Harald’s son’s Trust.
On the other hand, only three minutes later, when he broke at Alexander Helga, a gentle one became violent within the IA.
The contest was sentenced and Thomas Mikkelsen insisted on safety to transfer the Breit Moment 5-2 when only seven minutes had passed from the second half game.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's target, the Shagagemen were scrutinized again.
Anton Ari Einarson, a target guard of the Blits, encountered pressure from Viktor John’s son, giving the ball to the foot of Viktors where the ball rejected the net.
Incredible 5-3 situations were seen when less than ten minutes had passed from the second half game, which slowed down the target scoring subsequently.
Despite the fine moves of both joints to add limits, including two deadlines of Kwame Quee from the Breit Moment, they did not become more and 5-3 victories of the broad moment of the game.
Thus, from June 29, a moment of its first victory worked for the first month, and after the victory has passed with 14 points in the third seat, two points from the Upper Val, three from the top of KR.
However, KR and Valu have both games inside Blits.
IA needs to accept the third loss in a row in the branch, but it has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the fall.
The Hungary Army is not at risk despite the White House’s statements
Yesterday, the producers of the Hvalpass Army did not stand to stop showing the child’s substance in the near future.
Following this statement, Kayleigh McEnany, a media representative of the White House, recalls that the features of lawguard dogs are victims of “exclusion cultures”.
The Canadian manufacturers of the factors quickly responded to McEnany’s words and said that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Hungary.
A number of television series of police activities have been taken out of the exhibition in the United States as a result of a protest age against police violence.
However, the puppets are not included, despite the fact that they have the reputation of their material on social media.
At a newspaper meeting in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump of the United States was the counterfeit of “exclusion ” culture, especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to the fact that statements or actions made by individuals or companies emerge hardly on social media and is called after the party is dismissed in protest.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw that the shows in the Hvalpass Army, a childhood subject to cops, were stopped.
Likewise, the features of Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toys manufacturer Lego took off the sale of lawyers, but there is no foot for that claim, according to the defense officers of Lego.
However, it is true that the reality factors of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the show in the West Sea.
Both participants are controversial for showing films of real police missions without the permission of individuals that appear there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspiciousness arise
Christian Tomas ’ daughter, a family doctor, answers questions about the family, children, and love in the DV family corner.
At this time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, we have been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel well, but both of us have felt like we were missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in connection with whether the other party is looking around, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a marble that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question and I am glad you have such an open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this in each corner, couldn't discuss this and even take any steps you could so later regret.
Everything on board, isn't it always the best?
The strong self - esteem is the most predictable for happiness in the future and the stronger your self - esteem, the more likely you will have a strong self - esteem.
The reasons that relationships that start in adolescents are not always lifelong, are often because people develop in each direction, but in those cases where the effects will be effective, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop in your greatest formation years, it can be concluded that you have developed together and have a positive influence on each other’s self - mind.
In particular, we are molded by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is shaped by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relations form who we are.
Could you turn the example back and think, ‘ What do we have as others do not have? ’
What does this many years of speciality give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be much more than the defects.
You have forgotten each other for years, and for this reason, you can say that you are specially different from one another.
That's more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You speak of the experience that you have missed something, but it is important to remember that big changes such as divorce and new relationships are also accompanying accompanyers that you are not necessarily excited to.
You may lose from restarting, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and setting up families.
These include new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this does not just follow a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a disgusting job, which may never be so well as you have already done to each other.
Is that worth it?
Would it not also be advisable to set your focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictability, and newness in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on your hill.
There's so much you can do to make this long relationship deeper and deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate that you have never done before?
Maybe you need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is considerably more tolerance to various forms of relationship, and pairs are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multi-loving, or decide to quit temporarily together.
I'm not telling you what you're supposed to do, even if no specialist in your solutions, but maybe it would lighten this heavy moisture that waves over you, if you look at this and think about solutions.
So what do you need to be untrusted and your fears disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean you're able to do things together.
Use it as strength and hold your hands towards your solution.
We invite readers to send questions and their vanity to Kristin by email at: hojonabandsalela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family Horn, of course unnamed and fully confident.

Coleen Rooney advocate Johnny Depp at the "Wagatha Christie" Rum at Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself from the accusations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the mates of footballers, their friends expected a dramatic breakdown
Coleen Rooney has advised the star lawyer to defend Johnny Depp in his so - called “Wagatha Christie ” law dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney had ordered David Sherborne to defend himself from the accusations that she had injured Vardy, claiming that personal information was leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.

Bidens cosmetic team refuses "Fox News Sunday" for an interview one week after a interview with Chris Wallace with Trump
In a interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump of the United States doubted that the expected president-promoting Democrate, Joe Biden, would handle the questionnaire that Wallace had fallen upon Trump.
We may never get a answer to that question — at least not at the moment.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audiences that Bidens' election team had told Fox News that he was “not free” at the interview.
“In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the group of Democrats, Joe Biden, would plow himself in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“In the week, we asked the Bidens election team for a interview, and they said that the former vice-president was not free. ”
“ We continue to ask each week, ” he added.
Trump’s cosmetic team has criticized Biden for months in order to avoid election meetings and newspaper meetings while he is attending interviews during the chronic virus age.
Though Biden has recently restarted his election trip, Trump and his companions have continued to haunt the former Vice - President for “hielding” in their home in Delaware.
However, Biden’s tense to attend public events has not enjoyed his offer, since the latest tests show that Biden has a good lead to Trump both in the country and in major struggles.
Mean Real Clear Politics indicates that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
In 2016, Trump worked in all the countries, when he turned them to the Republican group when he worked the battle of the White House.
In the latest research Fox News Poll, Biden has a headquarters in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
Research also suggests that Biden has a little lead in Ohio, Northern Carolina, and Arizona, three other important fighters in these elections.
And research suggests that governments who were formerly trusted in the cities of Republic, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trumps and the former vicepresident.
President-in-Office of the White House is often a vote on the President – and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and the economy that is lowered due to the epidemics – and the President’s performance and history in both languages.
Kanye West and his struggle with psychopathy
The musician Kanye West today apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for the comments he made in a violent case.
The President of the Psychology believes that he seeks his creative power, but a psychiatrist says importantly that people take medicines to keep the disease under control.
The Rapper Kanye West is not only one of the first and most powerful musicians in the contemporary world, but he is also as famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been much ahead of open tents.
It made great attention when he announced earlier this month that he was offering himself to a president in the United States, and he held a emotionally depressed and distinguished speech.
Later, some of them appeared uniquely on Twitter, who claimed that his wife was trying to put him into a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published an announcement at Instagram, as she asked people to show their husband and family understanding; he had psychiatric disease, and it would be difficult for his loved one to help him if he did not seek his own help.
He has since been apologizing to her publicly.
This famous family is not the only one to deal with this problem.
It is estimated that one percent of people gets a psychopathy.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a superphysician at a London Hospital, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause such disturbances for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This loudness, or mania, can destroy relationships and work and cause a disastrous grief.
And then the other sides, the depression, it is often very dangerous, for it is a high frequency of suicide in that group.
So I loved it that she was saying this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Today, Mr. Unnsteinsson, President of Geisthelper, has himself had a psychopathy — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very pleasant imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly contrabass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harps.
And he is so profoundly creative, promptly powerful, and clever in his powerful connection thought, because a man becomes with this connection thought that we have had to try to go into a violent state knows so well."
Canye West doesn't want to take psychotics, because he thinks they're reducing his creative gift.
He has discussed the psychos, including the record Ye.
Today, he says it is his choice not to take medicine.
“ Many feel that this creative element, which is part of this unfamiliar interconnection and the violent creative power of the fire that it has, is, of course, the defects of it are often great suffering, and the centuries and dark basements and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says importantly that psychiatric patients are treated.
“ If you have a lot of loudness or mania, you don’t make any great things, you just on the side.
And like when people get into serious depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Definitely, ” says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance between the best help of the medicines, and to destroy what is remembered for him and his capabilities and his creative power. ”

"Sickness" a ambassador wants a gun, a truck, and a pile-wester - said subdividors are a "deep-rich" arrival
A politically appointed Ambassador of the United States here in the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, said he wants to carry weapons in CBS news today.
Starting with the CBS report: “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “prosistent ” about his security since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
CBS refers to 12 diplomats, controllers and former representatives, as well as individuals who are familiar with the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they wished permission for the ambassador to walk around armed here in the country.
He should also have asked for a truck that traveled between Iceland and the West of the injection.
The U.S. Ministry refused to express whether some kind of threat was a threat to the security of the ambassador, but the representatives of the U.S. governments stated that the ambassador was expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, CBS says, lifeguards would have been advertised in Icelandic newspapers, and if it would be done to meet the requirements of the ambassador.
CBS reports that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to express itself on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. news office has according to its sources here in the country that no desire has been made to the local governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking armed as it would injure the host country, Iceland.
The chairman received his dignity for abundant support for Donald Trump's elections in 2016.
Before he was a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter accepted in May, he said that he has created a “impossible” environment in the ambassador, and has already had seven subdiplomas, known as Deputy Chief of Mission, understood by the ambassadors who are also dispatched by diplomats.
It was all proven by the American Foreign Ministry.
The first one was sent away by the messenger “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
He had already been preparing for a year and had learned English.
The next one only lasted for six months.
As a result, a rotation of staff was created, and it was the thought of allowing Gunter as most until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter expected the ambassador’s staff to take the “deep ” assignment and to undermine him to the Foreign Ministry in Washington, D.C.
The Heads of the Federal Foreign Ministry of D.C. are well conscious of the situation in their ambassador in Reykjavík, but have been hesitating to take into action the control of the ambassador's uncontrollment in the light of Gunters' connection with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulties in following the orders of the Foreign Ministry in Washington, and he was said he refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his servants for months.
When he was told he was going to work from his home in California unless he was appointed by the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Flip backwards
The owner finally received the order, Gunter turning back to Iceland in May.
His new substitute, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not been answered to their requests to the US Foreign Ministry.
The Foreign Ministry did not want to communicate with CBS, or with DV inquiry.
Gunter is one of the many politically appointed ambassadors of the Trump government, who have raised attention to unusual behavior in recent months.
For example, Woody Johnson caused a hard reaction when the day arrived that he was trying to get British to open the master meeting in a golf golf area in Trump’s possession.
The transmitter in South Africa has also been charged for driving his number two men and then trying to order her son to work.
42% of the U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed in the government of Obama, and 32% in the government of George W. Bush.

Poland will report on the European Convention preventing violence against women
The Polish Rights Government says that the country will deviate from the European Convention to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal form of the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “sickery ” as he requires schools to teach children about sex from a social perspective.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would begin preparing the formal process of the country’s telling himself about the contract.
“This ideological aspect is linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, in the field of study, attitude and conviction of young generations of Poles, based on the conclusion that our views are wrong, that biological sex is old - aged and that everything really is about social culture. ”
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the contract on education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT factor in the discussion on family relations, because this is a view held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the Council of Europe said that it was “awning” about the fact that Poland took up the agreement.
On Friday, the Warschau protested about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, outside the offices of the Ordo Luris, which supports the country’s proclamation of the contract.
“ We will not be victims, ” they called.
There were also protests in other cities of Poland.
In December 2012, Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence and implemented it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a machinemaker in the Holy Palace, died 81 years
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile - patch empire that included Lee’s father and his brother Richard, who was the first machinemaker that was taken into Nascar’s Holy Hall, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his death cause.
He hasn't been announced his funeral.
While other members of his family were celebrated for their abilities behind the drive, Maurice Petty gained the nickname “The Manager ” for his talents with the screw key.
He helped his family to work 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR’s excellent department, and he also built machines that guaranteed the victory of the Buddy Baker Holy Hall, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The boss was one of the most moving machines in NASCAR’s history, ” said the manager and manager Jim France.
“ He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises to reach his superiorities in the sports area.
Although Maurice had been known for his work under the skin, he also played various roles behind the tents and did what needed to bring his cars to the victory course."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, at Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race course when he was small, and his knowledge of mechanical activity soon became an important part of landing Lee Petty’s victory in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR cup in the years 1960-64, was seven times in five top seats and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what was happening under the machine shield rather than on the back of the drive, which proved a favor for his older brother, who relied on his machines during his victory.
Richard, then called the King, won the first championship in 1964 with a Plymouth car.
They again victored in 1967, then two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, and got three titles in addition before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share in the largest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of NASCAR’s true pioneers and was involved in building up one of NASCAR’s top teams, ” said Winston Kelley in an explanation.
“ Although Petty’s victories are recorded as 212 of his calls for over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as one of the best machines in NASCAR's history."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife to 52 years old, died in 2014.
He was also the cousin of the former driving tower and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, officer of the pallet car race.
“ Although we now say good - bye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and diligent pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his inheritance and his name will be stored in our memory, kept up and preserved forever, ” said Kelley.
"We send our deepest compassion to the Petty family."

Serbia wants to increase the number of military aircraft in increasing tensions in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more army planes as the tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Aleksander Vucic said that “a certain requests ” were being made for buying a fleet of fighting machines, and accused the United States and other Western states of having a armed neighbouring country of Serbia in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly in Serbia.
“ The Americans, the Turks, and the Germans care well about their loved descendant, ” said Vucic, referring to Cosovo.
He said that the United States had recently delivered the number of trucks to Kosovo’s security forces.
On a visit to the Serbian Army, Vucic said that his people could not compete with NATO’s contributions to the army of neighbors and that “this is why we are up to ourselves. ”
Vucic did not specify the type of Serbia’s army planes to buy, but the media of coherent governments say that his government officially requested 20 attack planes from the United States.
It appears that there were no answers from Washington at the request from Belgrade and that it would be rejected, it is likely that attack planes will be purchased by the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia.
Serbia, who is pursuing a policy of neutrality in military matters, has recently received a high-developed air protection system from Russia, which has also provided fever, attack helicopters, and trunked vehicles.
China, also a Serbian Federation, has delivered to the government for military use.
U.S. officials have discussed openly in order to introduce penalty operations against Serbia if more weapons come to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the safety of nearby NATO countries.
In the western countries and in the neighbouring countries of Serbia, people look at Russia’s and Chinese weapons in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, which depended on a human civil war in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance had a exchange of Serbia to stop the bloody operations of Serbia against the Cosovo-Albana separation in 1999.
Despite the formal attempt to join the European Union, the Serbian populist leadership has further strengthened its political and military relationship with Kreml and Beijing.
Serbia, Russia and China, do not acknowledge the independence of Cosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognised.

“The chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoid, methylxantine, polyphenol and sterinic acid, which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - concentration fitoprotine, collects “swappy” cholesterol – type of cholesterol that suffocates the heart’s arteries – and brings it into the liver.
The “sworn” cholesterol (high concentration lipid) is broken down in the liver and is then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not check dose sizes or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, lactose chocolate or other cacolate.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that chocolate consumption (as found in chocolate) decreased the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vaginal function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients over the body and transports waste.
Lifestyle factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had acknowledged chocolate eating would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stressed.
“Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys from books in a new collection reclame campaign
“ We have really listened, and there was a complete key point in preparing the project, ” said Ronson.
“ We don’t believe that people want to rebuild the books — we think they’ll want them, but it can recover them from their homes if they want it. ”
Ronson said that the new presentation campaign has been working long before COVID-19 came to history, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timetable for the new campaign has been “real good ” because of the amount of time parents spend with their children now.
The reporters have explained anxiety because consumers have become tired in the constant toy collection campaigns of the largest major markets, but Ronson says no signs of tiredness are still seen.
“ We have not seen anything like this yet, but we have our eyes always open for this,” she said.
“ We have a great deal of data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we leave is the same with our clients.
It was Cloes, the first about mid-2018, was the driver behind the best quarter sales of the largest market from the beginning.
Afterward, Woolworths followed Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the large market to increase its sales, and now last offers the environmental presentation campaign Discovery Garden customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign may have less effect at this time as UBS diagnoses predict the increase in sales in large markets in Australia at the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that clients can expect a variety of collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop may be rare.
“ There is a great deal of gathering campaigns around the world, and we are continually getting inspired from other countries, ” she said.
“ We need to do so to make sure that we are increasingly dealing with our clients. ”
Five rounds around the country in the summer
The photographer and material manufacturer John Ragnar Johannsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less on Iceland’s browsing since the world epidemic.
Jon completed the basis of business at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but he is now working on traveling and producing market materials for individuals and companies.
The summer began early with Jonah, or April, when he traveled throughout the West and stayed in his car.
The rest of the year, he has gone around five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has gone here and there on numerous day trips.
What is the journey?
“ For someone like me who is always on the door and has seen everything, it is hard to mention a favorite place.
It is more weather and society that matters everything.
After the opening of the roads in June, they have recently gone a lot to the highland.
Their journeys always stand up because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possibly favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together at 5 large cars by the Riverside and from there to the Alve Water."
What's up to you this summer?
“ It’s very exciting for me next time, but I was graduating a headquarters study with DIVE, and now I’m going to take up crawling trips here and there in Iceland.
Then I was adding a brimboard to the “dotaca sauce ” with me, so I get more out of the sea than before.
So I'm going on a 10 - day “solo” trip with everything I need my back, but it'll appear later in summer where I'm going.
Otherwise, I'll be very high in the next place, because it's not possible to look at that area all year."
What place in Iceland is your favorite place?
“ It’s always difficult to choose one place, but Jack’s lon has been a part of my life since I remember.
I and my family went every summer to a dwelling place at the roots of a Bretagne, and since then, I have always felt well in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've come there over 100 times."
Where in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it’s: Mulags in the South, Eastern Walls, Aldeyarfoss in the North, Red Sand in the West, West snowfalls in the West, and last but not last...
What is indispensable in the journey?
“ I don’t go to land unless I have the following in the car: Good pocket lights, hanging rooms, lobbys, hunting knifes, ankle cubs, refrigerators, and adorns... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 calms that are afraid to have drowned from the island of Malasia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaya (AP) — On Sunday, the authorities of Malaya said that 25 calm refugees were searched for the fear of drowning from a boat from the Langkawi island, north of Malaya.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high official at Malasia Land Holy Guard, said that the first information of the police showed that only one of the 25 calm men who had stuck off the boat had reached to swim to land.
According to Zawawi, the man who survived searched for police assistance late on Saturday and has been held as long as the case is examined.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people of Malachi, which has been the destination of a party who promises refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airlines were used to search.
He said that land - sailing will also make seafarers in the area and the authorities of the neighbouring country of Thailand aware that they can help the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities of Malachi held 269 calm refugees and found bodies of a boat suspected to have been used for smuggling from the coast of Langkawi, who claimed that he had been deliberately deliberately so that he could not go back to the sea.
Malasia’s sanctuary later stated that the 269 individuals had been transported from a larger ship with tens of people believed to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malachi could not accept more calm refugees in the economic situation because of the chronic era.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to the sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as about 180,000 refugees and refugee seekers — including 110,000 calms — are registered at the United Nations Refugee Organization.
Inhabitants of Aswan collect, guard, and return a farm of chocolate to Sudan after a motorcycle
On Sunday, at the gates of the village of Wadi Karkar, the driver fell into a coma because of a fever.
The villagers grouped to help the driver where he was lying and rescuing the product that had grown.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, explained his position so that the driver was “away by our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We should help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that villagers had arrived in an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the car farm, estimated at three million pounds of Egyptian.
Bahr said that villagers have been on the ground from morning to evening and have saved as much of the farm as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the farm, and reopen the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to give the damaged driver water and a shelter, said Bahr, adding that they would just ensure that he would come to and from the village safely.
The chronic virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone is a call to our preferred representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of trouble, ” says a report made by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also faced with other debt debts that concern the inheritance of our nation and the racial unequality that has harassed our country from its foundation. ”
The study examines known substances related to the embarrassing situation of the Congregation: lack of real links between groups, a schedule limiting the opportunity to communicate, too much co-compression of authority in leadership positions, constant budget requirements, differences in cooperation between categories, negative effects on the media working throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for parliaments are often foregoing and finally silence of minorities.
It is also warned that the congregation moves more to the network because of the world epidemic, where such a system that permits elections with the help of the representatives without the need to travel to Washington could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote meeting is closer to its footing, it would be a serious relapse for attempts to increase the interaction between groups, as the report says.
“ The world epidemic was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the House needs “more than no less communication between the Senators, face to face. ”
They need to study each other's territory better, have courteous conversations to find a common spot and build a link based on trust that can lead to greater understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly true in the week, when Ted Yoho, the republikaner of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democrat of New York, with events and his companions in the Rebublikan group, to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republic of Wyoming with hostile words.
Senator Val Demings talks about the Vice-President's office, tells Trump for gratification
The Demings Senator (Demorates, Florida) was not ashamed of discussing her interest in the office of Vice-President in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for being taken into account for the office.
This renowned member of the Black Group was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a direct broadcast because of #FIYAH! the Live programma and told about its history, energy and commitment that has brought it to the place she is at today, and started with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of worker and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Senatorial Assembly at Donald Trump’s trial in January.
Regardless of whether the elderly department insults Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth president accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the Congress of Representatives said: “It was worth it, and it has been worth it every day. ”
She added that, despite the disappointment of the decision, the democrats had been obliged to follow the case after its outcome.
In the interview, Demings clearly stated that she is a counterpart to Trump at Rogers Stone’s prison sentence, who was sentenced for lying before the Congress (always other crimes) as well as his grace to other criminals who were convicted for similar crimes, when she said: “The unfairness of reaching your friends, those who have lied and deceived to cover your wrongs. ”
Deamings is at the top of the list Joe Biden of possible beneficiaries to the Vice President, which also holds President Karen Bass CBC (democrates, California), Stacey Abram's former parliamentary of Georgia, the Senators of Harris (democrates, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms CEO Atlanta, Susan Rice former ambassadors of the United States, and some others.
However, she argued that only one person would decide who would present himself with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she gave her hand to her mouth while she laughed and felt whispering at those who looked at the direct broadcast, and added, “If you want to call... then you can do it for me.”
No doubt, regardless of the political views of each one in history, this period will be considered as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This wasn't past Demings.
It noted that the number of women present to the USA’s Deputy President is an opportunity to break through the remainder of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s just this opportunity that I’m working so hard that I have my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of wrong sex, ” she said.
The consensus intended to ensure that the Democratic Group’s National Committee and the Biden election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to make as many as possible to choose as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Committee) and I will put this on the top of my list,” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election campaign.
When she answered the ex - foreign minister Hillary Clinton’s words that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his elections, and another editorial article that says that the president is preparing to reach himself, lived over Demings: “As much as suggests to reach himself, I was disgusting. ”
“ But who would ever do it different than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the Governing Register in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't lose.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens I just want to be with them who let it happen."

Gurugram, July 26, the company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to the court in Gurugram, after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been dismissed for contradicting the reporting and false news in the company’s programmes.
The case is addressed in the Gurugram District Court, and the Prime Court of Justice, Sonia Sheokand, has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others and asked them to come to the court on July 29, according to the news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.

“We are responsive to the company’s obligations to the Indian market and the welfare of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with local laws.
We cannot express ourselves on the present case," said UC India in an explanation.
The "list of vulnerable words" includes the Hindi and English passwords such as "India and China borders" and "the war between China and India", which is stated in the case of UC Web used to review materials on their systems in India," says Reuters.
Last month, the Interior Ministry banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, as a result of increased tension between the two countries.
Representative of New York City's Fireplace says it's all right to take a white firefighter away from honour.
According to a new news, a representative of the New York Municipality Firefighter says that it is “complete” to keep a white firefighter away from honour so that flagbearers can all be black.
The white firefighter Daniel McWilliams has appealed to the discrimination of race after he was taken out of a group of flag bears at a Memorial Mass in November 2017 to remember the falling members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firefighters.
In addition, the principal representative of the firefire in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Department of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the department who, on a historical picture, lift the American flag at the Ground Zero on the days of the 11 September attacks.
According to McWilliam’s dear, the firefire commission had chosen him to be alone for the flag bears in honor of the Memorial.
It was a “great honor and privilege ” for McWilliam to be a flag bearer in this ceremony, according to CNN.
However, when he arrived at the ceremony, he was forbidden to participate in the honor of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because, as it was claimed, she had asked that all flag bears at the fair would be black.
She then asked McWilliam – a 29 - year - old employee of the New York City firefire – to help in another way."
Among other things, it claims that she asked him to do is to accompany unchanged civilians and set up characteristic firefighters from the mess.
McWilliams claimed in his law that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honour because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has served at the New York City Fire For 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliam claims that he left the memorial “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation and shame, ” as friends and coworkers heard what went between them, according to New York Daily News.
When the Black Loving witnessed before the court, McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “Why praying that everyone be black in honour is not a difference? ”
“ No, it isn’t, ” said Loving, according to New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask for everyone to be black in honour, and she replied: “Very well. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person to “high up our speciality and different origins to create pride, consensus, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a complaint on discrimination from races in New York City's firefire in January 2018.
He then brought a case against Wilson, the firefire of New York City, New York City, and unnamed persons in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam's complaint, his supporters Wilson had revenged and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put his hands on McWilliam and said: “I have heard of you, they told me that you would be like this, and now you know who I am. ”
Sullivan wrote that it would have been “disgusting ” to exclude McWilliam from honor at the mess and signs that one thing was not all valid at the firefire.
“ If you are a black person and you differ from a white person at the workplace, you will mostly be reminded, ” said Sullivan.
According to the prosecution, Wilson received a "consultation for one hour" because of her treatment with McWilliam.
In the meantime, a white person who disagrees with the black person will receive “excessive punishment, ” Sullivan wrote.
“The New York City Defence has created a policy and process that is intended to please the members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist manner, apologize their actions and their helpers ... and this must stop,” wrote Sullivan too.

Thousands of Khabarovsk’s inhabitants still demand the remarks of Putin
Thousands of towns joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested against the arrest of the district manager in the so-called region south of Eastern Russia and his successors, who have never lived in the region.
The former district manager, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed a great popularity, and thousands of people in the city protested when he was arrested and sent to Moscow’s preservation earlier this month, accused of ordering murder of three traders 15 years ago.
In the past week, Furgal was formally appointed as the governor and his 39 - year - old group brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, in his place, with little impression of the locals.
When Degtaryev is said unexperienced and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the city’s people the snarest.
They've called Degtaryev like a wind around their ears.
Yesterday’s protesters were smaller than in the first Protestants, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and they were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the statement of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
“We want the governor to be released, because we consider that his arrests are very likely to be illegal,” the ACP reporting office after 30 protesters, Alinu Slepova.
She claims that Kremlar’s agents had arrested Furgal “to defend their own interests but not the country’s interests. ”
The police in Khabarovsk made Protestants unreasonable, despite the strict violation of a local meeting ban due to the chronic virus age.
On the other hand, in Moscow, the police arrested at least ten people who met at the Pushkin Square to show Protestants in Khabarovsk support in work, says the British newspaper Guardian.
The group of Furgal, the Free Democratic Group of Russia, is a group of nationalists, and is considered to be somewhat loyal to the Crimean Government in most matters.
However, the same political reporters inform the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the two - year district elections — which were great and unambiguous — had been a considerable shock for Putine and the United Russia, and even though it suggested that the Kremlar attack on the eastern regions was being weakened.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is waiting for trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in the years 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were made: but the third went out of the dust.
Sarah Rainsford, reporter BBC of Moscow, says followers of Furgal, who enjoy a popular home front, convinced that the charge and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government has waited to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his claimed fracture.
Trees went off when the turbulent Hanna was raging over South Texas.
On July 25, Hanna fell into the strength of a tropical storm after he landed at the beaches of the southern part of Texas, but the government warned that the storm could still cause human abrupt floods.
The weather office of the United States said that the largest threat in the southern part of Texas and the northeastern part of Mexico was to move west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo departed this video on Twitter and said Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.

According to the authorities, the project has contributed to the reduction of positive cases by 50 percent, as Chennai daily, while they are increasing in other regions of Tamil Nada.
Shanthi says that not all people are cooperative.
She adds: “The majority are cooperatives when a woman with disability approaches them.
Some, however, will be irritated.
But this is not to be worried about.
I think people should be safe.
When I get back the next day, people will be courteous.
It helps build up a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's hostages for women with disability and fight against Covid-19 teams.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also disabled, has also participated in the campaign as an overseer.
Though Kavitha has a specially prepared bicycle, she starts to meet people and keeps on her necklaces.

Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the governor of the Gistyle, and the Dorcas Research Station, who runs the cloud, say: “They are adapting to the needs of every moment.
Before they needed masks, they did not leave their own.
Now it is time to intervene in the community, and they answered the call."

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of disparity
Last weeks, it has been realized that many bones are still in the closet in connection with race rights in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to be conducted and actions must be taken to ensure that all are welcome to sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former croquet star at Proteas, made his former white teammates hear of it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black men were “quota players. ”
Prince said that the black players of Protea have been officially called “quota players ” of their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada were at the top of the sports, some people were still connected to the quota talk.
Prince, who is now the trainer of Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisation (UCSCBO) on Thursday evening.
The aim of the conciliation is to continue the fiery discussion of historical race rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I lighted my mind on social media, it is not my intention to come and draw people’s names into the scene, but these are real events...
"You'll do everything right, but you'll get infected anyway."
Paul Roberts, former musician and manufacturer who became NASA’s developer, is now working at a software company.
He and his wife, the former nurse at the Methodist Hospital, who viewed himself as an optimist, kept out of an interesting journal on the Internet and visited Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they pussy them with their two daughters, their son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandchild and play a huge Uno-game.
“ They are incredible norths, ” says the 38 - year - old Roman about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the world epidemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that may increase its risk.
Her husband has a chronic pulmonary disease and a bone that keeps a previously stiff corneal seed open.
“ We have been so cautious, very careful, keeping away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working home in the spring, when the epidemic struck hard on Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a large market in “the old men’s time, ” and, according to Sheryl, their only real date in recent months was when they began to look at wild flowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter also went carefully.
But then, one day at mid - June, she came home from work and thought she was allergic.
Soon she received cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell sense, which are typical symptoms of the chronic virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what's going on, Mom, but I had a mask, washing my hands, ” she said.
"You do everything right, but you get infected anyway."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positive chronic virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse in her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, like their daughter, and then got a warm and great pain in the body.
Then, sheryl Roberts said, “he became very sick, very quick. ”
June 22, he became confused.
She carefully examined his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to emergency, for the second time in two days.
The former kingly couple felt that they were “honored ” in the Queen’s Christmas talk, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Britaprins found his grandmother, British Queen, “ignored ” them in their Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they have been overlooked by those in the collection that was seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk at which the queen was sitting showed, among other things, the Vilhhelm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl British Prince, and his wife of Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see, despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “power of grandchildren. ”
The new book, published in August, also shows that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends, ” as they“ have hard to overcome superficial courtesy ” and only met a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother Willhelm’s dissatisfaction began some years before his relationship with Meghan, but that it reached a peak because of the marriage of Willhelm and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “a warner ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, so it is said that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history. ”
The Senators of the Conservation Group accuse the work leaders of wanting to keep officials “resident forever. ”
The Congress of the Conservation Group accuses the work leaders of wanting officials to be “resident forever” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
After protesting to Boris Johnson’s call to the people to return to work, the officers were accused of wanting employees to “speak at home forever. ”
The Senators of the Conservatives were angry when a union of officials and general workers told their fellow workers to spy at their feet when their supervisors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “unacceptable” that the need for public service, such as the release of passports, would be a stop while employees in the general market would have worked hard on keeping society running during the chronic virus age.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while employees in stores and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that officials can eat during this time, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on summer vacation, but they can’t do so because of the people who refuse to return to their places of work, even though they are safe.
Officers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now when we know that people can return to work safely."
Following a call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, newly appointed business manager of public service, announced that the Ministry “was obliged to turn away from officials from their homes, and to speed up their return to their workplaces until August 1.
The organization of officials and public employees expressed their colleagues, who consider about 200,000 people, that they did not have to meet this requirement, and said that this was about politics.
A spokesman of the union of officials and general workers, the largest union of officials in Britain, said that the requirement for returning to workplaces was “not set out with health and safety of our associates in priority or in order to strengthen the economy.
This is done unanimously because of political pressure from the Congress of the Congress, which requires that official service be used as an example to bring others back to work.
Our recommendations to fellow workers are clear: If you do your jobs at home and someone in your department asks you to return to the workplace, do not take it as of course you need to do so."
The dispute can be caused by increasing dissatisfaction with the late version of passports because employees work at home, but about 400,000 people are now told to wait for their application.
The Intergovernmental Ministry has now published that applications from the United States will be “necessary to speed up” in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The union of public and public employees has admitted that some have had to wait for up to 143 days for passports, but they claim that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4000 employees of the passport service to keep the necessary distance.
David Davis, former minister of government, urged the leaders of a working party to “have a wise course ” and to seek ways to cooperate with governments to bring people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask an officer: “What is it you want, that people stay home all summer? ”
However, many of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendations to people to return to work.
A study of larger jobs with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40 000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
The gift has expanded, but understanding and satisfaction should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this knowledge and understanding shortage.
Too little is taught by a lovely history.
The fact is that without a radical operation, the only lesson that deals specifically with our history – “Say Australia” for the 12th grade – will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria graduated in Australia’s history of 49.324 who graduated in primary school, or only 1%.
During the last six years, these figures have almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 less students registered each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th class is that little has been done in the previous years of study to stimulate their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “consciousness. ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grade completed only one short unit on "the first-inhabitants and the islands of Torres and their culture".
In the 9th and 10th year, Australia is another unit in the world wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during the primary school years.
In the 9th and 10th year, the second optional unit is between 1750 and 1918.
It is urgent to take three actions to save the passionate history in Victoria’s schools.
First, such as English, mathematics, and science, history must become an independent study.
Since a story is only a part of science, it gets little space in the study.
It is generally taught by people who have general education in intellectual science but have not learned in history.
Historic skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
We need to advise more specialist historian scholars to ensure that such skills are in a accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 will become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s story at 12 years of study, for then they would have had to learn the material from the base.
Knowledge in the history alone and seeing bridges are not deeply interrelated between races.
But without it, as clearly seen in Victoria’s study book, the mission is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a parliamentarian of a volunteer at the Congress of Victoria and former assistant school manager Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.

Many are going to tent in their gardens and to rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Muta in the saint on the wave.
“ There is nothing yet that is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
Something is true that the Eyes are going to have tent celebrations at home.
“ People have spoken about being with their own [feast], perhaps tents in the garden, and gathering their family together as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend their time with their people.
However, it is likely that many people will simply not be there, “but still keep some small National Festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna thinks that many homemen will rather ensure a ticket for the next year.
“ People are even investing in the centers now and making validity for 2021. ”
“ I am a great People’s Party, loved the preparation and all around this, but sometimes something comes into the life you do not govern, and then it is just that, ” says Anna, but there has been something about people asking if the Eyers can’t let go of the National Festival “so once. ”
Anna Lilja says that the group has not set up for herself or to encourage people to celebrate their own National Festivals, but to gather sources of Commerce Festivals in the Eyes of this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one or anything, but then some who use such sources in something but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At that time, burning has been charged on the Firewall, which is burned each year.
“ I think many are excited to get burned on Friday evening.
The only thing that, of course, makes a strike in the account is that the prophecy is nothing specimens."
“ This burning will be fired, but it just needs to show how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new documents on sexual fraud?
The British king family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
The United States Judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among the items found in these 80 pages of documents are parts of Maxwell’s witness from 2016
The display of this late may also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrew, where there is a communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the sex slave of the disgusting American financer, claimed in 2015 in legal documents that she had been forced to communicate with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information during the week with even harmfuler accusations of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his meant madman, Ghislaine Maxwell.
This week, the U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The presentation of these huge extensive documents would be a shock for the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have large parts of her witnessing before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “previous questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrew, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, referring to the sex slave of the disgusting American financer, claimed in 2015 in legal documents that she had been forced three times to communicate with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
A computer e-mail from 2015 that has been leaked and BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés requested Maxwell’s help to respond to Robert’s claims.
There is no doubt that the Duke will be rebellious
There he said to the superior woman: “Well me when we can talk, and there are certain questions that I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell answered: “There is information, call me when you have a free time. ”
Last night, a writer near Andrew said: “The Duke of Jorvik has not done anything wrong, so we are not worried about opening a document.
As courts in the United States have endeavored to point them out, this does not mean that a accusation is true even if it appears in documents.
U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the accusations presented in documents.
We fully agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now at the Manhattan Maintenance Centre and is waiting for courts to find and deceive some of Epstein’s victims who were under law from 1994 to 1997.
It is also blamed for refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last talked to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s injurious prince, which is now under the surname Giuffre, which she took up after a marriage.
About 40 pages of 418 of those witnesses were published last year, but after Judge Presna, New York, last week, last week, more items could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to make an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was in court because of sexual fraud.
Investigators are seeking crime for violent attacks on Edinburgh’s streets
Three of them attacked a man in Edinburgh, and they caused him an injury that could prove lasting.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, director of the study, said: “This was a violent and reasonless attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be 40 years old, about a height of 180 cm and a strong growth.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white bowl, dark pants and dark shoes.
Miles Detective said: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was carried out, and I saw something suspicious to give up. ”
The messenger wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, wants to carry a gun here in the country and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “profant ” about his security since he arrived in the country last year.
This is seen in the CBS news, which also says that this will be Gunter, despite his work in “one of the safest kingdoms in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs to embark upon the Icelandic Government to carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a trunked car and a west that protects him from knives.
However, the CBS reporters repeatedly announced to Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
The CBS report says that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not provide information on whether a request was received from the United States for a possible weapon of Gunter, because the authorities did not express the security measures of foreign agencies.
However, the sources of the news office say that no request was made.
Then CBS also has it after its sources that Gunter was told that he should not seek weapons, so it would be taken as an insult here in the country.
Gunter is an unexperienced epilepsy, which has been a healthcare doctor in California for years.
He's active in the Republican Group of the United States and an active supporter, President Donald Trump.
He recently made attention to the “invisible virus ” in this country.
CBS also reports that Gunter was very deeply affected by the U.S. ambassador in Reykjavík.
He already had seven next - personnel at the ambassador from May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “Deep Kingdom, ” called the network of U.S. officials who work against Trump, and resented that one had snow into his office.
The consignor traveled to Washington D.C. in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter was said to have wanted to work from California, but at the end, Mike Pompeo, United States Foreign Minister, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The world play form is a key point for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games in the future when the adherents get back to plays
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the selection department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good walk at home if the audiences were released to play.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six joints above has lost more in the home.
The coach of Portuguese said that even though such victories were possible without the followers, it would be easier to maintain it if they were in the place.
“ We have to do this with the attendants, and without them there can be some kind of activity, where the program is in the foreground, ” he said.
“ But I think that it was much more powerful to do so with the attendants, because then the emotional side of the game, which is only next with the help of fans at the home scene, is added. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger contests, it will be more and more difficult to maintain the long periods of victory at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up in the past three seasons.
But this is also a key element in determining whether the end of the period will reach its goals, especially in equal games and neighborhood laws, where the atmosphere on the field can vary.
“ I believe that the policy of the decorative department is that it now becomes more and more difficult to strike these unpleasant estimates because of what has been done good. ”
“ On the other hand, it is important to be strong at home and have, at the end of the season, collected a number of points with victories in home games. ”
“ I’m happy with the finals from home games in the past, without the fans, but we need them back.
I can see a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It's compassion that is built up gradually."
Buyers excited for desired lifestyle properties in Lovely Banks
"Larger is better," is evidently the motto of new owners of huge property in the Lowely Banks district, which was recently sold at a dollar of 1270 in Australia.
Interesting buyers looking for lifestyle property near the centre of Geelong flooded to look at this 1,35 hectares land, where there can be cars for 14 cars, swimming pools and views of the Corio Flow.
Joe Grigic, a real estate dealer in Harcourts, Northern Geelong, said that an offer in the land property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its marketing.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Selected home for isolation
“ We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Gregic.
“ The property was sold to a very excited homeman. ”
The property is accompanied by four rooms on two hills, including a private bathroom that is large enough to sleep.
The new owners have three rooms to choose, and they can take advantage of the kitchen and refresh the area with views of the pool.
“It was in the way the property was composed, that she was three yards, and that she was in this place,” said Gregic.
“ There came interesting buyers from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle of the area, but still had a landfill.
“ I have people who missed and buyers who are still searching. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free-standing closure of more than 10 to 12 vehicles, would be perfect for industryers or to store a bike and trailers.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been profane about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik in last year. ”
This is how the detailed report of CBS News on U.S. ambassadors in Iceland begins, which simulates numerous sources of CBS from the United States’ foreign service.
The CBS report claims that Gunter wished to the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he would be given special permission of the Icelandic governments to carry weapons.
He was also supposed to have asked for a busy car, as well as for ideas about the west that could protect him from knive attacks.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is truly threatened in Iceland, but according to officials’ information, Gunter has repeatedly been expressed that he is not in any special danger.
Despite the recent advertising of the U.S. ambassador in Iceland following full - time life guards, including in the morning newspaper of July 18 last year, CBS states that it is done to sleep Gunter’s anxiety.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on specific security operations related to its ambassador, but it always states the objective of ensuring security in a preventive manner.
The Council does not answer questions concerning Gunter’s request for arms and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry to say whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassadors bear weapons, and usually do not express themselves on security issues of foreign broadcasting offices.
On the other hand, the CBS has, according to its Icelandic sources, never made a request for the subject, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter has been given from these plans, which might inflict residents in Iceland.
The CBS report also deals with the various problems that have been the attractive U.S. ambassador in Iceland since Gunter was appointed an ambassador last year, but he will have already divided his spare agent seven times.
Thus, the first savior is said to have long prepared for his work and learned English only to have been denied in the last hour because Gunter “do not find him ” at their first meeting.
His followers have not been much better under the rule of Gunter.
Governments of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs are declared aware of the position in the Icelandic ambassador, but are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the President.
Besides all, Gunter is said hesitant to follow the various rules of foreign service and respect the rule of rule.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and it is said that he refused to return to Iceland as a result of his temporary replacement for his work for months, and in the middle of the world’s epidemic.
Will Gunter have even desired to carry out his job at a remote work and will not claim to return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically requested it.
According to information from the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take his personal permission after the conference ended and the chronic antiviral age was still more delayed, but according to the CBS authorizations, many of them would have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he had not done so until May, after Pompeo had contacted him and asked him to return to the Iceland Office.
The CBS report also reports on the hostile Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with the cereals, which calls the chronic virus “the invisible Chinese virus” and has been given great criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced in the field of foreign service, appointed by the President of the United States, Donald Trump.

“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say that he is going to flag his wealth in a arouse like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried Northern Iranian superpower Rhys McKee in their battles in the abu Dabi on Saturday night when he victored his contest when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed from the first cycle by having him beaten in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in UFC’s history for the shortest time between victory in the modern history, where only 10 days had passed since he conquered Britain John Phillips in a similarly crucial way, then in intermediate.
Chimaev, with a victory ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 US dollars for the performance of the evening against McKee and has so fully taken the attention of the MMA world that it is now called "Khalib 2.0", which may be an inevitable comparison because of the probability between the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC master in light and where he is born in Tétenia, which is close to the homeside of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newly found celebrities and financial benefits, the translated Chimaev said that he would not be grateful to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his partner in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked to the Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has observed Conor McGregor’s teammates and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social note that he could “simplely” win Chimaev with an outgoing speed.
It was not a poisonous response from the fighter who is under the name “Borz, ” or“ wolf, ” in his native Czech language, who said that he would “male Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the 19 - year - old country, may not be able to suffer from his financial power, but he is evidently unable to dress his fighting skills.
“I can paint anybody...
How many fighters are in the VAT?
I can paint them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of masters, 84 kilos of masters, I will paint both of them the same day. ”
Israel continues to resist the reaction of Prime Ministers to the World Epidemics
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the Prime Ministers in all parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official office of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protest has lasted for a few weeks, but it began because critics believe that the government’s neglect should react to the chronic virus age after they have succeeded in maintaining the threat of the virus at the outset.
Prosecution against Netanyahu for corruption has further undermined the protests.
“ Bibi, go home, ” on the sign of one of the Protestants.
On a second chart, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside the Netanyahu beach house in the well - prized city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
Following the so-called rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day rose to 2000.
The country's economy has been struck because of the limitations caused by the virus, and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
Protesters say that the government’s financial assistance has no near enough.
The protest took place in the shadow of courts of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again during the month.
The hearings will begin in January.
He is accused of betrayal, confidential failure, and mutuality in a series of disasters.

50 people multi-data targets in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the Government of Karnataka
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31th and August 1st.
Karnataka's governments have published that only 50 may be gathered in mosques for prayer for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places due to the chronic virus age.
Guests who want to pray for in mosques must have masks and keep away, according to AB Ibrahim’s order, Ministry Manager, and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha feast, also called Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodaga, but on August 1, elsewhere in the State.
The order states that even though prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be prohibited because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosques, given that no more than 50 are involved in one.
If more than that should be divided in prayer, the Ministry of the Order says.
Prayer meetings should not be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal. ”
The Karnataka Government allows temples, mosques and other prayer places to be opened to those who want to be prayed from 8 June, given that the protection of infectious diseases should be carefully monitored because of COVID-19.
The U.S. ambassador wants a armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, believes his life is threatened in the country and wants to have weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. ambassador repeatedly advertised by the bodyguards in the Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English bodyguard in the advertising.
According to Kveik’s accounts, the main reason for these jobs was advertised that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes that his life is threatened in Iceland.
Fires have discussed with sources of Iceland and foreigners who have convinced the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he belongs to Jewish families.
Each threat is not as clear, but Kvek’s respondents said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS TV station discussed the issue on its web this morning, and according to the Washington Authors Gunter’s insane persecution, demands that he bear himself a weapon, bear a steady west, and accompany armed vehicles.
According to CBS, Gunter has been repeated that there is no threat and that the bodyguard advertising is only for sleeping Gunter.
According to Kveik’s accounts, the stations had not been managed in June, but the application report went out in February.
According to Kveik’s sources, no formal action has been received by the United States Mission for these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased guarding or for authorization for lifeguards to walk outside the ambassador’s walls.
Icelandic laws are decisive that this is not allowed except with a special authority from the Head of State Police.
In the control system, the respondents of Kicks do not provide any information about any danger.
The latest hazardous assessment by the Head of the State of Police is somewhat decisive about terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorists or extreme groups are working here.
According to Kveik’s sources, the beneficiaries of a foreign ambassador’s arms on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are not present.
Gunter raised considerable attention here in the country when he departed the President of the United States and called the COVID-19 "China virus".
He then had the American and Icelandic flag with the timing.
A radioman in Seattle who ridiculed to Trump's reaction to Protestants say now needs to get a gun after the Starbucks coffee house below his apartment was placed in ruin – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has a new perspective of violent protests after he was caught at President Donald Trump of the United States in June, saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed was that the cruelty would come closer to the owner’s home.
“I feel like I need to buy me a guns because this will clearly continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that damaged wolves had “devastated” the Starbucks coffee house at the bottom of his multitude.
"Now it's enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now."
The difference was when Trump complained last month that CEO of Seattle allowed the city to be conquered by violent Protestants.
“ These freely democrats are glorious, ” said the president.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a member of the “Danny & Gallant ” part of the ESPN collaborative radio station in Seattle, replied:“ Go through there for curiosity last night and see neither burn, robbery nor death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building, where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffeehouse.
He printed pictures of the damages and said: “Well done, idiots, ” and said that he had also seen fire a few house lengths away.
“I have no idea what's going on, but we're going to find out. ”
The reversal did not pass by people who were ridiculous to Gallant for his previous view and tied messages like “Sleak only on lax” and“Jah, perhaps Trump had right for himself.”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “If we are not finally going on this viewing trip that we were discussing. ”
Gallant was laughing: “Awakened and saw that a lot of people were screwed up for me, and I laughed. ”
He said he was standing at his previous claim as he had walked through the CHAZ self-government area of anarchy and although it wasn't as bad as it had been declared as.
"Then it was burned and robbed after all things," he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, looking for an apartment with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the recording site of the White Lines, which deals with the suck and swallows of Ibiza, but in a search for accommodation in the past week, their sight was another and quieter, far away from the enjoyment of the party island.
The couple who play a sibling in the Netflix series of popularities have seen a glorious occupation in Oxfordshire, which is for sale of 1.2 million pounds.
They arrived in the Range Rover area, which Laura, 34, drove, coated pants and white balls, where they met real estate stores that led them on a viewing trip around the house of five rooms.
In White Lines, recorded in the last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who knows the darker side of Ibiza when she examines the murder of her brother, the album scooter Alex, played by Tom, 28 years old.
Not until this month, within a year after the six - year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, he is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, the four - year - old son of Pip and the two - year - old daughter of Margot belong to them.
When they reported the divorce last August, on Instagram, Claflin 34, wrote: “I have decided to understand a divorce, we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for one another, and we will continue our cooperation with our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audience test, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “without hesitation one of the greatest results of my life. ”
Before she got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from BBC, which was shown last year, where she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom took a role in the second Inbetweener film and in the series of Brittania from Sky.
Counts too early to claim about another wave here in the country
A specialist in the field of pollution at the ACP says too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected yesterday at the National Hospital virologic department and have been infected by thousands of people.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, another in a thirty - year - old man than the other in a 20 - year - old man.
Since the beginning of the month, no infection had been detected.
Yesterday, there were three additional domestic infections, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football meeting in Laugardal.
John K. Johnsson, a police officer of the State, said in a conversation with a news station that fewer people had to take the show because of the contamination that was originally considered.
Another infection is in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15th.
At that time, rules on the so - called return gate had been valid.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus ’ daughter, an infectious expert at the National Medical Institute, says that the person has followed the old process.
The vision of him was negative when he came to the land, and he became sick, which was in isolation, and had six in an infectious state.
They are all on the way to show, but two of them have been showing symptoms.
The third infection is then associated with the older man that was diagnosed on Thursday, and 12 have been infected in connection with it.
It has been observed that on the journey, the new types of the chronic virus that have not been previously identified here in the country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who was considered to have brought the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It believes too early to claim that the so - called other waves of the epidemic have started in this country, just as other European countries are afraid.
“ As long as the majority are still distant, it is not the table that is.
But we are on our toes and are watching, thinking of ways to fail, if something like that might go away."

“ As I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in star marks and I immediately knew that my twin soul was about," says the 34 - year - old Fox.
“ Twin - soul is when the soul has reached a sufficient degree of existence to divide it into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two halfs of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it immediately."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the stars and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."

Increased gravity in protests against racial rights in the United States
Contestants have walked through streets of cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
In Portland, Oregon, a two - month protest has been held, since May 25, when George Floyd killed a police arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI officers to Portland, and thereby still understood the protests.
Contestants are also opposed to the city’s officials.
On Saturday, in Seattle, police used explosions and tear gases and arrested 45 people, after protest meetings to support the protests in Portland were dissolved in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 policemen were hurt.
One of them died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into the Black Live Matter requirement.
According to the media, the man could have walked up to a car gun before he was shot.
“ The point of the matter is that it is terrible that someone die in protests, ” stated Steve Adler, Citizen of Austin.
Adler claimed to be “sworm and sad. ”
In Luisville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor’s case, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
The boyfriend Taylor had first shot at the police because he thought they were inbreakers.
One policeman has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other policemen have not been accused.
The president of the NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the police investigation of Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were hurt on Saturday when the rebel army accidentally shot.
Possible group infection in cessation
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of them infected with previously unseen virus varieties, and the origin of three out of five viruses seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals were infected by a tourist who has returned from the country or the unidentified Icelander, who likely infected many more.
The local physician says that possible group infection may be in a seal in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with either form of virus.
The origin of infections is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them was infected by one of those who were diagnosed on Thursday, one came to the country last July 15th, probably infected outside, but the third is also infected with unclear origin.
Following a series analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with the new types of virus that have not previously been identified here in the country have been shown.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a parasite expert at the Agricultural Medicine and a paramedic, says that the islandic genetic analysis is now going to determine where this type of virus is likely to have occurred.
“ Another incident was the same virus that has been in force in Switzerland but is not exactly the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the chances of which part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
“ But it seems to be here on the side of the Atlantic. ”
Thus, the infected infections were not connected to the two who came up at the beginning of July, and were featured to the United States.
Do you imagine that this new species has come outside rather than have mutated inland?
“Yes, this is different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this was something to mall here,” replies Kamilla.
“There is all the likelihood that these individuals have in some way come to a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it for themselves. ”
As asked, it says that yet there is no evidence of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ It could naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get any symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected and could naturally get more infections afterwards.
We'll be on the toes of the next few days to watch it."
“ But there is no clear group infection.
But there are individuals who went into disease in connection with one of the infections last night, who have symptoms and have gone to show," continues Kamilla.
“ We have not yet come to their conclusions.
So that might be a group infection in a seal."
Do you assume that there is a social infection now?
“ It is not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we don't know who had carried this infection in these individuals who were diagnosed on Thursday and yesterday." she answers.
Would it be possible to say that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But naturally, we need to be very careful, and we need to keep in mind this, even though there are so certain limits on how much we can take from people’s visions.
We don't take a specimen in symptomless people, but first we are getting infections that seem to be inconsistent, we need to be given a little more loose hands by taking a specimen out of people with symptoms,” she says.
Thus, it can be expected that the Anti-Virus and Anti-Virus Division of the Land Hospital will be given in the exhibitions in the next few days to try to map the situation in this country better.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the visualization of the country and to take care of the land borders?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking a specimen in individuals who are not in the screening work; the person must be in sickness and show symptoms or have experienced symptoms and suspects of getting clear with someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She argues that infectious infections that were diagnosed yesterday are still in progress and that they are now doing a great deal of work in obtaining information about the travel of individuals.
It says that the origin of domestic infections seems unreasonable, but it does not exclude that some of those who have now been infected can provide evidence that ultimately leads the infectious team to original infections.

Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical zoom enables the addition lens on pixel 4 to see in three dimensions, thus returning a better mode in the background with face image settings than in previous pixel phones, which trusted the alpha of software to achieve these so-called "bokeh" effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, the Google legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz got up to the scene to discuss his experience of photographing with Pixel 4 over the last 12 months.
Computer study is still in the foreground of all aspects of Google's new smartphones, and in this telephone, "computer-controlled photography" is new to improve the HDR+ setting by merging up to nine different pictures.
New dual description controls offer different slides for lightness and shadow and allow users to preview HDR+ for real time.
The phone also relys on machine study to offer better automatic white blast and improve the Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to other camera devices, pixel 4 Soli presents a "radiary plane" on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can let go, switch off time measurements, put a waver on the blown or turn off the sound of the phone by waving the hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are made in the device instead of connecting to the Internet, and the same applies to the re-enhanced Google helper, since the engineer now stresses the shortening of the response time and the improvement of the user's personal protection.
The continuing emphasis on the full use of its machine study skills has also led to a new voice recording app that transmits audio instantly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
pixel 4 will also be the first phone that supports Google Stadia, the play area in the cloud that will be released from the 19th of November in the United States, but still after reporting the date for Australia.
In addition to new pixel phones, Google also presented new pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generation Google Pixel Buds hearing tools.

Google also announced the update of its connected Wi-Fi home legs in the Nest Wi-Fi line with special bones, along with many basic sites that work together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will take up the Nest name, doubles its preservation and adds the built-in sound sensors and speakers to use the Google helper at each base of the home.
It's sold in Australia, November 5, and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has received built-in wall mounting.

A stang hunter in Devon, “the love throws a bottle of beer into sale”
According to a charity organization, a stranger threw a bottle of beer into sale when he interrupted the fishing line.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show you on a rock that throws a object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the grey sele had been hunting when the stang hunter emptyed a bottle and threw it in the back of the beast.
Kenny called this “frightful and reluctant behavior. ”
He said he was picking up waste at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning with other people in the Seal Project sales company when he witnessed the attack.
“ The soul tried to get into the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The fisherman stretched the beer, cleared the bottle, and threw it into the sale.
"The bottle landed on the back of the cell, and it swimed away."
Kenni said that “the better would be to sell strong animals ” than that the cell had simply done what was natural to him.
“By throwing a bottle of glass into him, you stop him on his hunting,” he said.
The Seal Project company said that this was “not a unique case” and that it had recently received “many notifications of this aggressive behavior”.
The Society's Facebook post says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection of Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of social behavior ” were seen.
All sellers are protected by the law of protection of sales, and people are asked to stay away from them.

The protesters of racial hatred encounter with the police in Seattle
Conflicts in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended by the number of people arrested, but dissatisfaction among the public due to the plan of the President of the United States of Donald Trump to send a number of federal police into major cities.
Resistance against racial hatred and police violence has arisen after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
The protesters in Seattle cut cycling cars and broke windows in wheelhouses on the protests on Saturday, which led to police exclaiming disorders and emptying the streets with pepper sprays and blows.
The protesters also turned on in a bicycle house in a building area for a prospective adolescent.
The police claimed to have arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen would have hurt.
The protest was held to support the protests in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the scene light after Trump ordered a very radical action by the federal police, in the ignorance of local authorities, who say that the police are excessively exercising.
Protesting has been conducted in Austin, Texas, as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed fights in the middle of towns on Saturday evening, according to the police.
Together with the Protestants, Trump is increasingly challenging for re-election in November, and has developed a tough legal policy.
