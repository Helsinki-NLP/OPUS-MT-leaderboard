The Prague Stock Exchange falls against business conclusion into a minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague stock exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague stock exchange was linked to the break-in from Monday when it decreased by six more percentage points at the beginning of the Tuesday transactions.
This time was the reason for the burglary at the Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is also shown in the Czech Republic.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the stocks on the markets in Asia on Tuesday, although the indexes were able to compensate some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was possible to compete some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese stocks at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchanges in Taiwan decreased by 3.6 per cent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is unsafe and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The rates of interest in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
The American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, as the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, and approve the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries are threatened to be affected by the break-in.
A Blood Bath of American shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system for which up to $700 billion (fastly 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators ignored President George Bush's invitation to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index decreased by nearly seven percent, a similar breakthrough he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had dropped before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft of the House of Members would not come through, the index experienced a free case.
Congress admits: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The Higher Representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the US financial system.
It is to be voted at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators achieved a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the US financial system at a range of $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congress delegates have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they may publish and vote on the final text of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services said this to Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, different information is likely to be voted on the plan at the earliest Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication about the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the exacerbation of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "relentation" due to the complex mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package for the stabilisation of the market should look," said Bloomberg to the agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to their words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the Legislatives met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in the night of Sunday to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unallocated mortgage assets from financial corporations, which will cause financial companies to lose serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also significantly settled in the share markets that are decreasing strongly.
The words of the democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, suggest that the legislators are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the convention.
This is the aim of reassuring investors from businesses on the Asian financial markets located in the first time zone, where a decision from the Congress might affect businesses on Monday.
But so far, it is not quite clear when both Chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also unclearness about whether the negotiations in last minute could still fail to have a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will find out some further changes.
The total amount used to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion are to be made as soon as possible as President George Bush demanded.
However, the convention can block the spending of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with additional $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush is positive in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can agree with its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains to be found on the basis of funding for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The representative house should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimate the two-sided effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold fall screens
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading retailer, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden fallscreens for the directors of the companies involved in the programme and to establish a committee to supervise the funds.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also expects with a help for home owners who have problems with repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new councils on mortgages which it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"But because you do not know the mechanism and the price for which the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek considers that it is not crucial.
"It is much more important that the congress delegates agree to support the plan and adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Duell on knife cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 files can play, no MP3 player can call yet.
That is why, of course, it looks like it's better only to buy one phone.
Despite all, there are sufficient reasons for making an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Surely it's hard to buy for home a great expensive record player to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news do not appear on LPs, and for qualitative reasons there is no objective reason.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with the music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floyd fan is probably difficult to rape headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is widely featured.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do they don't even make an expression.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephoning and simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a tiny computer in your bag.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television photograph.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, however, the more often you need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy-freshers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (particularly the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to not be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you call from time to time, you'd better buy yourself another charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even those less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with once charge.
Another problem then exists if you want to overplay the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB finish, and not any mobile phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be done without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves add a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre, or, for example, the review by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can use more
When selecting a specific device, you should consult especially after the lifetime of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the operating comfort.
Is music mainly for you and hears them every day just shortly in the roadway, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You don't have to control the music formats that can be processed by a mobile phone or a player.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is among the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding sites of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can already acquire a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument for why a music phone should be set.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and is usually limited to fast radio heat.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, generally, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most of the cell phones are wearing.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always have headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can react to the integrated speaker, with which almost every cell phone has, but only the least MP3 players.
The most likely advantage of the music mobile phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The largest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically mature telephones with a 3,5-mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is, in turn, in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horroring invoice for data transfers.
What device should you take now
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, you will have two thousand crowns.
But respect.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB storage cards.
If you already want to have a mobile phone and buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to put more than 1100 kroner on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the control comfort comes to the individual MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose phones from Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) offer you MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturer.
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The telephone market in the Czech Republic is well mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all the services they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Still, there is something missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for a long time.
That the Czech mobile telephone providers are working on the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority ČTú, which made it clear that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming fees, there is so likely a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight response.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxous, in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephone providers like to blame for the excessive competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) also often commits Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with his own network has no more special opportunities (and he would probably hardly find spectrums).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market resulted in a significant reduction in prices, which the classic mobile telephone providers had to respond to.
There were similar votes on the market in the UK before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
However, it has shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for long.
In February we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fiveth largest provider in the country.
Behind mobiling, the Penta financial group has U:phone in Czech Republic, among other things.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half a cheaper price than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good shock to put on a non-climbing target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Echt guys choose Mobilking - the provider that they like and which they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, mobile telephone providers are unaffected.
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telephone providers in the Czech Republic are not specially affected by this thought.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything for no potential competitor.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider has been showing the group of GTS Novera who wants to take a further step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business industry.
"We have a great interest in providing our customers not only with fixed networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this option with all Czech mobile telephone providers.
With some of them we were already able to achieve negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an inconsistent wall of silence.
"In this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full-quality virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market shows great specificities to other markets.
We have not yet been addressed by a subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says his Declaration for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srše州 from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Further suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare conformity with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and both-sided project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we must have already had a specific offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses rather on the fulfilment of the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we view from the customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
Mobile telephone providers' operations are easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thereby also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
That the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something, also the long hin and here proves to be the creation of U:fon.
The strongest pressure toward ČTU went from the company T-Mobile when U:fon came to the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition environment of the mobile market was recently also strengthened by the entry into the market by a fourth mobile telephone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, on his services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile telephone providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is amazed.
It is not only the position of the ČTU, which, unfortunately, has no power to intervene in economic competition in Czech countries - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, refers to the entire problem of its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract conclude between a mobile provider and a virtual provider has arrived on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not enough interesting for the classic providers," said in his reply to our question Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formation would not be surprised by representatives of the suppliers.
Of a authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one misuses its position on the market, this is more than questionable.
Particularly when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual providers work normally, it is necessary to observe that their entry on the market has contributed to a reduction in prices in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a lower price is probably not part of the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, the almost touching consensus of the three mobile telephone providers is truly shocking, resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence.
Just as the absolutely equal benzine price at the tank stations is surely only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of action against competition in this matter and has therefore no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also lacking the regulatory authority for telecommunications," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTU, after telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for his network.
It means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a certain segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile telephone providers are considerably acting similarly.
In this context, complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera company mentioned), show that they are confronted with very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The dismantling of responsibilities to the ČTU is then a rather common trick in telecommunications services, which distinguishes the UOHS from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted novelle of the Telecommunications Act has not succeeded in extending the competences of the ČTU to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts of these have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know that only too well, but probably they have other interests.
It's all right if no one looks at
Unrespected remains the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies who issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
It is normally companies who act in the field of multilevel marketing.
For example, own mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears as a classic business customer, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the conditions of use of all Czech mobile telephone providers are prohibiting similar retail sales.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will be discussed, which can lead to a cessation of cooperation with the corresponding society," answered Martina Kemrová our question on this issue.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing does not apply to those responsible for mobile telephone providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
The activities of these companies do not result in negligible profits, while they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
On possible problems, Miroslav Čepický draws attention: "The law allows such kinds of speculations, even though the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot fully have as the normal customers of mobile telephone providers."
But only this would have to happen to the ČTU at least strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the UOHS.
Does mobile telephone providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they locking up against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want it, it does not have to satisfy the declaration of the suppliers, they do not know about it and their conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer expensive
As has been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant decrease in prices in the various services.
In this context, virtually in all countries where virtual providers have been created, classical providers have tried to prevent virtually more or less of their origin.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, in these moments, the regulatory bodies, which did not at all try to preserve the interests of mobile telephone providers, but that of their customers.
If it was by formal measures or by non-formal pressure, they reached the origin of the first virtual operator and followed it further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot discourage the impression that unclearness in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is true and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymn Where is my home country at the day of the Czech State in a celebration hour.
The Hymne was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologic singing, in chorization and in a instrumental version.
The song record took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions at the same time.
The Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already said to the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are significant and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear dictation, so that you can understand the text well so that a consensus can be achieved," said the conductor.
The Czech National Hymn will be its 175th anniversary next year.
In 1834, the song Kde domov měj was the first to play on the stage of the theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first stroke of the song then became an organic part of the national hymn after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What sounds the "new" Hymne?
The Prague transport companies also transport to a chip on Wednesday first
The Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport companies as a date where the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper carrier will enter a subway, road or bus.
These are currently able to buy about a hundred thousand people who have the chip card open card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or a year-coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and be able to play it on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport operations at the U-Bahn stations Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letţany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available via the Internet since yesterday on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper carriers.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places the traveller is also available a switch with trained personnel, who advises the interested in the purchase of the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-controlling machines on the opencard that are fitted in some subway vails.
How do such machines look?
They are red, remembering passengers, the passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská subway stations.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The use of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previous purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 449, mainly the inhabitants of municipalities of the region of Middle Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train companion reader devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal by Ropid's organisation. This organisation compils the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The suburb buses have card readers at the cabinet at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed on a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," said Drápal.
A passenger who doesn't drive buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
This display displays the information on the validity of its documents on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a national decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the inclusion of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South-Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we will at least want to live under the cover of the United States of America.
With such a desire, some groups of Sudeten Germans were supposed to have turned to the US presidents in 1945.
This is evident among other things from a letter that has remained in a private archive and which is stored today in the collections of the South-Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the München agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have really understood the situation and want to be sure that the American units enter into the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as a freer," says a letter signed with the words "Mens who are the fate of the Sudetes at heart".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans – in knowledge of the Czech National Charter – suspected that it would expect brutality, ignorance, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter would ask the American Presidents to take over the boheme for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without considering the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area, you can speak to a foreign state for us, which oppresses and eliminates minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is claimed to be the fear of revenge of the Czech oppressors.
If the U.S. President doubts the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would start a referendum decision in Bohmerwaldgau about whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the rule of protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, some time witnesses believe that it draws a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would be negotiated about their removal from the Republic, only a few of them admitted to such an opportunity at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a type of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa from Budweis.
He was appointed in the war as a Budweis German at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was brought to a war prison camp to Holstein, thousands of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would happen to them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that he would be distributed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotionally loaded campaign is addressed to drivers
The most expensive action for security on the streets in the Czech history.
This also features the emotionally loaded media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The Authority of Minister Aleš 州ebíček promises to take riders of dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, on the film, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the drivers off of too fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
And they also remind you to gorge before riding.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and, in particular, professional drivers in conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" stroke of the entire campaign also shows:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in uppercase letters on a mark.
And in a blood laugh, then the word "pay."
This should mean that you can pay a moment of obscureness with your own life.
The spots will be shocked by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the angel Saksian countries, where normal images can be seen with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It promises that the numbers of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peaches for car drivers
"For the drivers, the motto of sugar bread and peat is applicable.
Sugar bread means they save time, for example when they drive in red.
The whistle is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
He believes that less effective are tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns about a danger, it will probably soon leave with the environment, and the drivers will no longer see it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli Government of Ehud Olmert has stated for the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan hills, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be concluded in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview printed by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to return to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israelian region) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, not wants tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to abstain from part of Jerusalem," said Olmert at the outset of two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister's words, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Templemen and Holy and Historical Places" located on the territorie of the Old Town.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan hills
Olmert spoke for a deduction of Israel from the Golan hills, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan highs," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they need to abstain from to get back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with (Shitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of (Shitic) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister concreted.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a remote bus it is not allowed to circumvent
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers are allowed to run and run on the bus during the ride.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the speaker of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a two-two-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road to the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment for all accidents next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus may also have an accident or a sharp brake in the moment the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
One also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter even with stairs.
If this is not planned in the bus, the travellers must sit.
The student agency's remote buses have no places to stand; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was taken back, and we came to a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet during their ride, if they have their seat," he informed his position.
The law does not know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no law which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of vehicle companions; however, its rights and obligations do not define it," the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product permit also has standing places.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are stairs and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with stairs and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without stairs with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP professional for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no basic problem in the movement of Stewards on a bus.
"In a liquid way of travel, there are little dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulences will come, and the stewardess can hit its head."
"Bryst a bus sharply, however, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter by internal rules," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to break the services
Student Agency offers services from Stewards as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not even consider his profession to be risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the job of the steward is risky, I will strike it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travelers when they arrive.
That would also reduce the cost," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have steward foods, but we're fighting from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not expressed a year ago for Thyden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the event of an accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off from the stand strip without blinking and had locked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collapsed with the right front part with the truck.
That the two spots were sold for the Stewards, Jančura disputed.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to accuse the truck driver.
With a compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the judicial judgment, but it also expects a financial replacement from the debt's side.
A change in law?
Not invisible
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on a bus could bring about a legal arrangement at which a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working over a year.
"This has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport considers the activities of Stewards not to be a significant threat to the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer hopes resting on Frankfurt
The WestLB Board's letter to the staff of the house does not lack great words.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkasse financial group" could arise, says the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable yield in such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incidence to further collapse in the national banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate action ability in a difficult time.
For the WestLB is still under huge pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervision Institute, which has only recently been clarified by the North Rhine-Westphalia Government, calls for time to find a future solution.
Of a link between the Deka bank that has been known to spare cash customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas informed about the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstraße with a country bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which has been held at half of the national banks and the Sparkassen Associations, has instructed the Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The conversations have obviously just started, it is said at the financial site.
The Deka bank, which is one of the most important employers with its 3,000 employees at the Frankfurt financial site, is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka bank could merge with the Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this Trinity.
Nearly had the plans become public, the Hessian government opposed a participation of Helaba.
The two other houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeated thought games about a connection of the Deka bank with national banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about a collaboration with his house.
Independently, however, it seems to be necessary to mature the knowledge that a collapse of the various houses of the public law sector is necessary.
After the Landtagswahl in Bayern is over, first of all, the BayernLB could draw closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If pressure rises to further mergers, the partners will gradually take advantage of it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far had a far better financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, a collaboration with the West LB, the Sparkasse and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85 percent involved in the Helaba, has placed a barbecue at the beginning of the year.
At least stay the North LB.
Such geo-strategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the various business models of each house fit together.
In June, Merl expressed the decisive question of the business model to ensure the future capability of the Landesbanken had not been answered by the German Sparkasse and Giroverband.
At the end, a destruction of the West LB could also be possible, but it was not desirable there.
In fact, in the letter of the Board of Directors there it is spoken of that the House will in any case seek a "total solution".
How this can be brought under a hat with the collaboration of individual units with the Deka bank, will still appear.
The second weekend is known as "Italy Weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with his friend, and so be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Emperor brand, a massively built bearder stands and proves to the approximately 200 October festival travelers, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a knock, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking next to the station Puorta Nuova, starts four buses this evening, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved especially for Italians, in a bus traveling exclusively Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking area, the South Americans already sing alongside their flag, they have celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate feed and a glasses with wide silver beams, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the October Festival, three tours are this year alone.
At night, on the shower every day, at 22.30 a.m. back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary food, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with the emperor beer, broken faithful to the Bavarian cleansing offer, the health insurance and the German-language travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and in wooden churches, some other buses with Italian marks are held on the motorway 8 just before Munich again.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking near the Theresienwiese at half seven o'clock in the morning, the 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final talk, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow button.
This is left "October Fest", in Fractur, along with the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it says running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupied the places in the back of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellows on the same bench, in the room!"
The measurement, crying Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officers show that we're doing good!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone."
Thirdly, "Today evening, find point half eleven again here!" Understand?
And it's going to wear.
On the way, a yellow cap is tied to the trees, to signs and even to the election plate of a large Bavarian people's party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It's the second wildwokening, known as "Italy Weekend".
There are no exact data on figures; the talk is of 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into the beer cells, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munchner Police is strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bayerische Rote Kreuz, which leads a national statistics where the Italians before Britain (about 60 bets) and Austrians (about 80) with some 200 medical services are first placed.
The court is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, underlined Peer Steinbrück's Federal Financial Ministry only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also influences the German banking sector not to be spared from the crisis.
For it has now arrived in the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate (HRE), recorded in Dax, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect from the turbulencies on the markets.
A familiar person said Reuters on Monday that credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only interest the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which the government financer granted money, he had refined itself extremely short-termly - which is now unable to do so because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's spare reserve had decreased by 95 per cent to €2.37 million, and the equity rate had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current yields and net yields from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, the revenues from assets on claims and certain securities and from the resolving of credit refunds fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher yields from refunds on refunds of reimbursements from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the refund of interests in accordance with the tax order and from the business supply for group companies, the profit minus had remained moderate by approximately 16 per cent.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former State Financer had first speculated himself with commercial real estate credits, which had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
The Depfa had become more involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and of the State (PPP) and internationally diversified in private public partnerships.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "a substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss bill, it is quite undefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit allocation under the banks is largely decorated again, since the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio’s short-term refinancing funds each year – approximately 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate communication, the group's funding needs are covered with the credit for a delay and the company is protected from "the influence of the currently largely inoperable international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is heard that the funds secured refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the monetary markets at time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is the hope of shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamics and irregularities of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unlikely that the funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be excluded.
After the bank's insolvency was still before the bank on the late Sunday evening, the at least provisional salvation cannot calm the moods.
The share rate breaks around 75 per cent to €3.30.
However, the bond courses are quite good.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of the post-range bonds are more clearly imposed.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and the durations beyond 2009 are concerned.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds appeared to be a spectacular investment alternative, their value should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the significant exacerbation of the bank crisis and the institution itself, which had taken over the Depfa.
As long as the note banks, governments and less depressed business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely exclusion of pensions can be assumed.
Or it happens, which is currently hardly awaiting anyone to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the sub-state reports, the probability of security has now only become a justified hope.
Especially long-term believers would be able to make some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
In any event, short-term investors can use a final indent to make a loss lecture for future reimbursement tax payments on course gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16th on the first school day at Tachibana High School, the girls start looking: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before school, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I didn't go away.
The start of teaching at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as in our home in Niedersachsen.
The students came in from eight o'clock until about twenty before nine a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was about to imagine.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, nor the one in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I've dressed an old rock of my host mother, with blossoms, blue knee strips and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself before the scene and tried to express everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started learning the language some two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all twisted, cracked and caught and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nevery, sweet'.
Then I'm quickly in my place.
The girl next to me greeted quite wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong kicked, I was quite disturbed.
Everyone talked and kichered and asked me holes in the stomach - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of her bentos then packed out.
My hostmother had made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the devastated German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, little worsts, salad of gurks and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly, I don't have a blurry shimmer, what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely newly.
It's clear that everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plumbs, maybe, Brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a self-prepared bento to a boy, which she makes especially artificial - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the break talk.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this, too.
'Why calculated Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and the culture in it, I've even started learning some Japanese.
So for me, it was quite clear that I had to go here sometime.
Because I also have a fee for tradition, morals and practices.
And that's what you put great value on here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep flee in danger means that she feel fear too?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they act similarly as we do?
The Internet journal " Edge" has published contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without that I or anyone else could prove this to date where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply to other species and tailor issues of feeling or generally to consciousness, we enter immense areas because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: she gets dead, flies or attacks.
People act similarly, and some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side prefrontal cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This wide area is much higher developed in humans than in the remaining primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness depending on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic character may be in the language nature of man: Since so much of his experience is linked to language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness was not dependent on language, they would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may have been created, probably differed very much from most of our consciousness conditions.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may appear in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, neither measuring nor, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research poses major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that might be more scientifically accessible.
You could examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration for their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
However, in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the neural correlate of consciousness is rather than the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the condition of visualisation.
What is now the result of the feelings?
I bring them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear in a conscious brain of his own activity is activated.
So what we call fear is the mental condition in which we are, when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) has been demonstrated in memory.
Thus, feelings are closely bound to the regions of the Cortex, which are the primates and especially the people.
As linked to the language nature, fine grades of feelings occur because we can differ and categorize with the help of the words and grammar conditions, in order to attribute them to others alongside us.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focusing on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can be very involved in cross-border feelings.
Theoretically, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unproofable.
Panceep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, is likely in both cases the same: How can you check if rats and people feel the same if they act similarly?
A sheep runs in danger if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavior similarity cannot prove any equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and people have similar brain stems, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to humans, how would you prove it with rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I would rather investigate the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are progress at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
As I do not investigate language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I don't know whether they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than keep running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionist.
Uefa President Platini: Gnadenfrist for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunc said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM with Poland," said Wasjunc.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are hanging afterwards.
The number of EMs may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We have to work at maximum speed now," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association of PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and has been replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We insured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not be suffering."
Several first-persons had been sentenced in the past season alone for manipulation to compulsory decline, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Emperor Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in the interview about private things - and now has trouble with the Ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outet her profan Dennis Quaid as adulterer.
He's shy - and he's hitting back.
Late Rosen War at the Ex-Pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players are now carrying out a disgusting dispute - in the public.
In an interview with the U.S. journal InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had first expressed the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has not been experienced until after divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable" is it, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "I for the repeated time the story of our relationship is re-cooking and consuming."
It is also "sorry" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again "remembered in public the pain and revolts that mean divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become the father of Twillingen.
And so closes his invitations with the side hook: "My life goes on anyway.
I appreciate myself having a wonderful family that's fine."
Decrease prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights were cheaper in Europe than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany became even more than 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable – this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant breakdown in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the nights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities investigated increased by a average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were about 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most evident trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year ago.
As a result, American Express sees the weak dollar course, which led to a "decreasing lust of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a rise of 26.3 per cent.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed up at the flight prices:
Due to the cereosinvasion, travellers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the prices for air tickets of the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, however, in the Business and First Class, the price changes were far lower.
In Germany, prices broke even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halfed.
The company explains that the reason for price breakdown is, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth.
The demand in many segments of the flight market is broken.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of tension are the strike of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that have registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to find an operational elf.
By Kristoffer Small Enlarge Brush Landing for National Player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came late in the game and failed with a lifter to the Latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went convincingly about his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," caught Hermann Rieger in the cabin hall of the Hamburg Arena.
A lot wasn't loose in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most of them sat back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of the HSV physicist, enjoying a higher reputation than some of the blasphemed actors.
And so his request also found a hearing on a responsible place.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and agreed with the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
This command will have sounded similarly: Here with gate two!
The implementation remained abandoned.
"There wasn't a good look at everything today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "relaxing".
The 1:0 (1:0) are due to the Hamburger headball match of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol assembled.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves once on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class primus.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to arrange this," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tableary interconnection certificate is more for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late commitments - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torskytter Petric and the Jansen, which is rejected by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but it is not able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the voting downwards
On the Wall Street, fear is about.
First messages from the failure of the rescue package let the Dow Jones interrupt at a time by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got something back.
At 20:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer was recorded by about five percent in the minus at 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The largest loser was at this time in the Dow American Express, who had almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No track could win.
The stocks of the Bank Goldman Sachs gave up about 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage papers are intended to be provided.
But the sum is to be paid, not on a strike, but gradually.
On the contrary, the State should receive share option certificates of financial corporations which could be resolved during the corresponding course development in order to reduce the burden on the government cash.
Share courses in Europe and the United States in downwards
The billions of aids for banks in Europe and the United States do not resolve the doubts of investors.
The stock course of the German Great Bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and rips the Dax downwards.
The US Dow Jones index loses despite the government's planned saving of the financial market.

The Dax stood clearly under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into the knees.
The Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollars heavy saving package of the US Government could not be sufficient to bring back the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent at 10.809,25 points in the first trading hour.
The US Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first gave up by 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11.743.61 counters.

Dark Matter affects flight from space zones
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused inconsistency: Dark matter affects the speed of space sins during so-called Swing-by-Manöver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years the space sun "Ulysses" flew through the space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel pipelines, you are now threatening the cold death.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is an airmanöver of space sins, where they receive additional vibration in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as the earth.
This allows the sins to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Zone of Cassini-Huygen used this physical trick as well as the sun of Ulysses.
But what the researchers have been wondering for years: the air carriers do not act 100 percent as expected after the aged gravity law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The sins become unexpected faster or slower.
So far the physicians have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts are afraid that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by crumbling the space, may not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and attempts to explain the Swing-by-Anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made out in the universe.
"Responsible for anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
Apparently, it is an attractive force whose effect can be seen on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter still constitutes a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists slaughtered in Egypt are supposed to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In case of a shooting before release, six hostages were supposed to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solution negotiations are already in progress.
Germans repeatedly come to the Visier of Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are evidently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV broadcaster Al-Arabia and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed release as reported by the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We are just checking their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are well-equipped and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are supposed to be already on the way to Cairo.
Unclear remains the foundations of a shooting before the release of hostages: therefore, according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers had been ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It had been "only about taking the hostages into receipt" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros by Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling for a German intermediary, delaying the release of hostages because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the report, kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe runway.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "found suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six - year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied her and joined her eyes before he committed sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a hospital.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time officially for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
State prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and "had given up her life"
In April 2007 her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by embroidering through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter, which ended: "I used to tie her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for their death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have been ignored before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I notice the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her act had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data are accused of
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be accused of the "public security law".
The man was delegated from the Defense Ministry when he lost two very confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no sign of criminal intent.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said that the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would take place internally at the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be accused of in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the officials be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he delivered contained classified evaluations on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Accommodation building companies see B&B costs in the eye
Britain's housing companies could be in the house after the saving of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
The interests for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
Adrian Coles, the Director-General of the Association of Accommodation Societys (BSA), said that it was "inexistent" that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are abolished.
However, the interest rates collected in the meantime are calculated each year by the 700 financial undertakings accepting deposits.
The financial service compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that the institutions who have acted carefully ... are now called on to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interests for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies have to obtain 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Accommodation Societys, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that the institutions who have acted carefully during the real estate recovery are now called on to carry some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
The interest rates falling in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building companies are both sides of organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the gross market price of his milk by five more pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting company have been carried out.
The retailers are supposed to decide themselves whether they want to transfer the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the large market price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied
A court in Bangladesh rejected a deposit request by former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defendants said that the Court of Caution refused to have extorted 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating accusations for corruption against them.
Scheich Hasina's long-year-old political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released in the beginning of this month against caution.
Sheich Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first give her unlimited freedom.
The correspondents say that even though her arrest was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release that she will be able to stay on the free foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers argue that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Scheich Hasina's caution bid because it says that she has not to be granted a deposit, since she is already on a postponement abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will notify a legal problem against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need a deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare themselves for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but in June she had been released from prison to go to abroad for medical treatment.
Sheich Hasina, and Khaleda Zia, deny all the charges against themselves.
Fears about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
The United Nations said that almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated in the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case despite the Taliban promise that the thousands of vaccinating employees would not attack or halt the vaccination.
BskyB loses appeal in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing transmitter ITV.
The Competition Recruitment Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and enabled it to have an unfair influence on the ITV transmitter.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by renamed NTL to Virgin Media successfully preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of ITV’s share would cause doubts about ITV’s independence, which moved the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Agency have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing its share of ITV would be an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced to want to give up his voting rights.
New inquiry in the U.S. State Prosecutor
The U.S. General Prosecutor has instructed a special detective to consider the dismissal of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Director-General of the Ministry of Justice, criticizing the actions of administrative staff.
The report criticized the officials of the Weissen House, the lawyers and the former General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers were discontinued for political reasons.
The Special Detective Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials who were interrogated during the investigation have lied to the detectives to obstacle to justice.
Serious accusations including criminal proceedings have not been fully examined or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The call for a special detective with the power to force the Witnesses to state was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice took off nine US prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak labour benefits.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors were not worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others refused to examine the accusations of election fraud of democracies.
U.S. prosecutors are instructed to investigate and persecute judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but they must not be discontinued for political reasons.
The then Head of the Ministry of Justice, Advocate General Alberto Gonzales, has been dismissed and has established his office in the final effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also dismissed.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector addressed the role of Gonzales critically by carrying the "main responsibility" for the releases, "resigning" his leadership and "exceptionally interested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former principal advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the researchers.
Meat Loaf's epical song should be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is intended to be honored during the musical prize "Q Award" for his epical hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, next week in London, will accept his special golden price during the award, said that he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" indicates the nominations for the pricing this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief actor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" would certainly be one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared in 1979 as single in Britain and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold himself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeat after he had crashed on the stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyste on his voice band.
Obscure road in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, lonely roads, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others are only convenient.
Yet, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents to say where extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and goes from the First Street direction north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks for a dust gate rather than for an active roadway.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
Still, this road has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants to replacing Extra Place to create a clean journey to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
One of the other worshipers is the long-term neighborhood that says that it is fascinated by the short gas, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and responsible for the road has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipality this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipality 3.
"Not much space has remained in possession of the city and we want extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road replacing and setting up seats, among other things for a café that the company wants to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost gas and make it a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed sales.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the building protection department, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the road and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the property rather than to manage.
Compared to his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road had its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a close land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmal, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as the scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scraps, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some inhabitants, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremia's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of complaints: a bitter nostalgic view of the extinct city") published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sack gas that remains even dark every day and is characterized by roasted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rainfall passing flights of weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and a empty bottle of beer on the ground was not far from a fresh set of senior newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished something.
Fields, added that he believes that some people underestimate the irritation of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Debate on two-language training: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in Californian studies and director in the field of educational science at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a fellow author of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school choice".
The Hispanic voters are a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign mentioned that "the probability for African and Hispanic students to complete the school is lower than for white students" - which is true.
In order to close this performance distance, Obama's education plan recommends, in particular, a two-language transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether his use of two-language training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance to school services.
Consider the example of "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in Eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are Hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, of whom many have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Yet, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students in mathematics had a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were considered good in the English examination.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those prefered by Obama.
The School of Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a position that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach for training in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly what Obama is supposed to observe, says school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach depends on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the professional class.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of two-language training, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English learning students?
The benefits of the school would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national image ununions have long supported the idea of two-language training) and its own consistent support for two-language training makes predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take carefully into account education models that function instead of despise and trivialize them.
The oil price declines as a result of new anxiety about the economy
On Monday, the oil price was greatly declined because of the fear that even the American saving plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revive the economy.
The raw oil shops at the New York Trade Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has decreased by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, goods markets have been shocked by both the financial turbulences on the Wall Street and by strong spinal storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors had been worried again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on the weekend to a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns about the fact that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup will buy up the bank transactions of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems not possible to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analyticals of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus spreads worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Crew record by series in the second quarter
Indoor defense Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been more frequent than anyone else in the Jets Triot in the past eight and a half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets transformed a resultless game into a triumphary.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
After a dirty game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year touchdown, this marked the perfect start to a afternoon where their developing collaboration made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one once as an outdoor defense and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't worked very hard," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catches, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defendant Darrelle Revis began a disappointed throw and transformed it into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and took it off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On both answers, because the Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without reaching one one, Mangini said, "Tro me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Extended brusselassia strikes its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think of it as the best long-term runner ever after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who has achieved the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, thus set up his 26th world record in its versatile career, in which he at least reached a world championship title or set up a world record on each route from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie exposed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear which may have been exaggerated afterwards that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - brewery has won an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya, the record time for Marathon has fallen over the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie announced to the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago, so he could not train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and didn't get stuck back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I took the training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end, something great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively organizing his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars generally, relying too much on the racers, as if it were a rail race, and setting world records on the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of fertilizers as long-term runners.
Following four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite drivers from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the tempo makers had left behind.
Somewhat more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made its last entry to separate from Kwambai, which as the second arrived in 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikietko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all times at 2:19:19.
The World Record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won surprisingly the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon at five minutes.
She has planned her course in order to remove a quartet from Ethiopic and Kenian women , but after 30 kilometers .
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strife in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special nature
Hidden between the developments of the recreational parks in the surroundings of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and giant drives, a quiet city in which pride and complications of African American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocheting places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that it describes is and remains – which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of the depression by the federal writer project – in many ways a place of special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, digged and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what's wrong with him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion about race relationships, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a municipal member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville was for a long time defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a high-burg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the southern rural region, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that inhabitants here are both proud and watchful.
And as correctly the concerns about Eatonville's Image actually began with Zora, as here all called Hurston.
She presented the world her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in the mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leader changed the city very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as Oskar, both in real life and in literature, led Hurston Reader to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Apart from the road to the left," she wrote, "the brown -wisely stroked modern school, with its cared gardens and playgrounds to which Howard Miller always cares, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells every kind of drinks and what-always fits to hours rooms."
In only a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls foregoing the Hurston, quoting the men who sang the songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual acts.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
There is still a reminder of Hurtson as a lively excentrician who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston broke into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoked and dressed with pants, in a city that presently represents something on its honorable dressing style.
According to Mr Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while he shake in his chair, on a backward terrace looking at the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Together with the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary woman of Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was accompanied in a anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida.
In Eatonville there were no big memorials, no public readings in large style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or her inheritance," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to place a five-tracked motorway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-tracked main road of the municipality.
Orlando's prey had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, including, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time a lot of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the absent people," said Mr Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed there.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955 Hurston in a letter to Orlando Sentinel asked the Supreme Court of Justice to force integration by calling its decision against the School Council in the case of Brown as "political rather than respecting my race".
Today, inhabitants say that although the abolition of racial separation in some respects was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Black children were used to be embraced - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathhiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business director of the commonly useful group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and pupils no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathhiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who disregarded prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker took herself on the way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her glory.
Five years later, a very praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the book shelf and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The highway project came precisely at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-tracked remote road lived in the city, accelerated the whole with high speed, raised real citizenship," said Mrs. Nathhiri.
Mrs Boyd made it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There came more and more trainers, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-stage library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly plotted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special place in Florida: only 6 miles from the town center of Orlandos, it can sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as it was then founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is black at 90% today.)
Outstanding in search of Eatonville's history and its importance are still often treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in front and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church painted by a Weiss and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, foolish and mixed as any other race and national group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police, which, accordingly, could need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just go through here will think: "Well, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we speak a flowing financial latine.
At first view, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge television screens in the Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shock-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopole in New York daily have the worst horror work day since the stock exchange crash of 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea walls along citizen climbs and transporting tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallows between apartments, as human packed animals load with about 50 bridged T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like bar on their shoulders.
Officers still wait for the citizen's food stands on their breakfast bar and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a week's day between 16 and 19 p.m.
It did not feel like a crisis until I decided Thursday afternoon because of all the world's underground talk to open up a new saving account.
Although I had decided to place my duty course at the time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branch, about 20 people were already in the snake.
Not to the cash switches to pick up or pay money, but to the customer service bar where the customers order checkbooks, tourists asking for the way to Macy's purchase house and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "private banking staff with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already spared their spares from smaller banks, where they were penetrating from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had abolished money from so-called Trykts (a little like a building parking pool), cooperative banks and the local savings boxes that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers as family.
Last year 15 of these banks have gone quietly and silently.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy and as the last Friday New Yorker, Wachovia, another bank, which has stores of $440 billion, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and shop workers who claimed to be in front of me brought their bars to a bank that is considered to be a safe port, a bank responsible for most sales purchases at the Wall Street.
Normally, New Yorkers have fitted a flowing financial latine in the last few weeks.
A woman who was calling in my Chinese strait supermarket, with so much confidentiality referred to Lehman Brothers, the pledge went bank, and their outstanding Chairman Dick Full, who looked out like she would read over a ugly colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old unified Concierge of my living block, has escaped from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going into risks anymore."
Muslim graves disgraced during a legal rural in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-handed of the Austrian Rights Free Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 in order to represent the organization of " cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is depicted, stroked with a red line.
Police accuses legal extremists of the funeral in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, which at the same weekend at the extremely right parties represents considerable profits in the election of the country's parliament.
In the night from Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun at Linz were severely damaged in an organised action, according to the police.
The transgressors sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials think that this is an attempt to cover the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way related to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said that they were "the deepest shocked" about the message of the grave harassment, which took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan turns to the end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country went right in the parliamentary election yesterday.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, who received the nearly 30% of the votes, were in their election campaign for a strict anti-migrant law, and some of their elections were criticised by opponents as foreign enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the voices, took up a ban on headwear and Burkas and even announced his disownment against foods that were generally associated with Islam.
In his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" that prevents Islam's growth.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of Mosheen and Minaretten with the argument that these political symbols are a continual islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Inquiries and analyses carried out directly after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been condemned by children's sexual abuse, was judicially prohibited to travel to France and Spain.
Judges placed a six-month restriction on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent were granted to imprison a foreign travel block last Thursday after she presented evidence of glitters prejudice for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
EIn Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police requested Kent at the Ashford Office to prevent abroad travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't personally present."
According to the register for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He has to notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
Missing the notification of the authorities could lead to a five-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or glitters possible place of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual criminals in the country to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he had to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport control and he flew to some of them to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he would return to Great Britain.
Lastly, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22th, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Court of Justice of Uxbridge in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval to require him to register as sexual criminals.
Glitter had been imprisoned for four months in the United Kingdom before 1999 because of possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Inner Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no no noises, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flame cotants who fail to concentrate and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are strangers of the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or expression strength of hands that are worried because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-People', German photographer Günter Bauer represents changing theatralics of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco rendering at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of the photography of Flamenco ` reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows increasingly from day to day', explains to the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists that are able to communicate on the stage passion, sadness, joy, and thus move the audience.
To hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the biggest flame comeisters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the available material, images developed that remind of classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and amaze each day'.
This is not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who, with his art, seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of Hiss, is and was the firm goal of this work that will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to reappear this idea two years ago and to achieve it as 'Portrait of the veterans of the sport' ('SportART Project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a lot of pleasure to photograph the people, to get to know them and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult family.
You meet or hit people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realise my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco of today with the title `Flamenco-People' is exhibited in the El Fotomata gallery, which is located in the street named la calle de la Mata and is parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is "a tollness".
He still doesn't know where the Roman's action is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is continuing to try to move forward the project at which he is just working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prizeholder admitted that the project he is busy with is "a tollness" and `all suggests that he should not write the novel'.
`If I had thought, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at any time', so he closed his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and which most attendants give their voice, is compared with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre of Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his call for literature originated from 'exceptional adventure', from 'Rejoy on reading' and from 'more than before'; how he writes and keeps `Disziplin' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intense work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions that he does; like Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas affected his appeal and which 'Remember images' it forms the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American Roman writer admitted that there's no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a refugee experience', he stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it's producing effects' and 'the people even more dismantling', so I asked the writer 'such of lightness not to leave' and 'take responsibility' for his call 'over'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighters were partially out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight feast, with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be completed, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus the organiser, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bullfight feast.
Thus the festival was suspended for the inconsistent weather, so two out of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday, it was rainy that the second predicted bullfight feast could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bull fightfarena.
It was only a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded more by galops than by his struggling art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large majority of the audience reacted in his second fight with buh ropes.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hash.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the district of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen urged the drivers of the car to stop, where they took the escape.
It seemed that they had not to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hash.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as the Basque State Interior Ministry announced.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and falsehood of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Transport Police of the Region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the Armiñon district.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the border. At the moment the drivers came out of the car to flee through a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was enforced by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hash bands, which were later guided to accurate laboratory analysis and to weigh the batch to other police services.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was `doublet' so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the Kfz papers, and therefore, additionally, an arrest was made for false documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to take the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the drug insulated.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was brought to a police office for hearing and will be presented to the prisoner in the next few hours.
The actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
A Witness has observed how she tried to ride out of her parking gap in Montecito in a strange way, speakers of the California Transport Police reported to the magazine `People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear was pressing through the Gaspedal after 16:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking hole, and when she went backwards, she grabbed a few times on her sunglasses.
A little later, the Witness, who at the beginning probably hadn't realized that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the emergency service because she had "fear for Locklear's life".
When the police line arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
`She seemed unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress was shown cooperatively, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation at 7:00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was dismissed from the hospital in Arizona, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the principal coordinator of the United Left and United Left Members, has assured today that the regional association for education will be the ones who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the Council House in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had retired last week after being accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it', Llamazare pointed out the way the party must have to do with the person who is now the city Council in the municipality of Sevilla.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the FL defended the need for "transparency" in the possible investigations of the rules infringements that Silva might have started: "The FL always insisted on such cases to obtain the maximum transparency".
On this subject, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Garci's heroic book
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French. This is a fantastic film in the filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for turning work.
In this way, the cineast tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the beginning of a long catalogue of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinema and later shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this work his 'Kinderheitstrum' was fulfilled. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him from the autonomous community of Madrid to turn a memorial film to the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2, in particular because the story was based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous Community of Madrid offers Garci, as he added, the 'once-time opportunity' with the help of decorations and similar clothing, the picture of 'conflicted Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been resurrected by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the cineast regrets that the funding of Alatriste or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo') was not expected, so some scenes from the drawing book with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a Empezar', contributed to his ordinary work: he stood on the stage to the actors with which you first have to try before you start turning and for those who had not made casting, he appeared 'degrading' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry where you work.'
Many actors he meets in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (which he won one of) is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor even the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you're working for the descendant, later you notice that it's only for the descendant, and now you're satisfied if you have produced another film', explains Garci after more than 30 years of occupational activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencotzer from Sevilla worships a dancer who also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana quarter and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert on Oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistine, vegetarian, and sat down for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between wars.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role that seemed impossible to me.'
`We don't try to tell her about her life without keeping her esprit,' the Flamenco dancer said.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the butterfly seemed like Guajira, or the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dance was meaningful and it has been told me that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The stage is expected with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who would exceptionally work with one of her ex-schoolsters.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The scene also expects the musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with actors Juanfra Juarez, he's taking over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he was always in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
`I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular epoch and whose works are no longer known today and therefore they are less appreciative', says Bayón.
The show will take place today at 20:30 in the Theatre of Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the literature nobel prize and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the course of the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This set comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in `Sensation Reporter', and from the prevailing idea of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all the Americas to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Now, look what she cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, it was a great battle for everyone.
`What a person sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, 'my life and my country were the biggest stupidities of his life.'
No one was afraid not to ridicule or overdrive himself.
As a `father' of the cinema and the country of the father, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and of market breakdown prevails, in which the depressed self-respect of the US Americans on hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity is.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people you can admire, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he represented a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses, both profits: from the foundation, which has described to combat drugs, and to the honor of his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to fight a mortal nutrition culture.
A wide wave of amazement strikes haushoch to take over Hollywood without considering nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died but all the era.
The Englisher Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize manager, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the largest of us all', George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of few who are trusting today trying to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high demands for justice, providing a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He was divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?', he often joke himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
`From all the great roles he played, he was as proud to none as the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the Philanthroph', they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was described as the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to observe the evaluation and I could check it, it would clearly not have been done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The asshole starts with the ticket pick that allows you to go as the first.
It seems not bad too, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the steam on the road).
So don't.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first fool that is to go there only) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second fool because I need the size of XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it true that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material?
All right, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Except that you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, too, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is unbelievable in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was expected, the road began and we had not left our backpacks ahead, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it was temptation to organise a folk resurrection and to attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time in classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the output has been wrongly stamped.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, this road would never be in my mind.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft it is a route planer to move to the campus of the company).The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this `Receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, listen to it, and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also organize the attendants in the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads to its conversation and that no company employer is either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon listen.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week it was very surfacely talked about Microsoft's change in strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most needed instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that's just for the few.
Everything is only a detection if you consider Microsoft adding some function in Windows versions and `Extras'.
The change in direction is worth
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually of importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Certainly many suggested that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to informing his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his `Death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People give less attention every time to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and we spend more time each day on browsing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
For what is half of existing applications used in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without any doubt. I'm giving a little example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing beverage machine, a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online searches.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google used for research on the network.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously to the mark.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blud Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is part of the clothing of a well built parish.
When we start listing the countless Stars performances, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, with a spitting bark that had raised gravity weights in a hiking circuit.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, flavourless and tailed.
The English speakers call it tank, but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, even though she is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name-up is linked to sports and came from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overrides everyone because of his excellent cotton, because of his distinct unisex cut, and characterizes itself by a small Belgian flag (cautionally recognized) that have these T-shirts as detail on the neck cut.
And respect, the Belgian company is not focused only on the production of tanks.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmirs, Hoses of Cotton, T-shirts with strips, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use it as a subcloth.
You're very exciting.
`I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicious, but full of life joy.
At present, the brothers and sisters Gruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, transferred to its residence and also the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsor the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in dinner for Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, I'm both fascinated by the film of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women dressed as they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe yes, but finally, everything meets in one, and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was a child, I was enthusiastic with the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to shake around my aunt’s garments and see her clothes.
It was great to go nearly better than to go to a recreational park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in teaching and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel well.
As a actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
You've recently become 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, something.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was young, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think of being a mother, isn't it?
For a long time I have known that I will be a mother because this requires my body and also I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I'll give my child great feelings of happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
With regard to film art, you keep in your eyes the work you have participated in and the last year have been played.
That is the same way, and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from theater, am very impatient and unrest and wants to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago you appeared on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Okay, don't say something like that.
It's not that I went on the walk to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has just called and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the well-being event of her organization `women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango were decorated to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things to be told about her, and I, when the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this graceful thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
The drivers who can be retarded due to the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver who had three official punishments for the alcohol level installed in his car this system, which forbids him to start the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not jump.
The initiative was announced in the last month in June and is now part of the report of the Advocate General State, which, according to its information, is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The aim is to resozialize the driver, which is why he receives a course for retraining transport behaviour.
Except for the General State Prosecutor, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Cars will participate.
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the car drivers who have been shown more than once because of the driving under alcoholic influence, re-taxed.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart if the driver has made a alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65 % of the infringements already in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is expected that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is restricted to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take this behaviour into action before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be achieved in the usual ways, and still a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some public transport vehicles and vehicles.
The House of Members will be voted tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-tos'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the president of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but their beams have still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal pair that went out of the plane.
Direct on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there can be no people at the airport at this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
-Oh, so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who is the prince and the prince of Asturia and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting at the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection from 27 Marine soldiers who are giving honors.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair waved by the wind, without ordinary `peep-tos', might have been told her that it is expected to be a thunder in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are stayed, one of the four largest in the city, waits for her a reporter from the Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of the mode
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded at a monetary price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the Mango branch window at Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken by pain because his brother recently died, rips together. He dressed the dress from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH that were breathtaking. He stayed on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a cavalry, so he ended with the baron of Redschild without jackets, because Jacketts they borrowed to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has hurried to the business and had a trouser and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she carried a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a stack and made a kind of `ground plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always causes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the staring sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There's no 1000, but one way more to forget chaotic us fast everyday life.
And even if there are few, all are gathered in a book in which it says how to relax. The book comes into the book deals on September 30th.
The waker is a punishment when he rings at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life.
The office is the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems that can be avoided from the working world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga statements, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott represents in the book the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 ways to relax' and thus the tranquillity that the book provides comes into the book deals by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks that it is impossible to reach the rest in such areas as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual contradicts such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenalin no longer rises up in your veins to restore the body's balance and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn the brain off and focus on reading.
Talk in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children speaking during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality, it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Sure, more than one of you were told you talked at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (e.g. once in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (each day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason that causes this appearance.
Often, associations with other appearances in the sleep are searched, such as nightmare, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bednaces at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fibres, stress situations or excesses.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to watch the child and to be consulted by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and is thus achieved.
We have said it is a positive disturbance, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. sleep apnoe or stress).
What can be done is to carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children whose relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them to get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs once in sleep, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to let yourself be consulted or to find out the reason for the child’s fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child is not under pressure to carry out a hearing and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve it because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they should be careful with the interpretation of information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirsty route, Illhouses on the playground are finally back on success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous Torchances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers were struggling to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot almost passed at the angle, Illhouses should easily dominate the game, and it was only possible to switch Fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the top of the foot, to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing crew blocked in the field center and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two Torchances fought by Riahi and temporary, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the malicious port shooter should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his teammates had to continue to play countlessly lower.
Denmark, however, did not exploit this and did not face any major problems of an illhaeus elf, which only took a little back in order to defend their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big break.
Sarkozy meet wrathful fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another stepping to the Bretagne.
In view of the decisive attitude of the fishermen blocking access to several Bretonian and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to enter the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him with a constructive spirit, and hopes that he will come with "concrete proposals".
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was founded by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of over EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them in order to help their companies to become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of sailors.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with decisiveness.
On Tuesday morning, they led in Morbihan and Calvado's protest march, which caused stitch of nearly ten kilometers of length.
The seal port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
Quiberon island was confined with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors gave their determination expression by burning tyres and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Ermkanal, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not drive out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manöver of trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the responses to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
For example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, declared that the strike will continue, because the fishermen will not give up at any point and do not want to go to Paris.
The occupational fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel costs the litre at present about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.

Embraer maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot of the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size from 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, who was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, considers spending more than 15% of its assets to pay back the $85 billion that was proposed to him.
AIG is willing to charge the sale of a large part of its business, beyond their international life insurance and their age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday night to verify possible sales.
No confirmation was achieved at the AIG.
One of the assets of which AIG may be divorced is their aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the re-insurance transatlantic holdings, as well as its real estate and investments in the private equity, the FT continues.
With regard to this sale, no definitive decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG must operate at the fastest of its sales to pay back the loans over 85 billion which it has granted the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost at the same level.
Analysis Historical Paris of Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Representative Chamber had rejected Paulson's plan for the salvation of the banks, a historic case of course: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and afternoon 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on September 17, 2001, the day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final figures, the afternoon index, mainly with regard to technology, was dropped by 199,61 points to 1.983,73 and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan for the salvation of banks by the Chamber of Members, which should allow for some stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which was already attacked at the beginning of the quarter, collapseed.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 Members refused the funds he had asked for to be rejected to the Secretary of Finance.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here is a bad picture that represents the Congress as unable to adopt a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come too late.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (American Central Bank, Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more," Brian Bethune, economic head of Global Insight, warned.
And Miss Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency even more, `that is the ruin of a financial company in the United States' every day that ends.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned the purchase of the bank transactions of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets are not only a American but a global crisis, the FTN Financial Analytist added.
The market for basic needs has grown strongly.
The revenues of the government cash within ten years have decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, victory by points in the first television show
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday, another one followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show, which should be persecuted by one third of the American families.
The political analytist David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, even though very considerable, was not `brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election surveys five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a opinion survey was published on Saturday, says Obama has five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democracy clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecisive voters, so the ones on which it is now, Obama came out with 39% as the winners of the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, the McCain views 25% of them as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rivalin Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy in the forefront, and clearly underlined the 'naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television show.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being released.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image of the world from the United States.
`McCain has still not understood Obama', on the other hand, this weekend a democratic advertising spot in which the Republican was proclaimed not to have recorded the complete extent of the crisis that is charged on the 'American from the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama struck last night 20,000 people who had gathered in streaming rain at a election event in Northern Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'Medium Stand' or 'Workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans think is most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The next week could be a decisive turning point', appreciated yesterday the influenceful democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton Government, compared the good economic instincts of Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After again stressing that he would even be able to reduce taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the variations at the Wall Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, had the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are considerately exercising the questions that were addressed to the financial market rescue plan over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted yesterday evening by the convention and is extremely unpopular to the people.
'Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositional demonstrated Sunday night at the main place of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Some hundred White Russians assembled Sunday evening since closing the election rooms at the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of Parliament's elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should withdraw'.
Some admit that they haven't elected at first: `What's useful if they do with my voice what they want', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown foreign observers in the best light to reopen negotiations with the European Union is willing to carry out a democratic turn.
The penalties, including the non-distribution of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposing of certain assets, could be repealed if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown', regretted Juri Potemkin, press speaker of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous fusion of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and this is the executive in us.
If Members move the opposition into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty to intervene in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
For if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, is incurred in a crisis and we do not reform, we are at the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the course of elections, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It stresses that the numbers of elections appear too high and that the extension of the voting fee in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has provided the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, those who best comply with the government's views.
The silence of the night goes back over the October Square.
In television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all the reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the confidence of the public, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation initiated by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drawing up directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitating to submit his report, several provinces at that time put a committee on their feet, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee of Gélineau fulfilled this assignment.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, only 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was discouraging.
By the huge efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and by working in this field in the following years, we have regained the confidence of the public', she says before she proudly stresses that at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps conscious of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of bovine wheat in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
`And we had no idea if this disease could be transferred over blood.
So we call on one of the main directives of the Crever and Gélineau reports, which, according to exclusion measures, are applied if you do not know this and if a disease progresses slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So, in April 1999, no blood was accepted by people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease is transmitted over blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the donor to demonstrate the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood, and not the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used to date.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood preserves should be distributed before someone gets HIV.
Since hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case where HIV was transmitted via a blood conservation.
I believe that today you can feel good when you get or write a blood transfusion to recover health," says the Head of Director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to obtain the safety of our products.
You never know what disease agents can get into the system.
Only last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus appeared, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to keep track of it, Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supply in addition to safe supply.
`The need increases because the population ages.
Since treatments for cancer control are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which, on average, only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants are suitable for blood donation.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the fitness criteria can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are ill with AIDS or malaria, and who are travelling to a country where malaria is spread, is excluded from blood donation for a year.
`With these 3% we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network when they grow older and can't give blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Life is so heavily today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour spending on blood', regrets Francine Décary.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec does not only provide blood conservations but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart beats, eye apples and skin, which are used almost exclusively in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel blood bank of Quebec.
In the navel snor, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is a rich blood of stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
` A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth navel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand each year.
`We should start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary continues, who describes this program of navel cutting blood as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced that they have no access' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finale
Montreal's Impact took place yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-winning (4 to 3 with all the gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decides to play the fourth-final series in the Saputo Stadion, where the total port ratio was qualified for the half-final round of the excretion games of the first League of USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetyth minute of the game.
After a first half time without gate for both the one and the other, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember, during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1-degradation.
In the semi-final, Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 victories, but the Whitecaps moved with a total port ratio of 5 to 4 to the half-final round.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian crew is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn developed the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport into this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparation games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel good.
`He fixed himself too much on it in the first half time, noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause.
Charest places on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude the initiation of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) attempts to be elected in today's partial election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual resources at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of water power plants, mines, Quebec viewed in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the election period.
In contrast with the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he had made it clear that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area' that provides an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited itself to explain why the North is a jewel with enormous potential, but no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the future projects.
At least some prospects of what could be done more: especially in the water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of threshold countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charests, the north has `Nickckel, Zink, Copper, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan and even Diamant'.
This `area is twice as large as France'' is in our vicinity, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us, he stressed how to demonstrate clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founder space.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put a theatral break to view the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always invited, explained to the Prime Minister of the Press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, if the opportunity is available, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he explained.
In addition, 'with climate change we need to reconsider our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be travelable the whole year due to the ice melt.
In this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the inhabitants and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very careful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (predominant Pekist Member of Ungava) have already initiated discussions in some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee directed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Ground Treasures) takes an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will remain in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan Nord will be discussed, regulated and environmentally decent, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in the front of him.
`As the liberals who were in the office before us, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new growth and development gaps.
This was, by the way, one of the topics that were repeatedly raised in the weekend, which was opened by Jean Lesage on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the acquisition of party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourasa, who made the James Book, our party always knew to determine the future', Jean Charest explained.
In contrast to the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, to the programme `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the project Waterkraftstaudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stresses that its launch was planned for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there' he trusted his party members in what was proclaimed in those storms of applaudation.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility to hold a choice that is possible from the law.
He stressed that his calendar is full, however, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitutional objectives' which were adopted without delay: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the Guidelines of the Nord Plan were introduced with skepticism.
The Chief of the Party of Québécois, Pauline Marois, has repeated the development policy of the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Government of Landry in 2001.
According to her, when it came to power in 2003, the liberal government refused to apply it.
If she had done so, "while we were going to do much further today", Mrs Marois sentenced on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a plan in the north by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just a big idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - A disgusting country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in the Cabinet Harper was the one who allowed her last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister around as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only one of all the countries concerned, has not brought home their landman captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened that were thrown against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier live under inhuman conditions.
The only one who turns down to a judicial parodie to assess the debt of the accused.
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers plead to get Omar Khadr home in order to get a fair process in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before torture: It is little interested that a young adult will certainly be broken forever after so many years of pain.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are now experiencing a stupid circumcision of our rights, of our freedom and of our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying here as a flag, and that sounds so nonsense from his mouth.
So there has been a time when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be mistreated, tortured and imprisoned, even after a government head's good thoughts, which is only supported by the minority until now (may he be part of the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they don't see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Tuws, is in this reproach, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows a orwellic logic, that the world's largest gold gaining company aimed at opening a "public transparent debate" a blasphemy of over six million against three authors and a small mediumless publisher house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they will judge not about the truth, especially in the case of accusations, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr Garver.
For for Barrick Gold, the best way is to lead a public debate to destroy everyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Regardless of the process, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against a army of lawyers paid from the nearly unusual bags of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal fights are often to ruin the defenders to force a consensus regulation that makes the opposite mouth dead and also disturbs anyone who dares to reconsiderate the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out by exchange of ideas and not by knüppelhiebe.
So it would have been enough if the gold mines had revealed their books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can simultaneously ask for a 'public' debate and not ignore the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President only includes the lawyers paid generously, and not the community of all Canadians; a very well-beened view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't want to understand - or not understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many observe as a knee complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold just made a claim to the authors of Noir Canada in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the foundation of truth, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to research and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The unproportionate complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what it predicts, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the Governing Congress Assembly, Republicans and Democrats finally agreed yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking the Wall Street for months, must still be adopted by the two convention chambers.
The main contents are: better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public funds used, new provisions to reduce the number of houses bound by payment residues, and the right to monitor wages paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of MEPs, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who attended the negotiations, declared yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market', explained the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
`It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at the Wall Street', explained the democracy.
`This is the basic point: if we do not do so, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances in the Americans' daily life will be huge', said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that would have had a new failure to the mood of investors.
The date agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather than advocates of agreement, but without fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama occupied the addition of certain decisions to agree, in particular those which would allow owners to keep their homes and those relating to the salaries of the Governing Employees of the company saved by the State.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to congratulate you on.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another transmitter to vote for the proposed plan, his republic opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guidelines I have read show that this is a matter that we will all have to devour, and with which we will be able to proceed.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by placing a real estate bubble, which first led to the breakdown of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before it expanded to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of republic Members had failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the democratics have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies in distress are only to be secured by the government and not to be purchased, it is believed that they are escaped from the Sackgasse.
In order to round the perspective for all at the Congress, a decision has also been added that, if the government should lose losses with this programme within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to recover its own capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payments must be adopted by the Congress in a new vote.
On the contrary to his assistance, Washington receives shares of the supported companies that bring him in in the case of profits dividends, and which can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the detention procedures relating to housing bound to the real estate credits affected by this plan, and also to set the deadlines for refunds and recoveries paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Members to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
`Goodly Washington does not understand us', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Committee on Finance, his voters.
`Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in order to ask the taxpayers for the cash.
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress called the Caucus of skeptics, represents things differently, but concludes the same conclusion.
` Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three nobel prizeers, have written to inform us: We ask the convention not to be under pressure, and carefully consider the way it is going,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we received again evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
In an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial governmentalisation of the Fortis Banking Group for EUR 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced that it would not buy up its competitor, which is in great difficulties since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis through risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85.000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a loss of money, explained yesterday to the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate for this, we receive a right of election and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the sparers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.
During that time, on the other side of the Ermkanal, the British Government was just trying to embark on another bank in distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which had to be the government of the UK since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of engaged icons
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself with the charming smile from the narcissist mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a big permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, aged 83 as a result of the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was like and for which he for a long time was a kind of rival on the canvas, more carefully in his play, probably also crushing, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, on television and soon in the movie.
Like this man who struggled for civil rights, the driver, who became the 24-hour race of Mans Second in 1979, was also a sex symbol, although he lived in a pre-view relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, engaged and over-sensitive star, whose puzzles will never be completely solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans placed the cinema lovers this weekend in dumel, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than a half-century American film art moves over with him in constant change.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) remembrances again, and the young man, who has shown his senseful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) back to The Cat on the hot Blechdach, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter relapse is awakened (90), which is called upon his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not all fulfill their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were there in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, whose death was restarted and made the Newman very well announced in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded in 1973 with the Oskar for the best film.
As a bitter and rageful billion player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
Still he.
In his life course, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an ice-sockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as a pat of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema layers who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time and betray Hollywood, his wealth, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his explicit performance.
The metre wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose rolls just fled so long.
He, however, played rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotics, alcoholics, birds, or desperate, with their perfect presentation he reflected his deflection and his revolt.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, draws a gentle woman portrait full of melancholic oil.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated to this 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work of fineness and sadness.
At the flood of honors that were over Newman ergoss yesterday, his close friend and former weaponsmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained extremely: `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Growth and joy were essential qualities of the dead actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great defendant of civil rights, environmental protection and the independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's deployment, is now going there.
We have often seen him stand with the foot in shells full of vinegarrettes, in sauces, bakks or other foods, and this thought rather tasteless, even though we at first found it fun.
Yet, the profits of his sales flow into his foundation for children in distress.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.
And for us, it was an honor to have the life of such a intelligent and generous American actress.
An exemplary citizen, in the nearest and widest sense.
What was produced in the bill factory of additive &amp; Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations on Jano's surgery and his competitors began in the criminal proceedings.
In particular, the accused is confronted with the involvement in organised crime, gross injury and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document counterfeiting.
According to the public prosecution, the appropriations made by tenders were used for their own purposes, while the benefits made were often invoked with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are to be partly fed into the fees of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly into the private cash of individuals.
As announced by the investigation authorities, in respect of the tendering funds, feasive accounts were submitted and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the accounts are supposed to have been faked.
The accounting blocks were bought at the market by Jozsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Plate Sea to which István Lados was sent by János' grant.
In the course of this "recognition tour" Lados should find out pensions and restaurants.
He demanded invoices on consumers to be able to issue accounts based on these proposals for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices are supposed to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his compliant, and the latter is supposed to have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "Experience tour" was a beer room.
As two accounts issued by grant and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have maintained the ninety-head group of the Association of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the manager of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 on the Foundation of Job Jöv州ért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten persons at the same time, 130 guests are supposed to have stayed, according to bill.
The fantasy of the counterfeiters seemed to have been set no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting the customers' documents Job Jöv州ért and Hoppá, according to the charge authority, do not appear at all.
According to the editor of the Hvg.hu, Mr Farkas, he was immediately aware that it was fake documents when the prosecutor was presented to him during a consultation.
"Our company name and tax number were wrongly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact was also wrong that the operation must have stayed a hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to offer so many people space.
It has also been mentioned on the invoice that the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The official counterfeiters also intend to verify that the Budapest travel agency that they have taken in view offers exclusive travel abroad, and thus they have indicated Hungary tickets on the bar payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also indicated VAT on the accounts, although travel agencies referring to a non-EU country are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was a total of four from Hotel Révfülauf Kft. Unfailed invoices issued to the Foundation of Job Jöv州ért, since the operation instead of 25 only amounts to 15 percent VAT, and the employees are exhibited exclusively machine invoices, however, the fake documents were manually.
Another mistake undergoing the "calculators" was that in a case of "carriage" they had indicated that they were earned, although this was not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the public prosecutors informed.
Further form errors - wrong account format, false stamp - were due to the facts issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány as well as to XXI. Századi Cultureális Egyesület and Biztos Pont.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers delighted to have never issued the bills.
Another "fault" is the counterfeit of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was in dissolve at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - so the Mass Manager stated that the bills were not issued itself.
Knowledge Fake
The other group of accounting providers are persons who have been fully aware that they have to lay fictive accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation of Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued bills for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at a height of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the appellant, the manager of the Collab Kft. was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fictive invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also in Liquidation, is also intended to have cooperated with additives and co.: In 2003, the GmbH was supposed to have provided the Foundation of Job Jöv
However, there was also little payment traffic, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the persons concerned have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall include persons directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the poster of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not inventible fuel and vehicle trade company.
This company is supposed to have issued several accounts on the sale of EV components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million in the period of October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been the buyer of these invoices since 14 September 2005 in Liquidation.
The company's manager was a Romania, which was also to be submitted by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been present during the investigations, invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the Association of Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have disposed of their equivalent itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies was active, according to the accused of lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: On request of his competitor, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued, on behalf of the companies, invoices to the associations associated with contracts, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 accounts in total of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The public prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have taken 10% of the sum of accounts each and VAT.
Kubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövtség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the socialist party's common organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints, but these amounts have been used for foreign purposes.
In order to hide this, they presented five fictive invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were also ensured in the examination of the Office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused people are now counting with a confession on the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been put before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if the principal prosecutor Jano's submission decided to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and even though he had already promised to report extensively about everything, his confession remains.
The question remains therefore open whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a package with him on the recovery of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether it is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that surgery now plays the "insulted" after his search for mildening the imprisonment and house arrest had hit on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much more damage with economic crimes and have not paid them are on a free foot, or at least under house arrest, are rejected.
The psychology of the supply - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and therefore overestimate the error offered.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an increase on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lottery while the others participated in a gambling action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to gain money, but an increased activity of the Stratum, a complex below the brain barbecue, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, where the survival of the opponent plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore argued that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatum.
In order to support their these, the economists in the research group have conducted additional investigations to follow up the money.
In this case, three groups should be involved against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the real value of the product and then they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore merely that the emphasis was on one of the winnings, while the other was on the loss.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "contrary to losing" group were ready to make more efforts than those in the control or the "winning" group.
"These results can be derived from no previous economic theory.
They have just justified the behavior observed in auctions with the joy of gaining or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaginary neurological process, so that we have now a third explanation prepared" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economics.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor be visited?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated to be a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are common, but the irritations and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the bacteria, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body liquids (e.g. sperm, scissor or spray).
Travelers are recommended for vaccination against viruses A and B, at least there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are shown about two or three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and fracture.
After that, the yellowness appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the cure may last for up to two or three weeks.
Around the world, about 1 million people die every year of the diseases caused by hepatitis B such as liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected in drug treatment is.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, as the infector devours the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular control tests, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequent: those who have been taking a blood transfusion before 1991, drug-dependents, and tattoos.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely detected, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thus baning the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
On September 30, the world day of hepatitis, 2004, is the first time organised by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious faith is like a kind of "power" that is supposed to have enlightened the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been examined in how far faith in God affects the painful feeling of man, reports the British magazine "telegraph".
During the more bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electrical shocks while studying a painting of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers could disable most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it was even demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologians from various university departments also participate alongside scientists.
When attempted, a shining device was connected to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: one of the pictures of God's mother, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would produce a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they chose the image of da Vinci because it was hardly different from the other paintings and felt calm.
The subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and received 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while either they should view the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that when they looked at the mother of God, they felt "in security" as if they were "concerned" and they felt "calm and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that similar effects could also be generated with other, strong-acting images, even with the atheists, that you should just find the appropriate photo.
"We have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna picture Leonardos or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you tell about yourself
At its tenth birthday, Google can claim with fur and right: it is to be found in the pockets of people as above their heads in the heavens: she knows where people spent their vacation, which specialists they are going to and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managers.
In the direction of skeptics that are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets them be just ignored by the essential part of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently thought that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus draw closer to the company's original goal of ordering "all information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changed work, Google was still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs were not able to do so, as they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that in the course of their Internet surveys the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the sites visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and later react to it, so that the meetings can be generated much more precisely later, and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the user wonders what happens in the case of data abuse - "If you look at what I am doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which makes fear encouraging, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to fight the power that many Internet users have to reject.
However, it is proven that the search terms are not only stored but, in the event of a chance, also distributed to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google delivered information to the Brazilian government collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also allowed the identification of pedophiles.
For personal rights, however, users could still breathe in May when Google successfully moved against the FBI with the Citizen Rights Organization EFF, which means that Google can not be forced to publish information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
(The Federal Government has successfully achieved the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms in reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search term list, has been retroactively maintained for two months.)
Therefore, Google's Image remains controversial: Those who do not want to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using the Google services, the company is challenging with the due wrath of the conservative companies.
However, the American "Geek Cultural" is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, see the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason is that Google does not demand any identification codes to its users, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services freely, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program packaging seem to be far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks look at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing but collaboration, speaking, the users deliberately leave traces and benefit the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
A average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with each other by means of other services such as Twitter, or musical services such as last.fm, and can eventually include all this in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo gallerys that are posted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When looking at the party photos last night, the friend will soon find out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the staff will be released because in his blog he is only too honestly making his trouble about business management - one is sure: the term "privateness" has now been completely re-interpreted.
A person who lives online is what he prizes - in such a way as to form the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google Monopol, can do this – like with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google's search engine, will not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not a few people deliberately register not on Community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not create the best possible profile by the user.
However, the public opinion waits boundly until Google shows her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the more and more rapidly introduced services not only provide Microsoft but also other software developers headbreak.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the group management has completely rejected a protest from the employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and also the management said that the multi-time consumption of the employees is too expensive. However, all of this is quite mildly advocated that in 2006, before the Chinese government even went into the knee and agreed with an agreement, that all regimecritical meetings, or those who dispute against the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service will be purchased in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could reverse somewhat strongly: while some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archive project will now assume that the company should soon deal with the Supreme Court of Justice, others are rather worried about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellic manner a future in which a man gets terriblely close to Google-related data.
Two youths help the double killer of Ozd to remove tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ozd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to remove the traces, the speaker of the police Commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were stable and are currently accused of aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened by a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local resident, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspected to have murdered several people deliberately out of greed.
In the course of the investigations, it has been shown that the 23-year-old had declared a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to repay his debts, so he attracted his believer to an area in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the tactical weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Stock Exchange offers purchases for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaws offered stock exchanges for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that the Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchanges.
That's why Warsaw's stock exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, who, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the next few months.
According to reports from the Czech newspaper "E15" the offering of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have offered offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that of all the stakeholders the Warschauer Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke of the second 11 September on Tuesday.
The global financial disaster we have to thank the American President, said about "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to make his own party for the draft law behind him to bring some relieving to the terrifying situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billions of investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a "second September 11th".
Parts of the Madrid press also found the sinbook in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the convention, the risk that Washington has no political means of crisis management is threatened.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of capitalism's history takes place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, for example, is meant by the Geneva "day indicators".
Although some countries could still provide their money institutions, which were in the wake, with rescue packages, and save the banks with the taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are more banks going on, then no further financial sprays or other emergency measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna's "The Standard". Furthermore, the newspaper continues, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, the European taxpayers must now take a bit deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not seriously faced the crisis, which is now as a tsunami over the old continents.
However, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to address taxpayers' money immediately with several hundred billion euros.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate natural obstacle sensors?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented a amazing project in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired to create new accident preventive systems.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the biomimetic system controlled by authoroboters by type BR23C, a mini car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collision.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composed eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To imitate the function of the composed eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a 180 degree vision field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by rotating the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manöver takes place instinctively.
"If not, the authorobot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the autoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately as this technology corresponds to the innerst and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer that is currently considered unavoidable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the bees' behavior when they differ from other bees.
And this has to last in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, it can not occur up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, just towards the turnability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open to other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotation, acceleration and braking at the autoroboter.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to store this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manöver, so that it uses only a handful of KB Memory.
No Gigabyte and Megabyte Heavy Memories are required.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serially in production within the next ten years, according to the assessment of Nissan.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the car driver around obstacles and thus leading it to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the 700-Mrd dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims at buying the bad credits of the banks.
In the first round, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight Eastern coastal time, the congress delegates, after several days' debates, have reached an agreement on the 700 million dollars heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Members, and said that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, said to the result: The programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to be done even more.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, i.e., the time of Washington Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Mediterranean European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a height flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, first the House of Members agrees on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is in line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the initial recommendation of the Bush Administration that the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase, with credits of securities charged.
A first tranche is intended to spend up to half of the 700 million dollars, where 250 billion are available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit-loaded, poor securities, and the President is to decide over the other 100 billion USD.
The programme is reviewed by a own Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the convention.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can also purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can take place both at an auction and directly.
The law enables the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the anxieties and pays the fees to comply with the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid for the US financial system, whether it is available for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson.
However, the managers of the banks in trouble and now instructed for state aid can expect that their executions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake, will be reduced by the government.
A reduction in salaries will only be in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will help each.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry buys in the context of an auction, the Golden Handshake will be taxed unless the exempted bank manager will be postponed to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the faulty loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that manager wages are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake Treaties are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that reductions in manager wages are regulated by law, commented by the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers falls, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescue bank gets better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years as to how taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
There were, however, skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not at all protect the money of taxpayers, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were advanced by the same people, which are also responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices increased further
According to the Central Statistical Office, sales prices in the country rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to August 2007, by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were by 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year prices.
As a result of price changes in the domestic and export sector, production prices were by 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and by 3.2% higher than in 2007.
The domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a few - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - here was the increase of 4.6 percent, in shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials were significantly driven in chemicals and production (1.6 per cent).
A price reduction was observed in the raw oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), and in the wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the paper production, as well as in the publishing and printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, an increase in prices was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the main domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, primarily due to the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry are considered in the annual comparison, prices in raw oil processing have risen most (32.4 per cent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2% was observed, while the increase in food, beverages and tobacco was 11%.
A price reduction was observed in the textile industry (2.5 per cent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 per cent).
The volume of depreciation in the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 per cent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the investment goods sector (0.7 per cent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sector compared to the previous month.
The largest price rise in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reinsurance sector (16.8 per cent) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods sectors, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was noted in the investment goods a price reduction of 1.4 per cent.
The industrial export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but the annual comparison decreased by 3.9 per cent.
The domestic currency became by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent weaker, and compared to the rate of August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent, even by 15.9 per cent at the dollar compared to the euro.
No more visa in the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th Jens, as the Foreign Minister declared before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their view is that "all is now only dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in the overseas time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian Diplomacy is conducting negotiations today in Washington.
It meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give them the "Mediterranean Winning Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts discussions with the external political consultants of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support saving packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, agreed on Sunday to support the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and Representative of the Government announced, after day-long Marathon consultations, on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the grinding of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his predecessor thanks to economic topics, while McCain's High, which gave him the presentation of the Vice-Presidency candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted up at the same time.
On Sunday at a election event in Detroit, Obama expressed his hope that the convention will quickly accept the law on the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that it has supported.
"We have to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, whole industrial branches, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" he said before 35,000 audiences.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet".
In an interview given to the Sender ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have hard to cook (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the executions for top managers - something that he had insisted on.
The CBS said to Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in negotiations, but he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the House of Members is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking room
The right camp is intact, only the choosers became more self-conscious within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers."
According to the renowned polytologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something ended, which was already quite precisely depicted ten years ago: the doubtful hegemony of a state party
For, ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 per cent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty-per cent market.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Federal Day elections, so still in the much cited stoiber era.
The modernisation consistently operated by the CSU in the state has ultimately destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this for 40 years ago but estimated significantly in the pace, but without any effects, secularisation, education, the flow of eastern and northern Germans into the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain faithful to the CSU elections.
Modernization is always going along with optional increase, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the choosers in the camp became more critical and willing.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks the classic citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and electors with an abiture such as university graduation.
Here the CSU's support decreased to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with who? Party managers who hold back in coalition issues", titled articles about the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OVP.
The OVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to conversations in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders were hardly looking into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some states and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current CEO as a vice-cancer, let Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have picked the Schüssel-Molter-Course.
It would not be possible to repeat this direction.
However, Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fertile, he said when Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently fully open, and these questions should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Jároka: The devil circle of poverty and Segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has started, which is directed by the French Presidency of the EU.
In their speech addressed to the Plenum, Livia Járóka, the Fidesz Department of the European People's Party, notably to the educationalegregation, since it is one of the most serious infringements that occurs to Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civilian organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
The press office of the Fidesz European Parliament reports that Jaroka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the job search, Roma would primarily be pushed out of the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The majority of Roma youths have no middle education, and due to poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach university graduation."
In addition, Jaróka stressed that education is a fundamental human rights, which would be a key role in implementing other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
The Members believe that it is important that this context becomes aware of a widest possible circle - i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts the school, so that his chances of being a productive member of the labour market are increasing; and by means of income and sales tax they contribute to national expenditure.
"As Union citizens, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education needs to be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members stated, a joint, targeted and process-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation process in the educational sector and to ensure proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the devil circle of poverty, Segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full-righted citizens," called Jaroka.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace in time
At the end of October the destiny of the falling Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the electoral debt, no heads are sometimes rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were declared.
Head of Party Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The destiny of the tendem after the disastrous 17% voting loss will be decided on the extraordinary party day on the last October week.
But the much trained Duo already made it clear that it does not want to stick to her seats.
In this way, they want to relieve the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 per cent. However, now, a year after the putch against the Stuiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 per cent of the voices.
For 46 years, the CSU was a "single governmenter" in Bayern, which acquired 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state of the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will have to rule in a coalition.
As the first sign of partial internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seehofer is also included in the exploratory team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or with the legally-oriented "Free Electors" talk about a possible monnik coalition.
An irony of fate is that the list of "Free Electors" that Gabriele Pauli enters the Legislacy, whose anti-Stoiers appeared first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to disappear the targeted politician without grace.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its powers on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoibers, who have so far pulled the threads out of the background, will become an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called on 28 September the "best day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - he believes the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not being put back on the leg with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot be again a Chancellor after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hole because of its disappointment over the Fiasko, believes that the loss of terrain of the CSU will not affect the great coalition in Berlin.
But what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of social democracies continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no Member of the Opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has succeeded.
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects infringements in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitants state has come out for decades without opposition. However, the counterparty gathered under the name "United Democratic Powers" (ODS) before the elections yesterday, has seriously hoped that Lukechenko, who, thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, had renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, would "late" some opposition members in Parliament.
That is why the ODS even took away from the previously planned boykottes.
Thanks to the rising prices of gas imports from Russia, Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the economy. For the reduction of price increases, even loans have been received, and the country has also received the sales of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians, so in the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukechenko and other high-level politicians have been banned for the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD's evaluation report, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - which would mean that oppositions were not present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, opposition can recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South-Ossetia and Abchazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, which has been regarded as independent for two areas for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty have been afraid to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not intend to protest against the results, but rather trys to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities lay our way in the distribution of stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly" - Milinkewitsch said that not even the most supported layer of pensionists agree with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only deserve is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" beginning to break to the silence of a cemetery," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the actions, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now it is breakfast before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotable doors for the entrance and exits of the officials.
From today the measure will take effect against those mud eggs, which will only stamp off and then go coffee drinks during the working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Dirable doors are a means to increase working efficiency through a higher rate of presence and more services", said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment will end in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotable doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
So there is no breakfast in everything during working time now; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works miracles."
At a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica)
from Rome, the minister announces that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 people are more at work per year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration.
"Their wage dynamics - such as the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the past 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have come together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles with figures about lower absences in work - the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulze' are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have come together to explain war to the unlawful standards of the Decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is combated for additional financial compensation for work-related disease, and the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations, will be contested.
Napolitano: "Prophylaxing against accidents is decisive"
Every day there are 2500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalid for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal work accidents were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is almost twice the death caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will be the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in order to direct the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisive question of prevention at work.", confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandeli.
The Head of State expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting wounded workers, supporting the families of victims and awareness of public opinion".
"A disgusting "Bast" has risen on this; understandably in tragedys, which, measured by their size, trigger some spines in the media and the public's participation. However, daily reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case a resource problem: it needs to be decisively invested in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for more direct awareness in the school framework are particularly important since young people who are feeding the working world.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "the phenomenon of work-related deaths as an urgent social emergency, which infringes the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at bringing an end to the problem".
"The data of work accidents seem to signal a slightly improvement, but this does not preclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses the President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandeli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you do not really take too much to cope with the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it by various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting at school".
"A further effort is necessary - so he adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from the employers' sides is demanded for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandeli also referred to "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the accident victims of work" and dealt with the "abolition of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the workers a guarantee back to insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident of work will not be dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a lawyer."
Mp3 player in charge: Danger of hearing damage
Sounding music over a longer period with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing harm.
This is what the European Commission, quoted in a report published today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – said in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who for at least five years longer than an hour a day hear sound with portable music devices risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of youths, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, will damage their hearing without knowing it indefinitely," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said by the European Union – show a clear risk that pushes to rapid action.
What really matters is to make consumers aware and make these information common.
In view of these scientific knowledge, we need to review the existing control systems again in order to be fully effective and to keep steps with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical devices among young people.
"The scientists - which concludes the EU communication - confirm that you are quite concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents better from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment which limits the level of noise of portable music devices to 100 dB.
These damages can be very restricted, in which solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise display are taken.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week loud (only as 89 Decibel) music, so that the legal limits already have been exceeded, the maximum noise level at work are applicable.
Those who cross this border risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This amounts to 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start shot to "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June, the balance is drawn.
This is the term set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla Therms.
In six months, the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Chief Citizen Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it" - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains for the city and municipality.
There is no re-distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - so announced by the mayor - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, as they lack their view of liability, answer Alemanno: "All depends on the work which the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deal with daily problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period in mind to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The chief mayor of Rome stresses the importance of clarifying the following: "This Commission is not a useless institution or wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think about it. It will take care of the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city to jump a quality - which it really needs - and thus take a common step in the future".
A future, as the chief mayor of Rome, which "will limit itself not only in the current local borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropole and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician, who is much involved in being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and this still does as a private man)".
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly violent, right now where the elections are approaching.
A woman from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frightened: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks, and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a great advance.
In this case, too, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the electoral cabin we will know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crawl, whether for Obama or McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something that was never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so secure.
In all cases, despite all these thoughts, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step into the ass.
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who is going to take his job is faced with a huge task.
US. The financial collapse leaves its traces also with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the reductions. And many accuse the Internet, the "Morder" of the print press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not declare any real concern to the information relating to the advisors because of the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists a economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the newsroom reductions, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, as the journalists interviewed, if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today fulfils the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believes that journalistism is in the wrong way at national level.
In the local field, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the way the web is going.
The main publishers are going to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the print press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists experience has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology, in the hope "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rise is in American journalism today between the heads of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of Heads at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while it is only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
Operators who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", "Red.") is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as the United States are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer their popularity and so it becomes a question of taking it or leave it.
Chef actors often receive very high wages, but the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance funds.
As regards holidays, the matter is complicated: a certain quantity of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often be "sick" over the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROOT-FERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate maker, which had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of bankruptcy in the context of the counter-contract investigation in the event of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be moved from the province city to a apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (which the prosecutor had spoken against) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain proof to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Members voted against the $700 billion spare package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports on the crisis in the course of the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, who always favored the government institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are opposed to "the ones in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, in the south and the centre of the States of voters.
This part of the party is thanks to its rise in favour of the voice I mentioned above.
However, this example that is just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even already represents: not only in the United States, also in the West, and perhaps beyond them, will be affected by it.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that finally accept and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close connections with abroad and at the same time manage a tremendous amount of private household assets living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments, namely how it is to deal with the affected families, which is a huge elective mass.
The crisis thus appears economically global, and politics on the other hand it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been lost in itself and lost its right to speak: the intimate evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its two-division, cannot find a common path in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone now expects to intervene in its own state; rescue plans, new rules, and including distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became more serious, only the United States is in economic situation without foreign aid.
And in addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: so two conditions – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organisation or market will be able to react in a similar way.
The new emphasis on the state-national element is in perfect conformity with the increasing importance that has recently been associated with a closest related sector in the economy: the territories.
Paradoxicly, it is now that we were so convinced that we were long into a networked total empire, into a realm of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial, that we need to see at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can certainly all be transported from one place to the other world, they are still connected to the extreme with a tightly written piece of earth – a territorie.
Therefore, the one with such a territory is in favour of another who lives in an unharvested, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second news, which requires a short deposit.
Whoever's territory, whoever's government, who's saying politics, also says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge of the need for seen leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing leaderships, including those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, a deep enough and in some sense still disturbing aspect comes: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of inappropriateness, a feeling of distance that is all addressed to a whole class of managers of the western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is the way, that it is not only the actions of the social elites, but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salaries are more and more foreign than ever.
Thus, the demand for Leadership is undergroundly a depletioned but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate revolt of the collective mind state of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the breakdown of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy here plays a role).
One wins the impression that the old elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and, therefore, less representative value of what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still strengthened and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open, but it is certainly not.
The super sticker that lets up on walls
The forces of gravity thanks to a sticker and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, from which one now seems to have reached almost the target.
With a sticker put on a surface of only 2.5 mcm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – which has an American journal – has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanor tubes.
"The principle of the sticker can be imagined like a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic harps, which give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sleeve paper have shown that the new sticker is ten times stronger than the sustainability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "leave problemlessly from the wall," said Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Engineering Sciences.
"This material could be used as a morbid adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman going up to walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall within the area of space.
So for the moment the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART of research – including the University of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new type of clothing.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfibre sticker that, by movement on a surface itself, cleanses themselves from the dust and thus keeps a perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Caution for grape fruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in the summer because of their refreshing quality and vitamin riches, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme impact on the intake by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices in connection with medicines. As part of the 236th meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again alarmed: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the capability of certain vital medicines so far that they are practically eliminated and thus threatened to the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, heart circulation drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS IN Risk – The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix two years ago, and stressed what is being drinked in connection with such drugs as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that may inhibit medicinal products.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, Director of the Universityà Statale di Milano, appealed: "These results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, which try to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, not ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert of the Ansa Agency emphasizes.
Economic Nobel Price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel prize is to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policies of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron crash, Krugman claimed that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the murders.
A prophecy that received a few polemics as an answer and was held to the economer many years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the breakdowns of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public perspective," explained Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package
The date of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both in the voluntary and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting to the audience with some news: in addition to a revised and now Spartanic-designed start menu, one of the reasons for ensuring compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Further, eight against the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which for example facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and keeping the original appearance of the page.
It is now possible to create "hybride" PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now be processed multi-handed by different users, thus avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a frabe to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the next few weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
Additional to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, if freeness can be an incentive for the distribution of the programme into private households, it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the great throw: eventually various public administration and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is no lack of even a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation program; Calc, the table program that aims to suppress Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase to drive databases instead of the more famous access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded for 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Coal also positively tested and thus the fourth doping fall
It opens up a new Doping Case mi Frame of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner team, who is the third classified and winner of the Tricot of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. This was already met with the Italians Riccardo Ricccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood samples of Cohl is among those that have been performed in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian advisors.
The 26-year-old Austrian stood behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMAGINATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKED: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the zealous country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with contradictions.
Does this be a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This is the question of the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the topic of racism in Italy and is the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, which was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a package of cookies.
The case reflects what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those "most integrated and working opportunities" and still "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and for the faster disposal of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlines the Pope and the State President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism."
Students are victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rent prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last survey by Sunia, the Rental Association, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. A lot of students have lost their right to study, since their families are not able to support them at this height" – says the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand of students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no leasing price limit, unauthorized suburbs.
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rent prices by reviewing taxation.
When considering the investigation more accurately, it appears that in Milan there is a sleeping area in the district of Brianza about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter bands of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or at least 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping area of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices are located in the quarters around the uni at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
The rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome are only slightly deeper: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecità.
Only those who escape from outside districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of hiring to foreign European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is about 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradise – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multipleexkinos.
"A city without cinemas are a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complex in the periphery, in the long term means death for the single-sale cino in the centre. A process that appears not only indispensable and irreversible but also carry the trains of cultural crime.
Most of them are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with which you've left a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburb kinos and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well lost kino world forever.
The numbers that the Anec, the central trade association, deliver a clear language: in the last five years, the unhearted amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these cinemas mostly paid the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardy with 41.
This indicates that the main debtors are the multipleexkinos, because it is just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardies are the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "though it is useful that new structures are also arising, but first of all is the reception of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all its ancestor customers are willing to visit a multi-excino in the periphery instead of the old.
And here, the lack of funding for the Commerce Fund remains out of mind: the debt burden recorded by the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame of the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, there would be between 16 and 18 million euros per year of needs."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec because of the fears of the old cinemas; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, and this is both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The predicted measures also include tax advantages for the cinema operators and benefits for the public in relation to transport: it will be allowed to drive into the transport restricted areas of the centre and also to park more favourable parking fees.
"It is a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to deal with the superpower of the Multiex Halls, because eventually the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important to me: the closing of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' leads to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group of Piromalli.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia belonging to Calabrien against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for development in Mafia businesses, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the Clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer who has the same name as the boss of the Clan, had already been condemned for the development in criminal associations of the Mafia at that time to a sum of 10 million euros of compensation.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard is disregarded," says the lawyers, "the two local administrations have decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consultative activities."
"As a result, the Mafia Group – the judges – had been able to intervene officially in the Council houses and to co-determine the policy of public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Committee of Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of 'Ndrangheta': heroes who get a white west."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were kidnapped.
Since the end of April the municipality had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but already in 1991 – and also at the time due to claimed links between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians had been disappeared.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Utc, was elected as head of the Middle Law Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipality.
He was interested in the vice-president Marco Minniti, who accused to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with this morning's arrest order that the Piromalli-Clan had even waived to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the investigations in the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, which is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has proved to be the same as the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-decorating source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand the world's large energy companies.
Waves, flows and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking for all, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not randomly intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke in by 1980, the idea of sea energy is contaminated, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be satisfied by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the doubled energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and times would come.
Giants on the attack.
The first company that now puts on sea energy is Enersis, who signed a 2005 contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that put on maritime energy gain.
"Chevron examines these technologies," says the speaker of a company known to the American Giant in the Wall Street Journal, and considers the possibility of cooperating with us."
This is about the acquisition of an authorisation from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project outside the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, e.g. when one considers that in Alaska, oil is continued to be promoted by the United States and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drills.
Besides Chevron, the companies are also Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who invest in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Still improving technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in breakdown, this is not the last, since the last doubts of environmental protectionists have not yet been clarified.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather small and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technology is needed with much greater influence on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power approximately uses a system of connected boys.
The shoe of the waves, which moves the boys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming pools over collars and cylinders.
This is driving a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity will be sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval, and part of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times drive the turbines, which are eating the generator through the resulting rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of possible clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Electricity Acquisition Research, immediately deserves the potential that is in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, times are better predictable than wind flows, sunlight and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable electricity source.
It is precisely the tide energy that led States such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest 7,5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
