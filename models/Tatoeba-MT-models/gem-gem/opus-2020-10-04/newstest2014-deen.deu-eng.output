Goodach: More security for footgängers
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 football Temple was taken into operation at the village park - in the sight of the older Rathausampel.
Two plants so close together: intentions or shieldbourgeois?
This question was answered clearly by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was then installed because it secured the schoolway," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser Amplifier secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The installation which was officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, the Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the transport flow from the residential area ›Grub.
"In the high transport and pedestrian rise, there was a further need for their safety," said Eckert.
Peter Arnold is also confirmed by the Office of State Councils of Apenburg.
"On the day, according to current measurements, at B 33, about 12 000 vehicles pass the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent are heavy load traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another ampel is more than necessary: "Security is going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were conducted, and a circuit was also planned, but rejected for the narrowness of the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, when choosing the Ampelmasters, everything was tested before: "Amounts of an extra for us with very long wooden loaded transporters we have tested whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without climbing the Ampelmasters."
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive amplification system itself is the "modernst thing there is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with coloured LEDs that are so powerful that, for example, the lights of the car drivers are well recognized in the deep sun.
And she is also sparing: the older light plants are consuming about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three light plants per direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new installation: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the ampel button, the upper radar sensor tests the transport situation.
If the road is free, comes immediately green for the walker, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone comes safely across the railway," explained Arnold.
Of course, the car driver must think here as a partner and watch the railway.
This wasn't the case yesterday: the ampel for pedestrians showed green, released a high-class vehicle through - in lighting red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth of the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hang of roaring violence and stranger sexuality, the tightness and cheerfulness - have often described the corn poet.
Known is the bookner price carrier mainly as a prosa author, theatre texts are in his work rar.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents a collage of prosa texts in the garage X at Petersplatz for his performance "weather lights on the tongue tip", which is now being seen in the Garage X, thus compiling a collage of prosatexts.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographicly characterised novel "The Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Look, his family beauty" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important receipt: a circuited sofa, on which the text material is reproduced and masturbated - the eight-head ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance transmits the template with abundance of government incidences, known from the stock post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses are involved in the somewhat questionable scenario implementations.
They are touched hard, with their heads tucked under water, with their evening ropes onto the wall.
Intruded in cellophane or myter, they staked on dangerously high stocks through the inscension, either monologizing them loudly or lay completely astonished on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this hard way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from the Deep Purple to the popular songgut.
Only at the end, the overwhelmed performance comes something to rest, and Winklers sealed absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planers are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that takes place in each car's armature board.
The devices recording every travelled kilometer and reporting the information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Office to revise the obsolete system for the financing of US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly unfolded an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaires have linked themselves to environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the travelled kilometers – and perhaps where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate taxes.
The Tea Party is disturbed.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while one cannot agree on an action at the convention, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently investigating how they can change to a system in which drivers pay per travelled mile during the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the travel writers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing that we’ll only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the traveled miles with all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes that Americans pay on the tape pillar, is pleasant.
But in America, no more is taken as much as before.
Cars use less petrol.
The government oil tax of 18.4 cent per gallone (less than 4 cent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare at high spray prices, also raise taxes by just one cent.
“The benzine tax is simply inappropriate”, says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Officecrates call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is in favour of urban liberals, for example, because taxes could be used to influence driving behaviour in a way that reduces steadyness and climately harmful exhaust gases.
The Californian plans set up the system for the preparation of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state of climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most walkable long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also concerned with the idea of allowing drivers to pay on a retired route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reason Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had invited the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting in a 2011 report.
Last year, the US Senat approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the incidence and thus reacted to the concerns of Members from rural areas representing people who often have to leave many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several state states and large cities move in this direction, despite their own faust.
The most engaged is Oregon, who currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mile charges instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers this.
Illinois tests it in limited measure with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Remember on Big Brother and such things were a major problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Performance Management at the Ministry of Transport in Nevada.
People didn't want to.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their website: “It would be relatively easy to transform the travel writers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, blocked technological infrastructure that would be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of state states who are now looking for affordable technology, with which the State can capture the travelled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
So, like Khan, the public would also be more calm.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially join in helping states in taxing car drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in a rising market for Kfz insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the travelled miles.
However, the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planers, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” explained Ryan Morrison, director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a standard fee on the basis of the average miles travelled by all inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrusted public by providing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, insurance must only be paid for travelled kilometers, and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real-time, thanks to the car drivers from Staus.
“Automobile drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate,” says a city planning document.
However, some transport plans wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that the Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional single fee or an annual levy could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles consuming little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little crew beat awake
The volunteer fire force managed their fall head sample despite personal deficiency with bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There is supposed to have been a short closure during the sewing.
Two people were injured by the arising fire and the development of smoke, but one of them could still send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two breathprotectors of the war were ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it succeeded in finding the first person and leading into the free.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as a tight staircase was also to overcome.
The building, an integrated workshop for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machines for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out over a flood hydrogen in about 100 meters distance.
Now three erasing attacks could be created.
A hole radiation pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also showing in the exercise what is to be accomplished with little staff available.
In serious cases, support is made via the Kongsfeld day-to-day group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzzwald, Landtagspresident Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the support centre Heavyzwart, he and the managers of the professional schools, and the circuit gymnasium and the parents' council chairpersons examined this important question.
"Training is an important location factor", underlined Claudia Steele, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center High-Blackzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the circuit gymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised the family friendliness in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but because of the demographic change, it is also the phase to care for family care," said Wolf.
He also argued that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a cessation of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For who has already learned the benefits of the region during his study remains often acquiring the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to strengthening the region," the country day president was convinced.
For only if adequate training places were offered, the need for professionals could also be satisfied.
He believes that the region's advantage is its advantage in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his railway from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Keep persistent and make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
With music a entertaining afternoon experienced
For 15 years the Kaul family has already invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were protected in the racist place.
This afternoon will take place in St. Joseph's nursing home.
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and torches.
Later there was worst salad.
With frequent melodies, Silvia spoke Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school court before the rehabilitation to the Kirchstraße is to be set again on the reconstruction plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the rehabilitation of the front school court, for the stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach provides Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Building Office to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a remedial concept for the old wall.
It is then intended to be made a cost calculation by experts, which will then be placed on the table to the Council for the decision and determining the further approach.
A decision on this is expected to fall in the next year.
After reconstruction, patching and planting of the old school house within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it must be reconstructed on ground and placed on new underbuilding in time as a follow-up measure.
The historical, a hundred years old delimiting wall of the old school court to the church street, is especially due to water and frost damage, as no drainage is available, need for sanitation and has a bowling forward.
Depth cracks in individual stones are evidence of wheat damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of crash.
A stand-proof wall is necessary for one of the students to use the school court, which has been done by the current firming work.
Originally, the school court rehabilitation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall analyzement, which was even used for films, will convey the country monument office.
If standards come from this page, the city of Brunlingen hopes for support from the monuments.
The students of the Brunlinger primary school, who are now being instructed again in a well-saved old school building with new aula, will soon be able to use the old school court.
Özdemir wants Jazz training in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now turned on.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the University of Music in Stuttgart," said Özdemir the Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classics are just part of Stuttgart's Jazz site.
In this way, Özdemir, who is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in Stuttgart in the Federal Day election on 22 September, is contrary to the Green-Roten National Government.
On the basis of an expert study, it forces a new order of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
The course of Jazz and Pop will then be transferred from the University of Music to the University of Mannheim.
US limit: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, detectors have discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, captured eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kg of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through the radar," said the U.S. prosecutor of the Southern California district, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006 more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the detectives assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took up about one year.
The railway system was equipped so that electrically operated vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel end.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 cm width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the conquered marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum punishment of life-long freedom withdrawal, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it's the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "depression" of the drug bands whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug capture in San Diego.
You would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one of the Mexicans, said it.
You have to expect penalties for up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first original mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned 794 together for the first time.
A document was produced in churches where both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event takes place in the place where both were mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be 1250 in July on a holiday weekend of 18 to 20 July.
We'll celebrate again.
On Friday with a festival, Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtal Hall.
At this festival weekend, the church houses are still a church celebration.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a composition on three dates for the city at the anniversary.
On June 21, together with the sunset celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12, in the arena with fireworks and on December 13, as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and dedicated in the anniversary year, the official date is last September week, 27 and 28 September.
At the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronic is also released.
"It should be a chronic not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's gisingen, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the gisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the communities.
The new history will then be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a customary evening at its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has on March 29 the festival banket and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
Leipferdingen's old work becomes 40 years old, Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates it as part of the well festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift document in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which were then courts.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250 year in 2014 is also 40 years later.
The Council takes the glaze system into the vision
Should the railway transit "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt to increase transport safety?
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over 220 000 euros for this.
The German railway will improve Kinzigtal railways next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of railway transitions - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles occur all over the world.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they have to participate with one third in the costs, the rest share rail and covenant.
Shiltach's master of town building Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the special features of the Bahn Transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnel wall there west of the railroad.
There, too, larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could stand in counter traffic without blocking the glaze.
Hence, greeters proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the subsequent road at the given time to ensure a smooth flow of transport.
This was discussed controversially in the municipality, since some Councils questioned the need for road dissemination: Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics on the point: "Would we have to handle so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas opposed: The "Hirschen" railway is used regularly for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberles bridge because they could not turn down the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
In view of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the transition "Am "Hirschen" could also be an important transport significance for a longer period.
The Councils agreed to examine the cost of the planned distribution of the road.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway transit was generally agreed with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in a way that the city could, if necessary, expand the subsequent road towards the Railway Road for encounter traffic to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway transition in the Gerberei Trait Wine could lead to a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhause Road".
The administration had examined the rail reconstruction plans by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhause was still possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclinations of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
Responsibilities for this are again the city as a road construction carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both wood deduction and declining work in the current state of expansion, the restructuring of the railway was not to be agreed, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transit is also significantly lower than the other railways, because it is directly at the centre of the stop point to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be broken in this place so far that no collision threatens.
Mostly, the restructuring of this railway was refused to accept, since the city of Schiltach had to "bath out" the problem of seating vehicles, said the Councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The body considers the restructuring of the railways "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets with other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are lives on some of them at least.
The selection is difficult: should you look for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or do you think that after earth-like planets, you might discover outdoor life?
These questions are just the responsibles of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are intended to promote research.
The establishment for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elites of European Space Research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them have now come into the closer choice.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, chopping up with researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Program Committee.
A total of four major questions, Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that circulate these stars - are still in the verbatim darkness.
A large infrared lescope in the All could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to examine this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will start in 2017, with 500 already known planet systems in our closer environment to be examined more precisely.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and thus look for "Biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide information on the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these operations can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class (this is the budget at about a half billion euros) for this issue.
The sun is intended to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three total L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The Sonde "Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer" is expected to begin their journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is intended to investigate the atmosphere of the planet and the ice moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The world's space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and so examine whether the known natural laws there are still valid.
Perhaps there are also abnormalities that could lead the physicians to a new theory, under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe originate and what is it?
13,7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the urgency.
Besides the common matter, of stars, planets and living beings like us, there are dark matters whose gravity combines galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerated.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid during the first seconds of the urgency, or what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission whose start for 2020 is planned.
With a special telescope, the sun is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow references to the nature of dark matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances of granting as a L mission are, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a demanding approach to detect gravity waves.
This includes physicists' changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisa could do this, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a two- or three-soned detector that is stationed in the All.
Unlike plants on earth, he could also demonstrate gravity waves that were created at the first knall and thus provide new knowledge of the creation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There are already proposals for sample back transport from Mars, for the research of moon, venus and asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany as regards U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has explained that he is willing to travel to Berlin and proclaim before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not give any answers to their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Strøbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum was given to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, he writes: “If the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a violation of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinions with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
Saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to let the charge against him fall.
The charge raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and stealing of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany are stressed by the claims that the NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Mr Oppermann, Member of the Secretary Committee, declared that there should be an opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, “without endangering him and destroying all relations with the United States”.
Strobele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia when he left the country.
When Snowden says in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is 'safe' there, says the Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "ernstige and ongoing" persecution campaign that expelled him from his home.
However, it is affected by the global reaction to "my act of political opinion".
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians, including in the United States, have declared the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a debt in the public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved".

Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to stick on their flight luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was read that passengers should keep the whole dossier.
The new fee applies to handbags in the baggage above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars are calculated when the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid only at the flight step.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travellers to take care of the payment in front of them.
“We do not want to calculate this sum,” she explained.
Airlines began to demand fees for the first and second baggage, in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stopped as much as possible in their handbags, resulting in that the baggage bags are often overfilled above the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money.
It's about the most faithful customers from frontiers, which had clearly expressed that it's getting more and more difficult to find place in the department above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage for free at the frontier flight, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the flight.
The new handbaggage fee of frontier will only enter into force in the summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers frequently blame baggage supplements and other fees, but airlines are happy to take back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage should cost money and passengers pay this service if they wish it.
Many at the Wall Street view the new luggage fees as signs that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most of them have left the fingers of fees for handbags until now.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for handbags and later allgiant Air followed, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline Advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbaggage fee brings in Spirit 50 million US dollars each year.
Sorensen, who formerly had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently fled with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the flight stairs if passengers were faced with the unusual handbaggage fee of the company.
“The boarding process was one of the most smoothly experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see dentistry and handheld discussions at the flight stairs.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as smeared.”
Frontier follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice could keep the whole box and be filled with coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had in 2008 attempted to demand money for refreshment drinks, but seven months later, after complaining passengers and no other large society had been withdrawn.
Frontier step to raise fees for the handbag if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase instead of through an online travel office.
However, frontiers have been the largest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half as many multi-fly miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A third-party flight with frontiers over 1,000 miles brings customers only 250 miles away.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively on the website of frontier spots for direct purchase.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The income decreased by 9 per cent and the flight capacity decreased nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, as we read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to manage the finances of frontiers in the context of the sale of the company.
Speaking Words From the Bible
Some 40 women visited the last breakfast of women this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipality house was "Speakers from the Bible" and "Speaking from the Middle Ages".
Sita Köhler, the chairman of the Council of the Church of Municipalities, entered the Bible proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Speakers contain wiseness, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called words such as: Be watchful of wooden eye, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone whose Lord is in sleep, wash his hands in innocentness.
Several times, the referendum also gave her listeners advice on what the vocabulary was about.
The Mediterranean talks accepted by Christian Dehner: All good things are to make three, blue, to cut something.
She declared the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges in the past".
To conclude, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the guests of the breakfast round, Mayor Mayor Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for uninstructed people in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Lake Plate starts a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already uninstructed in the industry will be qualified for professionals for hotels and guests over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with grades," said Carmen Wiechert from the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hospitals, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Industrial and Commercial Chambers in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Guest Places Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday that an error has lamed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unreachable for a few hours tonight, since an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spyaging agency in an email message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
A speaker of the NSA had previously explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of Hacktivists claimed to have lamed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site will be flooded with site calls until the servers are overloaded and the website will be collapsed.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not to intervene in the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such agency), is now found in the bright light of the public and looks after the disclosures that have been made known in recent months about its extensive monitoring programme in abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service kicked up initial speculations about the fact that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
In October, the number of people without job was slightly decreased by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3,1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Felder-Builder, vice-president of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
For many companies have so far reacted to the behaviour of settings.
One reason for this is, according to the fielder builder: "We have little professionals in craft, health and old care."
Annual periods have also been offered for staff in the hotel and guesthouse industries since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Advertising Journal of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Profit losses for bombards by decline in delivery numbers and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent reduction in the net profit after he had been pressured by declining orders and deliverys to aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway parks.
Bombardiers seated in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his brand new plane of CSeries and did not provide new information on whether the plane could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule in the next September.
At the test flight in the juvenile, one and a half months ago, only three more starts have been followed so far, so it appears questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a course crash of more than eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analytist at National Bank Financial, reduced its evaluation from "outperform" to "sector" in order to ensure that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Two were expected to be weaker delivery numbers in aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed from the margin development in the transport sector,” said Dorksen in a customer letter.
We believe that bombardiers will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresss.
However, if no new orders are given in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptic to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries fly series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after monthly delays for the first time in September.
However, to date, mandatory orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and wanting to see whether the claims of the company regarding fuel efficiency and the cost-saving potential of the new fertilizer aircraft apply.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also insured analyticals and media on Thursday that the programme is in the schedule.
“The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the time of the flight, soil tests and software updates were performed.
Every manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, what we have done.
This is what happens during the entire flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, was called by company side.
Nevertheless, analytists remain skeptical whether twelve months after the first customer can run a CSeries plane.
Bombardier explained that it checks the planning for the launch (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it seems to be in line with the internal planning of bombardiers – strengthens our view that the launch is moving to the first quarter of 2015”, said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cent per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cent unchanged.
The turnover dropped slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analytists had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer suggests that he delivered 45 planes in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net exhibitions fell from 83 planes to 26.
The contracts in the air and space parks amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30th and was thus unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the field of air and space, the results were within the framework of our rules, but the low entrance of contracts and market conditions were totally disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
The sales in the air and space parks fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this savings have increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The contract in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30, and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolving problems in some large contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the bombardier share left by 8.5 per cent and was 4.83 canadian dollars after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board would switch Patrick Pichette into the Board.
The Brazilian embrace SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's narrow rivalry, reported a 10% decline in the quarterly profit on Thursday.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police detection must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, forwarded information to subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug baron against a large police detection because he was afraid that his secret drug abuse could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on the detection of its activities in drug trafficking, after being compromised by his own cocaine disease.
The lawyer who was praised by criminalists as “first-class” with the nickname “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a former drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were at a dinner of the lawyer chamber.
The investigations revealed that thista regularly consumed drugs of Class A after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the framework of a large investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine at the value of 1.5 million pounds and $200,000 cash in a series of house searches.
Thista, 42, transmitted information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Thista, who works for the Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and condemned at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for disability of justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership at a previous interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and where the drugs were placed with a cleanness of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's waste tones.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was announced that this was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but argued to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "advocate secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and took a hair sample from him.
At the police interrogation, he stated that he operated both under his private address and at the workplace a office and clients would call him home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called on important stakeholders of the drug trade, of which he had previously represented some of them, after significant arrests and informed the detectives of what they knew about them.
State prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken. ”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defense because he has joined too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was no doubt legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and Mandant.
He resisted police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
This brought Mr Ditta to question his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Thista pointed out every wrong behavior and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but do that immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Here Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependency led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive for the motives of leading members of organised crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
This has declined this trust and has tried to get behind the façade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five and thirty more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug crime.
On his website, Ditta published a field of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer Mandant in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
In order to conclude the celebrations of his 160-year-old existence, the songcranz Dunningen will embrace two religious services with the "German fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which the spectators enthusiasticed this year, the songcrane will enrich two religious services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert for the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10:15 p.m. in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a religious musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The fair is listed in the context of the services, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the bladder group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis softens confidence
For example, the elections to the 2015 parish municipality will change fundamentally in the Haslach (SE) seal care unit.
Then there is only one common parish town for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be altered and it is to the prerogatives to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly evident: the skepticism of the new one is slowly slowing down, but seeing a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish community, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the seal care team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted directives for sealing units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Then, as a church community, the SE Haslach will form a public law body that enters into the rights and duties of the six church communities so far.
There will be only one common parish municipality and a foundation council in which the priest's power is represented.
Each parish shall be represented by at least two selected members, in which six parishes are formed on-the-spot so-called municipality teams.
Their task will be to promote the church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of each parish municipality then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods in the parishes remain connected.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the general community.
In view of the large investments planned, whose commitment to bear all the parishes, there was great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone were invested," said Haslach's Prime Ministerial Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the seal care unit Schutterwald-Neureiden.
They had made themselves a job in 2006, "One, five remains" and had to find that it was not that easy at all.
The bodies of Haslacher Selesorgeeinheit then responded to the questions on the future composition and size of the common parish community as well as the practical work of the municipality team.
The preparations will be concreted at further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, Pfarrgemeinderat Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seal care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the power becomes more expensive
Pfullendorf's citizens have to pay higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the townworks, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the South-KURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorf family accounts for 70 to 90 euros additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC conversion from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This turnover will be re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity tracks.
These count the additional costs resulting from the change in energy, which they can raise by turnover over the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf city works form the last joint in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company was even based on a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out from an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, where the number would rather be near the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes an ampel just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light mark is defective.
Then what do you want to do - ride with red?
Having waited long enough for a red ampel and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart Advocate Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "required", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises you to endure at least five minutes before a disturbance of the ampel is expected.
Anyone who continues in spite of red light, however, must be clear that he is blamed for an accident caused by it.
Those who patience less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Oberlandegericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ampel after about three minutes of durability and had to be responsible for a violent red light violation.
Because the ampel was not defective, but jumped on green a little later.
A ban on driving remained to him because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
The Community is pleased with a solid budget
Always when it comes to meetings on the budget, mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The municipal sack in Hertwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have no longer known the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about € 7.6 million higher than planned.
The excess of the administrative budget is also approximately EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
In particular, the surplus is due to higher commercial tax revenues and the share of income taxes in the Community.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the €1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher supply from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since less investments have been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, refunds have also been increased.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"So a work is not just shaking out of the sleeve," Gerster commended in view of the annual account.
He and the municipalities were vividly delighted in the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxous, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to abstain from high lifts.
However, according to Gerster, many of the grants have been reduced by the land.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation boxes.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain lifts.
"The issue of lifting rates must be looked at, as in the coming years investments we would like to support," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story is nearly twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his men's singing units on the stage.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the choir that has been won more than lovely still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his association, he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Reference in charge of the Cäcilien Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, delivered to him - since the choir is also a church chor - a document of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues delivered to him the document of the German Chorverband as well as a graved zinner.
In addition to honour, the 31st autumn festival was in usual railways: With the MGV Betra, the Songerkranz Salzstätten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the full-margers had loaded a colorful mix of various chors and vocal styles, which the about 400 visitors had.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with pleasant songs like "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, their brothers".
Their honourful singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for honor a little bit more - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jägerwerving" by Julius Wengert, "Avery, far away" by Hubert Goisern, as well as the people's song "When you walk through the valley".
The song crane of Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its female group - the "Impulschor" - provided the female rate of the festival.
The mixed choir was kidnapped with the neapolitan people "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also took back in foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back with "What is the Swebb?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to home filled, where the Fullmaringer Music Association gave the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small advancing program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer, a casperl theatre, and read a few stories that the children were busy for the afternoon.

Kenyan press is upset by controversial media law
“We are in a terrible situation and we must ask ourselves: What does Parliament prevent from simply eliminating judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper which considers the draft law not constitutional.
“The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most renowned independent radio stations and news sites Kenyas.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be predominant because it is a longer arm of the government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and to return to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star, the government is taking the new law “media effectively into a wrestling grip” and, on the other hand, The Standard, democracy and freedom of speaking in Kenya has suffered“a severe stroke” and called the draft“draconic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the course of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew up the wrath of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the crime claimed to have robbed the luxury shopping centre.
Police director David Kimaiyo responded to the order of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media call.
According to the new law, media houses can be charged with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenian Schillingen and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a punishment is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single punishment can push most radio broadcasters into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on the "living blood sphere" of Kenya.
If they put the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they want unpunished.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians themselves, they bring the country into bankruptcy and we return to the time of the hunters and collectors,” he commented.
The Kenian legislators have already in the past raised public problems.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the national remuneration commission and re-enforced their defective salaries of about 532.000 shilling free of charge per month – they are one of the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
At the importance of the city and the football club, the official dedication celebration for the artificial grass sports lot despite the cold whirlwind and rain was nothing.
A more pleasant hour of celebration had probably all wanted last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
Thus all of them had the look that came without rainscreen or couldn't hold one for any reason.
It was the musicians who embraced the festival, as did some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC Chairman of Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks to all mayor Walter Klump, who has been very engaged in the implementation of the project, was the municipality, the involved companies and the members of the United Nations who took part.
Especially here Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The calm pensioners moved 400 square metres of patches for the new ways.
This remarkable official commitment was also worthwhile to the Landtagsminister Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were spoken for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Badian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, which announced a donation for the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klumpf reminded us that in the spring and autumn, increasing whiteness-related influences added to the original grass place so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first thoughts to solve the problem when the construction of a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school at the Salinen Lake was considered.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the construction of a artificial breeding site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago when the FC took over the barbecue in heritage, promised a cost participation of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the site and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipality decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000, chumping.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial grass square took place on June 4th.
During the construction phase that lasted over three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the subjects of internal and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, membership and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the group of migration and integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
It should be the subject of double nationality, where both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for a decision to quit - the Union refuses a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda of the meeting on this Friday, the SPD understood its no to a car-maut required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for multi-running and thus ecologically contraproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for the topic of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There are threatened roads from the roads, which are already accidental difficulty.
The introduction of a wall for all cars would also be only a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is the risk that later the compensation for Germans will be deleted," he said.

Car drivers severely injured in accidents
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen has been severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from moss was on the way to Grefrath by 21.15 p.m. with her car on the champion's outdoor ring.

The railway had to be locked during the accident recording, it continued.
Vienna Airport will take away passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future there will be no more throughsages like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speakers' reviews are thus disappearing - the noise mill is to be so significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxing atmosphere is the goal of this renewal.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting up of throughsages affecting individuals.
Thus, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already abandoned noise calls.
The loss of these throughsights - averagely showing about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - will make it more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transmissions have been observed relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flights or departure times is going a little down here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake train with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn festival on the Coldhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, starts the highlander game at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are raised in the Coldhof in Swabian.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree tribe throwing, hive casting and carrying water removers.
Four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilos heavy.
"It doesn't come on the wide," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The tribe needs to be thrown off vertically, to be overthrowd once, and then come to lying right now.
This is assessed with most points.
When sheeping iron, it depends on the precision of the target.
From eight meters distance is thrown on a pflock.
Skill and strength must prove the participants in carrying more than 50 meters of water.
Time and a quantity of water in a buttch are measured at the end.
From every "Clan" or team, two may then participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prices.
Training can be trained from 10 o'clock.
The desire is a suitable clothing, for example, the contesters can get into the rock.
But also Swedish cargo is allowed.
For "outfit" the jury still forgives a few bonus points.
You can log in until an hour before the competition starts.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander gambling and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action at the festival site on Saturday.
In the evening the blasmic friends come at their expense.
At 19 a.m., the birabohemian blasmusic from Schömberg forms the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays great Polkas and marvels.
However, their stock includes emotional walzers and a saturated Big Band sound.
With it, he will be known as the singing host and blackworst baron Heinz Koch from time to time under the ribbens.
In Dornhan, he has already occurred at the Christmas market and in the fools.
On Sunday, the music facility enters Leinstetten for the early kick, from 14 p.m. the Böffeningen cup is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival come out.
Intake is already on Friday the stoplacker party with DJ Ralf.
Further program points are on Saturday and Sunday, among other things, the old-time and sliding meetings, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Further attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sharing of sheep.
Specially for children there is a strike zoo, a strawhhüpfburg, a tractor ride (under guidance) and a tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Promotional Association Multipurpose Hall, the Ski Club and the Tractor Friends "Tünnkäpselle".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegan food requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, purged tofu with plant wheat is a quarker set.
Others call the Vegetarian Federation for the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Federation Germany suggests a number of vegan alternatives at the World Vegan Day on November 1th:
Pure plant margins are a good alternative to butter, yoghurt let you replace with soyyoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, port, mantle or rice milk can be used.
Retrofitable plant snake substitutes conventional snails.
There are also plant alternatives for eggs.
For example, a half-depressed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a dining spoon painted leather seed plus three dining spoons of water are suitable for it.
For example, a mixture of a tea spoon of back powder, a dining sphere of food strength and three dining beads of mineral water becomes luminous.
But also 50 grams of Soja yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest gymnasium were acquainted with the American large city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went immediately to the Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which is a special excitement in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but trusted in the motto "The city is not sleeping" the day was decided at the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Freedom Statue could be reached with a ferry and climbed at foot.
Then it went through the financial centre around the Wall Street to the Memorial Site of September 11th.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373 meters high outlook platform of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic driving of the New York Streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay shortly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their guest families and experienced the school everyday at Weymouth High School.
This year, too, a Hubertus fair is celebrated on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the Church of St. Marien at Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather disrespectless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Lieach.
The Hunthorn Blaser Group of the Huntdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth muses on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, original French melodies.
The blases carry riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogmaids on sleeping hunting musical.
The celebrated fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed look shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu, it is called a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of visiting the named café at the circuit of Kleve in view of the University of Rhein-Waal, it must not remain at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café, with the beautiful name, has exactly this goal: to make real stay not only thoughtful, but constantly experienceable again and again.
Because it's just fun and just beautiful.
A look into the interior life at the look 8 gives the viewer a good feeling on Anhieb.
The high-modern but not-cool café official looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner admire the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have made themselves a name before the opening of the tasty café at the turnover: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
The sympathetic café lovers are hoping more audience from moving to Kleve.
Not least also through the university.
"When we do not have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner emphasizes.
Rather, the two students here want to address young students as well as senior and all age classes between them.
Speaking of Café lovers.
The sympathetic owners are behind the coffee genuss.
Enjoy the fragrance of the hot bride in the most diverse variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der stellt the Cappuccino drinker.
"For that, a baguette - that's my thing," she told the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also a ring-night evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a profound fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always speak to only those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore events will rather be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
To be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the list in Kleve.
The road that grows more and more into a gastronomy miles.
For the joy of many clevers, the guests from close and remote and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the conciliation room of the "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonic interaction in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation feast is always the proper festivity to do honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener welcomed the special award "Songers of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also turned some rounds for us, for our warm thanks," said the Chairman of the Choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and choir samples by means of activities were given this year to the Chorleiter Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the Chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and the last year's "Songer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Place five occupied note office Artur Brückner.
A special thanks beauty was directed by the board to the team of Confederation General Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once more had magicated a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" will always meet at its regular choir samples on Tuesday at 7:45 a.m. in the uniting room.
"New vocal voices are warmly welcome to us at any time," said Schlotmann.
UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a number of new objectives to replace the millennium development targets to combat poverty, announced twelve years ago.
In front of the UN Summit for Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the precipitation of "sustainable development targets" to replace the millennium targets that end in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared, at the summit, that the time had come to “think beyond national interests”.
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to adopt a process to be agreed with universal, sustainable development objectives,” he said.
“These objectives will be based on our progress from millennium development targets and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium goals."
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory since four days, the handball superliants continue to have a good mood.
This makes trainer Tomasz Malmon no doubt at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know how to taste such a victory," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third league reserve from Fredenbeck hasn't even ripped any trees at the moment, Malmon warns on the front of the show finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, the SG-Coach clarifies whether there will be further reinforcement from the first", says the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must in any case rise compared to the previous appearances.
Above all, in coverage work and during the switch game, it was nevertheless happier at last.
Chances must also definitely be improved.
That is why I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of conflicts between influenceful personalities
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to agree peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the quantity on Thursday at the capital's independence site.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a reputable rebel movement that was initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later by the Apartheid Government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Contract, she became an opposition party.
Analytists believe that it is unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, much is at stake, since the discovery of huge gas in the northwest coast and coal camps in the next few years could bring investments from more than 50 billion US dollars of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The reigning Frelimo Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blamed each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent conflicts by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Highburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo base points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speaker to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflicts and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Contrary to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself to be a "misser" who "will use all his remaining powers to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
Towards the FT, he declared that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to reopen negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have only contributed little to fixing the tensions that have been fired by a number of conflicts this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) here that collapse the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a teacher at the Open University and a Mosambik expert.
None of them is good in negotiation and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a violent movement to achieve concessions and financial advantages by the government.
Renamos' electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member of Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose retirement comes when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he wants no transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the Presidential Office," said Mazanga.
It's unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has committed disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred miles north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga retarded the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
“The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
“Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable streets again,” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “exemplars of life”, says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance against smart tricks” and the Artus Legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “to far too wild, too disgusting and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools”, so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “careful selection” of old age-time works.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that in authors and teachers who are “excessively educational” children would “completely turn off” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “swelled”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel Saxony and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible.”
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be underwhelmed, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again to the courtyard
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob had his seat of age in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic at the very short-term scene.
From arrival on the granting of honourable citizenship to his death, Drewbook Author and Hansjakob actar Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that was very welcomed under Cornelia's government.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and broken time from youth to nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once more in his parade role as the great son of the city shined.
Stielet, with the two-spin and the "Black Forest Füchsen" of Erich Becher from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with plenty of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understanded it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and gave her in Mimic and Gestikken unhearted life.
Between each play scene, the Mühlenbacher farmer chapel played suitablely selected musical pieces and rounded the performance.
In order to grant honour to the honour, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave his honor, who, in representation of the former official inhabitant Hättich together with a part of the city council, made his presence.
Their arrival then made the three-king singers, which led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own three-king time will be alive again."
With their song "O Jesulein" they rejoiced the audience in the courtyard as well as the Storch Day children with their loud "out, out".
His criticism at the official church had at that time expressed Hansjakob as his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homehouse, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A calm spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and many praiseful words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the League remaining of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer's sports declined have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard process, then there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project rejects an application for a possible background.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said Ex-National player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 sets up the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt.
However, a first breathing was not from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until it is established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May, Opstiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic Federal Liga suitability.
Until now, the Rheinlanders have been rejected the license twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haierloch: Evening church moves to the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150-year-old existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public topics on Sunday, October 27, the evening church.

Snowden could also pronounce in Russia
The former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. sphere.
Representatives of the Federal General State Advocate may either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
The Agency informed Interfax on the request of non-declared circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, said it.
A trip of Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Since Germany is a allyer of the United States, Snowden threatened the delivery there, it continued

Black shimmes the stone coal on the warehouse in front of the dew.
Spread or load the coal here if necessary.
Whenever the envelopes are moved, a shrilled warning noise will end over the ground.
"The signals serve safety and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is far-reaching - and so there were already some complaints from people from the urban north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the subjects, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now important to keep the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he also set up open dialogue with its neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else in front of the site.
With the extension of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to put on carbon imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres deepened liegewanne form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be completed here.
"In this year we want to knock the 3 million tonnes brand," Schrell said.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to power plants in the domestic country.
If the GDF Suez power plant continues to go to the network, about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's Basketballer despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to smuggle huge optimism in the basketballers of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning the best team of Europe in the past two years," Balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at title defendant Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European king class, Münchners sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not cleared enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the piece of art, a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end, to transform into a leadership before Piräus gave the game a turn again.
"We have incredibly fought back against the two-time Euroleague Champion, but then made lightweight mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful advertisers of the Munks who had celebrated significant victories in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish captain targetona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, varieties artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on the Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation was expanded, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
In the life of Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-up Institute Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more successful until they were known to appear in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year's event has been held by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy feasibility event for armies in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known about rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a Sitcom in the cable TV (the ironic-slipping fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has its own skitch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at "Saturday Night Live" as well as in "Parks and Recreation", although she is most known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American Comedy.
One of the largest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed as a prestigious television and film director and as an inofficial comedy historyr.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks: "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will appear a week before the next atomic meeting with the five United Nations ethics and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, one now has an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to remove the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear operator would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids kill game chambers with Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
On Tuesday, with Machetes and knifes, they stabbed the 11-year-old and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a working quarter of football in front of their apartments.
The body was discovered the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the younger woman who had taken them should say she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly named a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered to a psychiatric youth institution.
Containers must go to prison
Due to exploiting human trafficking, restrainting, threat, injury and dangerous body injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former federal army soldier, who worked as a doorman after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts which he sent to the strike after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He maintained the revenues of the women who purchased for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he brought them to various boardelles in the southwest.
There he took part of her surveillance in order to control her revenue.
In court, the prosecutor claimed first that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in a explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a restricted debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court had to hear no more of the injured women.
As reported by a cripo officer, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking were identified after a first advertising by telephone surveillance measures.
The interrogated conversations had been characterized by high aggression.
In later hearings, the injured had confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness who had discovered blue spots throughout the body has not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", which considers violence and exploitation in this metre as normal.
The prosecutor regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has resolved from these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the arrest," he said.
Oil price continues after up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price also continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that increases in the energy-funging manufacturing sector of China.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December were dropped to $96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a decline in prices of 5.8 percent in October.
The large raw oil offer has loaded prices over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Ministry of Energy explained on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million Barrel last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million Barrel.
On Friday, however, two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing showed a stronger demand.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth has increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent varieties, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to 108,58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-fresh directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-fresh programme (“continuation and searching”) of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until the city's appeal was decided.
The judge had sentenced in August that the city was violating the Constitution by the way the program for the persistence and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city made a appeal against its assessment and the appropriate remedy measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body to support the police in amending their Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday the Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the requisite suspension.
The appeal report declared that the judge must be discharged from the case because she infringed the Code of Conduct for American Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyity; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had sentenced police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted in an unreasonable way black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in fourths where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after police control.
A oral negotiation on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fresh strategy was criticised by a number of civil rights invoices.
Controls of this kind have been in different forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls increased during the period of office of the pardelous mayor Michael Bloomberg to a permanent height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities submitted a complaint which developed into a collective complaint.
Advocates of amendments to the NYPD's stop-and-fish programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way other police officers use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would slow down the morals of the police, but not crime; also would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police, which is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been disappeared in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice that was constitutional, but only the type of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeded in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Beduin wisdom, the first president Wolfgang described Henne the history and fascination of the "helping hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first Chairman of Henne reported detailedly the work of the United Nations.
In 2004 he was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the Gynäkologe Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on the site.
During the talks, pictures of the operations were shown on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could imagine the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the United Nations was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, former OB of Nagold, had proposed to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic position and now plans, according to Henne, to operate in advisory function in the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, an evil district on the edge of the capital - officially in the record period of nearly one week.
Her also mentioned a new Mother-Kid Hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth hospital is to be removed in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medicine, such as her, for example acceleration against Burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medicines, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered abundantly local coloring by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles built to the mobile goat set and the experiences of the stamheimer musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget through the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it would not be far to Africa.
Coulson used telephone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson claimed to try to confirm a false tip about the affair of Charles Clarke, then minister of the Interior.
Advocate Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court of Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court heard.
“In the opinion of the public prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who is standing in front of the apartment of people and hopes to take it to a fresh act, but one who likes people to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said to use NotW three methods to investigate stories: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "If he knew about it."
The rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the feature redaction of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't disappear your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three events was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The detectives also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the researchers ran, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, where they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, the former head reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following contents: “I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Inner Minister David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a married woman because of an affair when he himself had been lied with Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argued to have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In fact, the French football will, from protest against the planned rich tax, go through the first strike since 1972.
An announcement ends indefinitely.
In conflict with rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a sackgasse after a failure to settle.
President François Hollande received on Thursday in the Pariser Élysée Palace of Association and Association Representatives and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to remove the football from the planned 75% tax on income from more than one million euros per year, which all the companies in the country are supposed to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced at the end of November will now be drawn through, the Head of the Association of Profics (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The playdays employed between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus terminated.
No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," opened Mayor Jens Huußler the Civil Information Event on the Highwater Protection Concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had come to the municipality hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns, and to introduce ideas.
Hüssen said clearly: "The final decisions are the members of the municipality."
The highwater that Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 had been an incredible event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, said Hüssen.
A river area investigation had been conducted with the neighbouring community Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the highwater protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of so many cultivated lands as possible is the goal," said Hüußler.
It is based on the planning of protection against a weather service, according to the German weather service, statistically every 100 years to be expected.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surplus.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The waters that had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 were a 1000-year-old flood.
"A absolute protection is not available, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said Hüssen.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereas the municipality can expect national subsidies of about 70 per cent.
However, hummers pointed out that there is only the promotion if a overall approach is being implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A tough planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection that was presented in the municipality last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flow of the fluid Irm from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the highwater protection concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no longer dams and refugees were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist in the designation of the designated engineering agency of Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economic solution was to be found, says Joachim forest of forest and corbe.
Untreatment was prevailing in the land of the old place, which, even in normal thunder rain, has always suffered from a overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, householders pointed out that the directives for channel systems are other than for the protection of high waters and this cannot be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be tolerated.
Increasing the dimension of wastewater channels would consume millions.
Heavily injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two car drivers were severely injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but at first, they could not say much about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old steward of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, where the woman was so toughly embossed that the firearm needed hardly a half hour to liberate her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accident remained unclear at first.
Both disadvantaged people arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route remained locked about two hours.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Amazingly the relatives in the outer: the steaking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fiodor M. Dostojewski with his massive oeuvre is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, which is definitely regarded as something in its own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne Publisher, the Haffmans Cassette with the 118 stories distribute two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, safety wheat and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added his brain.
He understood early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blad Runner" problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" comes from the year 1956, it streams the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is here developed, "pre-crime", that is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks horrifyingly like ours, mutants are looking into the future - and the police are approaching.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a penalty camp full of Pesudo criminals." They read time flows.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented in practice.
Dick's story seems like the blue out for the anti-terror laws and the hearing noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obamas Drohnen philosophy and praxis also work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of the police regrets that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the state.
Then the overseer will be monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Take mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchasing, but build themselves on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means, always, to get closer to the truth.
Proclamation of leagues around Merkel in Russia
The former US Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. Spæhaffäre about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Advocate may either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the Agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Green-Bundesday delegate Hans-Christian Strobele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police hub screw fled deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Interior Secret Service, it should photograph the roof of the US External Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again in September argued that the United States did not use opportunities for a foreign spy, "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profit."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower, has started publishing his filling horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business heads are no longer sure whether they can take the director into account.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spioned the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the companies paranoia to a new maximum for state surveillance.
The phase to pass brought the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkels was related to the phone, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come into vision, business management is surely also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now represented a nearly as high risk as China when it comes to industry spying and data stealing, such a survey published by the EY consultant company in July.
However, there was no evidence in the documents sucked by Snowden that the United States has transmitted the operating secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern about the lack of certain IT and Internet opportunities in the EU and should reduce their dependency on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
On the Bundestag, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open it again ...
"This is not how this works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT industry.
Yet, scope and technical refinances have shocked the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden discoveries, which had seen the largest spy risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware of the fact that data stored in the United States is subject to the case law and are therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, rejected the disclosure of US data mining activities with Prism about 10 percent of the non-residents of the United States plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Vice-President of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven’t existed yet a year ago – it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in this legal space?”
Many German corporate leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at every price.
That economic spying takes place is not surprising.
It's always been so.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans spy us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate management normally does not commend the countermeasures taken, because it provides advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been involved in the fact that taking a free USB stick on a fair or the unmonitored lounge of a laptop in the hotel room is not easy to say.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Executive Board of Automobile Manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a Executive Meeting so that they can not be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid handles when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handys are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to Hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective nics.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to protect operational secrets effectively from unauthorised access”, the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns their own companies against economic spionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimates in February France, Russia and Israel were registered behind China on rank two of the countries used to purchase economic data from the Hacking.
A member of the Board of Directors of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Home Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very accurately that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy out their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery to do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The Retro look has held back.
This starts with the wedding clothes.
White is Muss, best covered or in cream.
In front of them are often armed and closed with sticky clothes, often with a sleeve, on the back, they go down the back and often end in a sleeve.
However, the spirits distinguish, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
In men, the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen cream-colored or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the locale, was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the remise.
Then whoever wants to go ahead with the cart, Your Link has an offer for that.
"But kittens are also popular for boys' girls' divorce," he says.
Romantics are also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Foto" - i.e. recording series at special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Hundreds of successful
For repeated times, the athletes of the dogfriends were successful at a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in candle with two dogs; with his herd Sandy, he reached 94 points in the class beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley, he brought it with 87 points to place twelve.
Susi Höpp, with her Woody in Class 1, set up the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled ringermatte at his high school tour hall are convinced that their son was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat, which was behind the tribulation in the school tour hall.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which doubts the family of the 17-year-old.
“You are convinced that their son was murdered,” explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
“You believe that it is unnecessary of any logic, that it violates the laws of physics and the healthy human mind,” said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be disfellowshipped to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their Son.
“Your son went to school to learn and returned in the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal detection of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe that there is an adequate basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died as a result of the consequences of “position-related embroidery”.
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation on Johnson's death, he will be commissioning the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in the south of Georgia ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos that the detectives have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video records contained evidence of how he died.
Publishing CDC Allergy Policy for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives for dealing with food allergies from children to schools.
These are the first such directives published by the U.S. Government, as the number of educational children with food allergy increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergics.
The distribution of food allergy among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergy and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislatives in the Federal States have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more prosperous.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something pressed on my tongue”, “My tongue feels like a hair is on it” or“My tongue is crushed”.
Parents of intersexual children can choose “sex indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognised for children born with unclear genitals.
Newbornes are no longer assigned star male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer declare sex to such children, but they can indicate "undefined" or "non-defined" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overhaast decisions regarding operations for gender allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination of intersexual people.
A intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, "I am neither man nor woman."
I'm staying the flickwork created by doctors, embarrassed and filled with scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group falling under the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, thrombosis (ears or heads) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that you should use the best available gender allocation information if a destination is not possible and not wait for the child’s psychological and physical development before you – if at all – decide for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “snipple for a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can take a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sex-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These qualities were demonstrated in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statue, priorities of sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of discrimination that exposes intersexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not the gender image, boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “generationless” person worldwide after a court had allowed the lifelong retention of a “undefined” gender status.
Deutsche Ausweis neben M and W will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Interior Ministry.
In the neighbouring France, gender topics are still controversial, so a message message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the Strict Catholic Country signed a petition that the “sexual theory” should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online website also spoke against the German law, with the reason: “If the world is scattered into a new state, where the gender represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone, she would find it better if babys were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parent’s behavior is stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your own child,” she said on the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sexes were called Heraphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine viewed the gender as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilded.
But now the ethical foundations of a surgery are doubted after now knowing how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they have assigned.
“In the midst of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals is based on Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who felt that the gender was formal.
He interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, arguing, social and environmentally-related attacks – such as parents rearing a child – and acted as a male or female person.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966 his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been distinguished in a preposted circumcision, to castrate the child completely, and to remove his heads, and then raise him up as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not,” said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
In the 1990s, however, survivors of these sexual operations, who are “not happy with the result,” have come to the public.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-defined genitals.
The doctors were unaware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the heads were removed in surgery shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosteron injections and was removed from his breasts.
The surgery has made him unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be seen as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the judicial group of Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law “in order to stamp and stigmatize” can be encouraged.
“Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to ‘not assign to the child’,” she explained.
We fear that this is a favourable intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we don't know how the law will take effect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports the Australian law, because “it enables adults to recognise as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual distinction and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "advocate" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptive effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggsticks.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is unfruitable, however, hopes to be able to get a child by adopting or a limemother.
“The law gives parents space, so that they do not have to make decisions overwhelmingly,” said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clarify things and thus give them time before they write "human" or "wife".
In this way everything is okay – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you don't have to take an overhauling operation that can no longer be undoed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents move around because they think they would not do the right thing,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shooting from car
Unknown people have hurt a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when they were shot from a car.
On the Thursday evening, in Genthin, the killers probably had fired an air pressure gun to a group of children.
That was what the police informed in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The killers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The police detected it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice for egg-shaped children, which cast them against house-facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately, no damage would have occurred.
In the city area, some Sylvesterballs have also been burned, but there has also been no damage here.
One inhabitant in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was integrated with clothing paper and his cycling blends were disappeared.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his cycling blends in the immediate vicinity of everyone, why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spines?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spine on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spider phobie, but the concern that in the age of not being able to cope with the many stairs of the house and the apartment, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
A book from her recently appeared on the subject 'Happy living in age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going at all in age', she begins to tell.
When she moved over 20 years ago with her husband to the maisonette apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that it is one of the few people who are contemplating the topic of 'women in age'.
Most of them are expelled as long as they can.
"There's always going to be the other ones," she says shaking.
Only if the pressure of suffering is really high, you think about it.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architectin presents 17 living models for self-defined living in age.
'Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who could afford the rest of their age in Tuscany or the Bretagne should always consider that he could become sick too.
And 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you also unite in the Dolce Vita', the literary author recalls a volunteer.
Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often quoted pensioner WG.
In the age, everyone has so their ticks and Macken
'For me there would be nothing like this,' she means with an eyewitch.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In the age, you just need your backing rooms,' so Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude a senior-owned community.
But this would have to happen differently from in the classic students' WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest, she believes.
With this view, at least it is not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as it goes', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the capital of the country.
Your service advises people around the topic 'become older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions only in order to remain in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation of Product Tests.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment barrier free.
Ries recommends that all who are working on the old aged rebuilding of their house or apartment should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists to rebuild old age.
Even in the apartment, this can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior architectin is clearing up.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment for age and thus free of barrier, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Though you could install a staircase lift within the apartment, which is also plunged with stairs to the door of the apartment, it would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before she moves, she grazes more than before the spin at her apartment door.
The United States wants to continue to prosecute Snowden in criminal law.
The United States has not changed their attitude to the former U.S. Secret Officer Edward Snowden.
He is still being persuaded to have transmitted unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he had to commit a criminal proceedings in the United States, said the speaker of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Nor would Snowden's recent statements change it.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Politician Hans-Christian Strobele had appealed to the United States to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki underlined that it is a parliamentarian's statement, not a German government member.
Secret Service Thüller Edward Snowden is in principle prepared for a conversation with German authorities.
Firstly, however, he wants to know his situation cleared.
This has been cleared by the former NSA staff seeked by the United States in an unadvised letter, which was published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Strobele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and led on to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the General Bundesanwalt.
The letter has the following words after a translation distributed by Strobele:
To the Competents
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic infringements of my government, which led me to a moral obligation to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which is granted to the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged from resonance to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and high officials - including the United States - have considered the disclosures of a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not guilty of any accounting as a service to the public.
These spionage disclosures drew many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits of these knowledge gained for society are increasingly clearer and the risks taken in purchase have been deliberately reduced.
Although the results of my efforts were proven positive, my government still treats this as a violation of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and charge political opinions.
Yet, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will disregard this negative attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been faced, I will be able to participate in the responsible explanation of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, especially in the case of the truth and authenticity of the reports, in a reasonable and legal manner.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.

Child garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "approved" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," stressed Maier.
The budget was 100 000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
It is right to the mayor that Winterlingen has given responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to warm up, look for the garden and clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The music association Hammerijenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
When Dirigent Bianca Willmann lifts the tachstock at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich's musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the songs.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to manage the first musical hockey successfully in this context.
Report: Obama campaign thought to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have in secret considered to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, says the New York Times.
The discovery is the most remarkable surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is a copy of the next book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president's top consultant had carried out "wide group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to determine whether the hope of re-election for Obamas would look better if he let Biden fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly describes the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and of the White House, in particular the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values of exchange of former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest advisors of the president – including Daley, former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and former leading consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thought of change.
The "Double Down" claims that Daley was at the top of the efforts to exchange bids despite their "slow personal relationships", before one finally decided against such a chess train after the data showed that Clinton's candidates would "not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace Biden by Clinton.
“I expressed a number of things to be considered, and that was one of them,” Daley explained to the magazine.
One must remember that the President had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought, “For God’s will, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as "required care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election, there was a considerable effort to determine whether such a train was paying for the elections.
“In campaigns not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something,” explained Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley declared that he does not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious," the former Staff Chief admitted that it was "possibly" that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political dispatches had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking Obama didn't know of the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service have an e-mail similar to the customary post technically implemented the letter secret?
The conception of early Internet services was the forefront of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care of creating a stable foundation for a hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open card rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", then are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna's e-mail client or browser will send the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server will send the content to the provider that Bennni uses.
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software roboters on the road.
At the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail leads to a damage program as an annex.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is a difficult and unwanted spam mail that is deleted at the same time or dissorted in a spam folder at least.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information needed by Google to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can show related links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails with?
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely small.
But theoretically, that is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Criminal authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture or take note of emails.
This includes possible illegal expansion actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With the OpenPGP default encryption, an e-mail can be encrypted against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that not even without anything can be identified who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the main private mailboxes Yahoo and Google, according to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother scarced in the woods and retired
When his old mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to throw their pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after police investigations in the woods.
At first, he disfellowshipped the death of 89-year-olds, then he struck the money for more than six and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Thus the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at that time it was noticed that no medicines were needed for the nursing mother.
The detectives told the retired that his mother was travelling to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It found that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
A obduction, according to the police, did not give evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice – using Quallen.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a bright leakage.
The idea came to him, after he had read a research work on Quallen and Chinese scientists were able to convince him to produce the shining protein artificially.
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue, thus lifting the pH value in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food egg reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you lick, the better it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and the ice lights.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the bulb fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's good for it.
Charlie's experimental company with a seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste directions, including beer, cheese, beef and gold.
However, its latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light breakdown caused by the ice crystals consisting of ice creams; but I suppose we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quarrel produced artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six playdays.
It is now calculated that the team of Ingo Ehlers will come to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who has celebrated his first victory last weekend.
This game starts the season new for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers' behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete frame available.
Daverden also sets on pace games like us.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has left everything else than a safe impression.
Definitely more relaxed, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz will be given after the first seasonal victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to lay down in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Jugendly Joost Windsüß, who is active with double play law at the A-Jung-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal debt.
Whoever's not hot in such a game is supposed to stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweetness, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I'd rather become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I guess I will not do so this year.
But, according to statistics, I'm a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US retailers' association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the 6,9 billion US dollars issued, according to the NRF.
In this year, exciting unexperienced objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes, they can now also organize sedative food such as pizza, Hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-Weltraummen will create it this year into the Instagram Feeds.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year, and it wasn't my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
With regard to sweetness, we are not circumventive.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilos of chocolate gels, luxuries, Bonbons and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Ministry of Trade, says 41 million people who go through the quarters with the word “sweet or acids”.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilos of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't care – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilos of it are sold by Halloween, according to the National Association of Süßwaren Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it spooks.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which are still in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that achieve $500 million sales, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful pictures on which you pinch yourself in the pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you won't lose them again, and then one of the guys on which you stand leaves a comment like "nighter face expression".
But let's finally get to the cubits.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the big cürbis when we were children, and the cutting of a circus lather is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something that we made up from a childhood.
Fortunately, the “Baby in Cürbis” Trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to cut the cürbis right and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $ 106 million for circuits, according to the US Census Bureau.
The circus lats, which are slowly rotting in the front garden, are likely from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilos of circuits have been harvested.
If you want to point correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice from their 921 kilos heavy curbis.
Accommodation fire in Helm Rights: Rescue forces Bergen Colded Body
At the late Thursday evening, the fire force had to go out to Helm Rights.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches in the night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces save a cold body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a cold body in a three-family house in a fire in helmet rights.
Whether it's an inhabitant, it's still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it had burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the fire force arrived, the flames were already beaten out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other inhabitants were not at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
First of all, the building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause for fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has started an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible parish deficiency: The Evangelical-Lutherian Church of Hannover expects that the number of their pastors and pastors will half up to 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burphien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily course itself.
With Burphia, the National Church for the first time instructed a pastor at a full position to enthusiasm young people for theology study.
At present, less and less young people after the abiture decide to study theology.
Burphia is the result of the process of excursion: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and I can put my attention to where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a soul career.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well of them.
Surely more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a safe employer.
This will meet the young people of today who are not only careers, but are going for a senseful work.
According to the National Church, which includes three quarters of Niedersachsen, about 60 pastors are currently retiring a year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thin peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in future.
Burphia wants to organise study days for young people, and also invite prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study offered a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point gurts as well as a free speech facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care for Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistic support up to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventures and a way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format sets out new possibilities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the United Kingdom and abroad and to prepare new ones for the strategies and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge waves – this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firewear for the rescue of a dog, which caught 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock precursor in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in rockbreak in her miserable situation
Firemen sailed off the rock wall and rescued the dog from the safe death
The fire force succeeded in bringing a dog in safety, which was mounted on a 15 meters high predominance in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belonged to the dog, came to the rockbreak Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receipt Ruby and thanks to the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and published help calls in social networks when she ran into the stone break after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the strangled Ruby at the 15 meters high paragraph in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and sailed down to the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then eated a couple of dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said, “Ruby had a huge happiness.”
There was the possibility that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian, but nothing was detected except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Being the salvation was anxious.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion grew too large and it would have crashed, it would probably be crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never offended Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop-star said that she worked as a background singer to Jagger's song "Old Habits The Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old rocker tonight and that “he baked me when I was 18.”
She added, “This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me. ”
In an explanation, a representative of Jagger, 70 on Thursday, said that he “categorically denies that he has ever tried to approach Katy Perry”.
The representative added, "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.

George Kerevan: European deployment gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror history of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the label for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with stachel wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, expectedly, did not play a part in the headers.
Neither has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often rely on their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-observation for Brussels would only be a small concession for what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one who has come so in the years that she already looks like a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” end at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repeating of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pepper?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's association, which has been set up after war, has come to the floor.
The Eurocrisis officially led to the death of Europe's project.
Overall in the EU, parties win on grounds that are enemy to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party was able to set up alternatives for Germany – only this year – for nearly five million votes in the Federal Day elections in September and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been home resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
As a result of the strict saving policy linked to the compulsory jacket in which the national economy is required by maintaining the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the cause of excessive budget deficit by national governments – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has attached its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany.
The only option is to shorten wages and public expenditure, encouraged by Berlin.
A deeper European productivity problem is behind current ethic and monetary problems.
As a result of the “green” energy directives, which are ordained by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the four-fold for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we already saw in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage fixtures do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shirt gas.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, the unique cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elites of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in chess and to lift Paris up to a height of eyes with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gate for political legitimacy and has pushed Europe down its own economic policy, with which the attacked French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pens, legally directed, EU enemy Front National has just won a decisive follow-up and thus led the governmenting socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and that is very good possible – then a such block could first dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the future, the growing resistance against the EU and the common currency will be together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to be distant from this project in the hope of smuggling into the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region shows that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can contradict.
I suppose Scotland would be able to drive well in a looser European association, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider making Norway equal and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP Government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against saving policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and proposed) reductions that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to force Berlin and Brussels to make a saving policy.
Early puberty: Get faster grown up
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age companions, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fatness is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less distinct in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame hair when she is seven or eight years old?
At the annual conference of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not a sign of that the puberty is now coming quickly”, explained Kaplowitz.
Apparent advertisements of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axle hair and body smell, appear in girls earlier.
Yet there was only a slightly shift in the age of Menarche (the occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"If the breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Froe Pubertät bei Mädchen: The Essential Advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most precise test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift before eight years of age.
In most cases the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysters can be excluded.
There are treatments for delaying early menstruation and the defence of other consequences: the early ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicine or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is reluctant about medicines, but he admits: “The oppression of puberty can milden behavior problems and feelings of girls, different from their ages.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygiene side,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causing causes.
Boys come to puberty like girls in the past.
Caplowitz believes that the most convincing premises are the epidemic of fatness.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which creates a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a part.
In this country, Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age companions.
There are different explanations.
Globally, a early puberty of all sorts of things seems to be influenced, from economic conditions over the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow the face and shame hair earlier, the trend to a full-time former puberty is not as outstanding as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shamhaar is widespread even in babies and infants.
“We must be careful how we identify the real beginning of the puberty”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be consulted by their child’s doctor as to how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected”, said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-term flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which airlines are most endeavouring, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest airlines of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded a industry standard this week, which requires a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide this.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft builders are contesting to sell even larger versions of their two-motored long-distance flights and expect record contracts at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the plane is designed – in particular whether there are nine or ten seats – is decisive for the given economic results to provide the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that his modernised “777X” fits 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transportes 350 persons in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giants often share the technical details by advertising in the special press.
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders are expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertising that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and money donors showed a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title "Will you accept that?"
“Boeing suggests long-term flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo props,” says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changes in dietary habits, people become thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Ministry of Health.
The number of male average Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival holds a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized "Jet Set" was smaler.
Airbus has conducted investigations that demonstrated that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus to the seat measurements and says that it is not in the absence of the manufacturers to decide how airlines form the balance between flight tariffs and installations.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful”, explains the air carrier expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes her profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more ellenbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect turnover.
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars according to list prices in the next decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the controversy about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-motor long-range designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results depend partially on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machines currently used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore quets more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products”, says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analytists say that full cabins with ten seats per row of 777 seats suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper flight tariffs.
“Eighteen inches seatwidth would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabins, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world travellers even carry band sizes in order to take care of the establishment at the competition.
Even if they prize comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-depth design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows but has not sold any one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered for some Jets wide seats on the walks.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet, experts say that the reputation of a new industry standard is likely to be suspended, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garue
Scientists have developed a anti-nicotine vaccine that could corrupt the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine disease for a lifetime.
Before testing at humans, further tests will be needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to try all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine desire is stronger than these approaches”, said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant power of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, thus a smoker does not know any nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "outtime", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody sphere that they were expensive and inpractical.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is absolutely sure that children are given before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine abuse.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
“You know, when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to get rid of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi strives to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a detection is initiated by the government corruption oversight.
The former NSW minister struggles to have changed the maritime pact regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden shares in three lands on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations to the question of whether obeily affected various ministers of State to extend contracts to Circular Quay, where the obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without procurement after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi was aware of obeids' hidden interest in the plots, after Tripodis had said the same on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed on public procurement for the pact contracts.
The patriarchs were opposed and wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which submitted the obeids every year, were renewed 2.5 million dollars without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially agreed for public procurement.
However, it is opposed to have made the amendments on requests by Obeid which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed on to transform the government's charter arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone signatures showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, an executive officer who had switched to the port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where was the topic of the development of commercial pacting arrangements in this telephone conversation?" asked the vice Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," answered Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting planes would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday, a leader of the government confirmed Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least two times this year, Israel has already carried out airbatteries on rocket supply in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “reality test”
In the framework of extended measures, the government considers a "reality test" for foreign workers with a visa of 457.
If the test was introduced, it would be used through a criterion that would prevent 457 from being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the increase of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a draft debate was published by the government after the former Members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insult by the neighbours of Australia.
“Large explanations such as ,Americans are supposed to work behind” and “Setting Australians first” are a very unpleasant relapse in times where trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region have an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The debate proposal covers twelve measures that were once proposed by the former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who lived yesterday on talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, which are still being considered.
If the ‘Eightness Criteria’ is accepted, a person applying for a visa may be examined in such a way that ‘the application is true in the cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company’.
Companies could also be obliged to make account of the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers, have finally stopped hundreds of them.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri-Langian asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Great Britain closer together".
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings huge advantages.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “The present announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on to use "unmistakably" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed railway connection provides the potential of huge economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and supplements the link Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government already plans.
I am looking forward to reviewing the survey report with the British Ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian flight passengers must also continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, view or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air mode".
During the most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people feel annoyed that they cannot read their e-books on start and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision for which the US airlines have to carry out massive work, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The Air Safety Authority also explained that the notice would be considered, but underlined that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
‘The CASA has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft’ was stated.
The subject shall be subject to provisions under which airlines maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by cabin staff.
Virgin has already led discussions with the CASA about an extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that you are open to changes, but these should be initiated by the lawyer.
“We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment) during the flight,” said a speaker.
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain up to the other.
“Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at start and landing, and we do not have any plans to change that,” the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will be sure to see the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US-American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
You must prove that their planes can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbaggage programs and customer training.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad view, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during the landing.
The group also recommended that more difficult equipment be placed safely under the seat or in the chairs over the seats at start and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, cooperated BVB trailers had provided with light missiles for terrible scenes in Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football bandesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spenstic acoustic, which offered the viewer up to just before the arrival of the Federal League game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans were with their singings.
On the other hand, the southern tribulation, where the most faithful - and loud - BVB fans stand, first presented itself extraordinarily silent: no songs, no slaughter calls.
The pod of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint inflammation, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the Tribüne, a large flag with the label "Section Stadium Forbidden" was wound alone.
Only as a gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player, entered the place, burned up short-term joy.
When his team colleagues followed, there were loud singing and painful scalls - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern tribulation, there was nothing.
Also that the stage speaker Norbert Dickel once again mentioned the positive experiences of the last days - Derbyg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not ensure celebrations.
Only five minutes before the climb, the Capo climbed its podest - and until then the hand-takable tension was exhausted in a loud scream, when Dickel as usual the mood was questioned on the bars of the stadium.
Lastly, as always, the southern tribe was on the line - and finally was here again as used to the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the noise call "Derbysieger stands up" came from the southern tribe, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light missiles into the viewer bars and fired to the place - and nearly gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was started late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and they believe that Watzke's words were a rather uncomfortable date for fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultramove," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid this," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras has been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, as Watzke says, the BVB will establish a sanction until the end of the next week.
"This will be cutting," insured Watzke.
You may be excited about how the reactions to the southern tribulation then occur.
Pfandhouses are treeing in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a couple of ear rings in the shopping centre of the Bendemeer in Singapore to pay the school fees of their daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about EUR 1,730) each month as a administrative worker and her husband also works, the monthly family income does not fill out, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – is so large that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, this week became the third pfand house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The placing of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhus in Singapore requires an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pfand houses offer the advantage that there is no review of the creditworthiness or income evidence here, so loans are more quickly possible than for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pandhouses after families feel pressure by increasing living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income are looking for pand houses to compensate for the difference in stacking economy.
This week, the Rating Agency called Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, according to the assessment by the Agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, an increase of 60 per cent remaining in 2008.
People's economies are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely escaped from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a remaining export weakness and a delay in consumer demand.
“In the final effect this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malaysic bank.
Historical highest levels in the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend to preserve personal items, since people use the opportunity to transform the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of allocated items are located in the 200 pfand houses of the city state of gold.
People say: "The gold prize looks good, let's plug our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pand house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in his branches in the last few months.
The growth in the pfand business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Ja Lee Ching, the manager of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which took it this week with the stock exchange entry in Singapore.
While some creditors were caught in cruise fire because of high interest rates, Ja explains that pfand houses not only pay more favourable interest than other suppliers but also did not directly increase debts.
"Customs are lending items they already possess, and the liquid personal items do not increase the budgetary education," she explains.
The Pfandleh business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure funding.
Not all people who use pfandlease are also in financial difficulties.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to organize gold bars and Rolex clocks, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
To us customers come from every social layer.
“These includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies who have to break over the cash flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they also just need very fast money.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Discoverer Edward Snowden has a principal interest in helping Germany to inform the increasingly growing NSA peaches.
According to the Green-Bundestag delegate Hans-Christian Strøbele, the surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia focused on the conditions under which ex-security officials would proclaim at a German prosecutorship or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Strobele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health
The Australian government consists of the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health sector in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Mr Tanya Plibersek, Federal Minister for Health, has announced that the Commonwealth will take “indelayable measures” to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has reinforced an emergency rescue package that we believe concerns the unique challenges faced by the Federal State,” said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes $31 million emergency assistance for elections.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, residues should be removed.
In addition, there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better care after stationary stays, medical training, psychological health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas of which I have been told by clinic workers that they are the best way to improve the tasmanic health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister was based on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tazmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-headed Commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only be a little benefit if “it was not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will contribute greatly to taking the state's public health system off the list of concerns,” said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these elections will largely compete for the recent cuts.
However, the health policy speaker of opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a “plaster solution”.
“We are in today’s position because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government almost half a billion dollars out of the system, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million in and then acts like the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the salvation package for additional bureaucracy will be issued.
Guillaume Nicloux' Adaption of the Roman of Denis Diderot convinces with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more difficult than necessary.
The act playing in France in the 1760s tells the dramatic story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic colonel and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never shines out in listeningness or sensational desire – and in it its problem is.
The celebrational seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormental shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its potential for manufacturing chemistry weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important plants for the manufacture of chemistry weapons and gitf gas ammunition, the global monitoring group for chemistry weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country serious collisions occurred near one of the locations where toxic substances are likely to be stored.
Similarly, on Thursday, an Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had already been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date.
1 November, which the Damascus Organisation established in the Hague to destroy all plants for the manufacture of chemistry weapons or to make 'inoperable', including all machinery for the mix of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons until mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria is no longer able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to begin destroying existing weapons and stocks.
According to assumptions there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senap gas and nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday battles took place in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemistry weapons and warehouses here, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights established in the UK reported.
The group of activists who follows the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria explained on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
Of which are 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah military.
Similarly, among the dead there are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but no details.
The fights underline the danger of the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a magnificent civil war.
According to OPCW, who cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team is “never convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
As a result of security concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions had not been possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two locations were “released” according to Syrian statement, and the objects of the chemistry weapon program there had been transferred to other establishments called to be inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat before courage and courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization”, said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the principal Sunitian Muslim Rebells in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and its security forces, many of the Alavitians, a division of Shitian Islam.
In view of further developments, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Observatory, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence system in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Wrath on judgment for Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died at the bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted indignantly to the judgment of the last incentive who was put before the court, since Umar Patek believes that they should be shot stand-rightly.
Patek, who was fleeing nearly ten years as one of the most sought people in South East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building bombing bodies.
He could be released after 15 years of punishment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A debt claim was also made in a series of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia at the Holy Evening of 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it could have claimed death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation, was known as a master bomber.
The decision raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastatation that Patek and his competitors had caused almost ten years ago.
With tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any other grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had an explosive backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for one month after the attack and died three times while he was hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Terror Cell of Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before all others.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds, is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber standing before the court.
He deported nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces almost four months later killed the former al-Qaida Chef Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent stated that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown regret for how much suffering he has added to other people.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers are now able to use electronic devices in planes (but do not have phone calls)
From departure to landing, flight travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and use the view of movies, but not call the phone, according to the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the respective airline, FAA employees Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines shall prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of air carriers and the systems for degrading the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were also among these airlines.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon authorise the extended use of electronic devices,” announced the FAA in an explanatory statement.
Passengers have to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
You must start it again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers will have to turn them off again and do not have to start them again before the plane lands.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the devices even at start, landing and on the wheelfield, the FAA explained.
Most of the new transport aircraft and other flights equipped for the use of Wi-Fi to larger heights should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional airline companion, welcomed the changes.
“If the new scheme is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – then both sides will benefit," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like guardians on this subject.
However, Internet connections remained prohibited for browsing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading of data less than three kilometers, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the flight stair.
And more heavy devices such as laptops must continue to be stabbed, since there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may remove prohibition for certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security experts on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because it could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmissions,” Rosenker says.
A consultative committee of the industry, which was launched by the FAA to examine this topic, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to relieve restrictions on use.
Criticists like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become present.
In some studies, it is mentioned that up to a third of the passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices by flight travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices had been known by passengers' UKW radios, which at that time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the flight height has been reached.
The flights adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only produce minimal radiation when plottering.
However, when downloading or transmitting data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amasone.com is amongst the providers of a releasing of the restrictions on the use of passengers' devices.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the disturbance through the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only a few reports of pilots speaking for disturbing aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices by passengers when the instrument lands under bad visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be fully equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA realizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released bird from the North Sea Bor Island by air rescue service
A bird flying on the coast of flying, which was found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released again into nature.
The water rail was flying with a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was peculiarized by the Scottish Animal Protection Organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water ray was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds across the North Sea.”
Apparently, the tired bird was seeking refuge on the drill island.
He added: “He could not continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When they released, the water wheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's Elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide for prosperity and work in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have given the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 economic leaders, representing approximately British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found out that the major majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the EU states stagnate.
They wish that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil should be favoured by governments instead of stopping with the long and effortful process of reforming the obscured EU institutions.
In their opinion, the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be recovered to Westminster, from cartel law to product legislation.
It was generally dissatisfied with the internal market, since, according to the statements of companies, the costs of Brussels regulations would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the most traditional European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most said, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards the change of the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy pushes to a “sensitive change” that brings the penalty of action back to the UK.
It is a matter of much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change in opinion in favour of the remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the re-examination of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a re-newal of a significant shift in power relations back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fisheries union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows what a stronger focus for companies on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' approach to regulations is.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gasary
The start of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
“The present event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has started," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides an increased risk for conventional routes, as is heard from official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'forever' disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favour prices when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no road goes by the real estate site in Germany.
The economic framework data are sound, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic framework in the country in Europe compared.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange show.
According to the search for German commercial property, the view of the transaction volume shows, Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Investments offer an attractive interest," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual offences in relation to children before 2011 charges were raised against the child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission learned about sexual abuse by children.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA stated that “in the organization it has never been involved with an incident of sexual child abuse”.
Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA member had been accused of child pornography offence, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been condemned for the abuse of confided children.
Hare said to Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assisting lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been uncertain in the assertion that ‘there have been external audits of the YMCA where the YMCA was recognised as the front front in child safety’.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible at a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management has failed "from me downwards" in the setting up of Lord and has not ensured that employees were clear about their obligations to report infringements of the directives on child safety.
Lord had been sentenced for sex offence to twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare, however, argues that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed offences, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she cared privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his shot, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose manager was Lord and had asked for training for child protection because she was worried about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was in YMCA Caringbah, was “very frightening and most of the time very neglectable”.
The management officer stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted to reimburse their supervisory notification.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord has affected her judgmental ability, why they would not have reported to him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson to withdraw the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord's intermediary" concerns "not reporting" by employees, and the Board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to push the staff to sign secretary obligations was taken by the manager of the YMCA's children's services, Liam Whitley, shortly after the accusations were made.
He said that there should be no contamination of the evidence, but that was “excessive” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children in the period between 2009 and 2011 when Jonathan Lord was employed, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, explained the Commission.
He explained that there have been "reasonable problems" in setting up, auditing, working, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was deprecated by 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening at the fifth anniversary of his excretion from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has widely avoided expressing himself on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as the Messenger of the Middle East Peace Foundation.
On the question whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, surely, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in Skaren in Cardiff to cruise the horse of the year, they realized that a hard competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and did only a few months ago his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee took easy through the three rounds and picked up the first price – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and styles in the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate mould in a frightened angle and led the two-year-old taffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which was far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift last March for his third birthday and has been practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and taffee are a great tension.”
They had to enter the entire participant field and have gone off the place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with taffee, and we were all enthusiasm when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been presenting horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electricalized and everyone fired it and clothed it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he starts, it will not take long until he is on the "perd of the year" shoe – and I am sure he will cut well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together, they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they had beaten and presented in the presentation.
They take care of good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there Fenton and Taffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed to its part, that really fits perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed” after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested release of a reporter charged for diffaming, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The new Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for release by the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Yet Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribe money to fake reports about a state company.
The new expression is now undergoing a ‘developing rectification’, explained the regulatory authority.
The “regulatory arrangement” was received by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Movies and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the new Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inappropriate reports on the börsennotated company Zoomlion.
“The redaction management of the New Express was unordered,” announced the regulatory authority in an explanation.
She said that it was decided to impose a administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporting licence.
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the new Express and recommends that the relevant operators of the New Express be detected and immediately checked the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported claimed financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in State TV and admitted that he published false reports against payment.
“In this case I harmed Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain confidence in the public”, he explained to the State News Sender CCTV.
I did it first because I was looking for money and glory.
I realized that I was wrong.
After Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the cover page and declared that it was neglected to correctly check the reports.
Several known suspects have made confessions on television in recent times.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with own rail between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 cm measuring tunnel as one of the most defective passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields in the Zickzack pattern, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless insignificant warehouses that make it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drug was unrecognized, the authorities explained.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men, according to the state of the authorities as drivers, were accused of marijuana and cocaine's possession and intended sales.
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set on an extensive underground network of degradation channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails that passed from a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Schauspieler Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Schauspieler Orlando Bloom has spoken for separation from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was to be issued on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "this life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he loved themselves still, the 36-year-old underlined.
"We will support and love each other as the parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is, according to Lexika, distinguished by vegetarism, but is very different from that in a significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetorts, ice or a powerful Edamer, these muds do not stand on the food card of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the veganer leaves from all the food of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, may one ask, but when considering it, the veganeous nutrition world is characterized by a considerable scope of influencing.
"Broth strikes are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the present reform house, which provides a variety of special products for veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the born New Zealand countries have lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (fastly) everything he needs to live. "I killed my diet in 1997 and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choosing," says Proctor, who prefers normal leather.
He realized that there are also other daily concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is a ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of veganers that extends to the whole consumer behaviour.
Instead of restraining citizens, robbers or rubbers, the veganer quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan does not represent its absence, no axes, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that the nutrition conversion reduces the selection of food options, Proctor is rather a result of the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also let some of the attempts that were so well meant fail.
"The drug factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to when smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And say, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the veganers.
For example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons and also a few vegan brushs to a barbecue.
He looks at a balanced, varied diet, where it is supposed to taste deeply.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, that is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
He has not suffered health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes who feed solely vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'm often being checked," Proctor tells.
In particular, many vegan simus critics are warning against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are feeded with feed instead of grassing on the grass, it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin B12 is high in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator," says Proctor.
For veganers there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Proctor must not go far away for food purchases.
Finally, there are basic nutrients everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
All I need is on the place.
Just sometimes I buy something special.
"Many people ignore that only the finished products are expensive, but so is known for "usual" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan courts was much more favourable and less timely than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small knifes you can be good if not partially achieve better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more back powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor was able to make his mother-in-law amazement.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new spice.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new job value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has already been confronted with him.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as a veganer with fingerspitting feelings.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor does not want to tempt enclavendase.
And more precisely, the everyday world then does not appear as veganal as suspected - and the veganer is not as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he turns out on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of the habit.
The restaurants are so slowly working on it.
"When I started to feed me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people to make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the compound in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan court on the food card.
In fact, vegan dishes are there for all.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Felish dishes are exclusive, in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the most part of the past impossible," says Proctor.
But the shopping of vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning.
Especially when you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives in earthnuts as a color donor, you seem to leave courage quickly with the follow-up of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients, which are added to food but also to cleaning.
"After and afterwards you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to stumble," white Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps he does not make it possible for one to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to hold his customers in breath.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US optional markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger bands with the stock exchange operator.
Not until Tuesday, the indexes of Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively malfunctioning purchases to the options markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and strike the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole share trade in the United States was held for several hours because of a computer pane on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
Further, in the last year, the stock exchange was made available from Facebook.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales contracts, later established the stock exchange supervision SEC and dunned the company to a record punishment of $10 million.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-olds around
The accident had occurred, according to the police, when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at 22:00 a.m., was on the left road from the station to the market station with a lady bike.
As a 63 - year - old man suddenly walked from a place on the road, the bike driver, according to the police, could no longer bremse in time.
During the next collision, the footer was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in a further course, and increased a 15 cm long place wound on the head.
A rescue cart team brought the injured to the physician treatment to the clinic.
British Police is sending Assange a delivery notice
The British police today sent a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who seeked refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had a “invitation to stand” that invited him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not follow it, threatening arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the accusation in a sexual offence, after his possibilities have been exhausted by British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected his objection against the delivery at the beginning of the month.
He feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, and on 19 June he had seeked refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “advised a 40-year-old man to stand at a police guard at a time chosen by us,” explained one speaker.
He continues to infringe the conditions of his release of deposit.
The message did not comment on the presentation of the police call.
Assange fears that it was delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spying claims after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks' discovery site.
Chauffeur who had been made with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs receives 1,000 £ punishment
A car driver was charged with a punishment of £1,000 because he was driven with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester Court, Howie confessed himself guilty without having taken care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month drive ban.
Howie was also condemned for the payment of costs of £90 and a sacrifice of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of tax Chancellor George Osborne, who in the budget of 2012 charged a stempel tax of 7% on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Even now, the revenues from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, amounted to the profits for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the stempel tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against a circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the older Community tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more restraint in the purchasing of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class property – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has experiencing a record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market, where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a rise, according to a study of Savills.
Scientists could throw more light on the context in which a dog’s tail wheat is with his mood.
Former research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more toward the right (from the sight of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In people it is well known that the left and right brain half of the brain is different to stimulli, which causes positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and reversed, and that the two hemisphere played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about the reaction of dogs to the sides of their species, researchers monitored the animals while viewing these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the cock moves into one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, so that we could control the movement of the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw how a other expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the weaving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, if the tails were mainly leftwards (always from the perspective of the dog who waves), their heart rate increased and they looked unreassured.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different contests with other dogs and you have to wedge with your tail in a direction that is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the knowledge could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and hospitality at the University of Bristol Faculty of Animal Medicine, explained that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their head left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following stated: “Dogs go to a robot dog more when their “chanz” wears left and not right, instead of becoming disturbed – exactly different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not make an exception there," says Bradshaw.
But since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves into one, sometimes into the other direction.

Pope Franziskus appointed the first cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Franziskus was first called for new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that French will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope election – that is a group of 120 "valuable cardinals".
In an explanation in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as consistoria.
“Papest Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to call the Consistatory in advance in February, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals would probably have decreased until February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of elected cardinals will be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory in next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain crossing on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first ones called since the creation of the Council of Cardinals founded by French, to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the order to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He declared that it is 'good possible' that French ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Franziskus is “full of surprises – so we don't know who he is appointing”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the United States to repair the seat leans
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat leasing, so a communication from the U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for redistributing the front seat leans.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety in Head Supports.
“When driving from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not protect the inmates properly so that there is an increased injury risk”, the message was read at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models returned were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and represents the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative effect on car sales in October.
The sale of silverado and Sierra trucks, which were re-developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20 per cent during the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup Trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Depression crying of a Obama chooser
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible.
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been contaminated by the blockadectics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare, the drones attacks
Obama's memories about the 2008 election campaign would be a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It is a book of which I believed it would rejoice me during the disgusting second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It says "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient signatures in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could rub the breath.
The choice was held as a peasant and news speaker in order to highlight the historical importance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama then switched to the office in 2008, he had 82% consent values.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back to present is a bad awakening, as if you were ripped out of a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vain memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years, since I gave my vote for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of the forced absence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that participatory blockadectics has broken too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name only a few.
However, after countless defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I came to the end with my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political depression.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to interrupt foreign heads or to kill innocent children by drones in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished to reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. national, was murdered without procedural procedures, and why the public financing and output limits were ignored during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which says that the White House's efforts to reassure the media are the "agressivest ... since the Nixon Government".
And in recent times it cannot apologize the inability to design a simple website in over three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
It is evident that the Member's name is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacher represent the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
In the midst of Romney, he represented a confusing and unearned alternative, he seemed not to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard so long.
However, with the reduction of the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book.
I have a longing for the many promises that have resolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to place a severe loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree stronger to you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental vacation
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental vacation because his daughters became pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a judicial controversy on the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to clean questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters would benefit from Abbott personally from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission of Palmer officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast Seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance.
Palmer asked for a revision of the process to count the vote so that it could move faster.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we have no system where you enter data into a computer, immediately choose and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in the marking of the voting list.
Do you use it because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today, it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that a international airport for the Sunshine Coast belongs to his policy and that he will take his new office “very seriously”.
A public office is involved in public service.
“We are seeking no reward except for history, that we can serve in a critical time of this Community,” he said.
RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official detection of the presumable manipulations of the monetary market is rapidly driving.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which 5,3 billion US dollars change the owner daily.
The two merchants would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation, which draws the scandal around the Libor Interbank Business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month the situation related persons stated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been allowed from his current position as European leader of the Forex-Spot trade at JPM Organ.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was advocated this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading monetary dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these dealers was accused of any misconduct.
The instant message group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation nearby people.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that she investigated a suspected manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently complaining that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPM Organ and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people with the situation.
Banks come through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misbehavior.
The news about these investigations has put dealers in an area of upheaval, which in recent years has been one of the most profitable of the trade units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-grade liquid exchange market, but leading dealers are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trade platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “a very low ticket prices” influence on the market.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds Office this week after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank informed the competent authorities immediately and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is restricted,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle groundpiece
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has splendid the building tone on the Bechtle ground at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and distributed the footway, it says in a press release.
For safety reasons, the planned coverage of the crushing house in the rear part of the property was not allowed because the site is threatening to distort.
Alfred Abel, who currently managed the property, had agreed the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a translucent with the message "We have been able to do so" had been placed.
However, this little disturbed the 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was called "We are against construction ruins".
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss grass - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passengers in front of the "building site" it was clear that some citizens believe that the achievement of the city project will be much better, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, it says on the side of the BI.
As I heard, the public statements of the mayor also have an effect.
In May, at the municipality meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex in the Swiss way in the decision.
Some are therefore just scared, others feel that they are "plumps of extortion" in the population, says the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schilde for Schiris: Mane no sulphur king
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga-Tabelleführer Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is a dangerous tendency now that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of sulphur kings," he protected the two offensive wirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for ranknicks criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a supposed act of crush - which was clearly none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crack of failure," said Ranknick, who called Harkam arbitrator, "tolerated".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German landsman decidated: "I would have acted as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarmskytter with Hüter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success, however, Ranknick agreed to a lobshymne.
"For that there are only two words: Right good," he noted.
There's not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
I want you to keep doing this.
Frame changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Apart from a player, he wants to leave the association," ranknick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the government of Obama: The US Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US-American citizens to complete a health insurance by 2014 or to pay a punishment – is constitutional in the context of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also expressed the view that the provision of the health law, which states should either extend the access requirements for medicine or otherwise eliminate all state aids, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The proceedings against the law had been enforced by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 Electoral Battle.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low sunrise, the Rjukan located in the Westfjord Valley usually declines in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Definitely!", sweared Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start-up ceremony in TV2.
Some valley inhabitants retreated sun chairs, others set up sunglasses for safety.
Until then, sunshined ones had to drive with a rope to a close summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to lead the radius with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in the village since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (circa 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar design has been provided for a few years with winter sunlight to the Italian Alpen City Viganella.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday learning are still on different card boxes of the city and the parts of the city, but if you read the small printed one on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sunday and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building in the Ernst Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller Street 1 are taught in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it is cleared in Hofheim and Rosengarten even on Sunday, the answer to the FDP's question is not answered.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday clearance is an important post service at the appointment post.
"This dims this business despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 radically and indispensable."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberal Group and the Citizen of the City, supports his group colleagues: "What makes me anxious is the fact that the time of emptying is changed or also deleted here in secret."
From citizens close to the post is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Newslott and Rosegarten must be cleared again on Sunday," said Bittner and Pipe Beck unisono.
Also valid for the nuclear city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday learning as well.
Rohrenbeck in the city parliament asked whether the city administration plans conversations with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge is also a Sunday lecture in Hofheim.
Their party has spoken for privatisation.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt's parking fees are intended to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensitively expensive.
The Magistrate of the city advises this morning about a presentation of transport deputy Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not to increase prices for this purpose, but to reduce the period of parking hours and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the City Regulatory Assembly will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers that it is "no good idea".
The parking possibility right before the business is "a non-necessary advantage for smaller traders".
The transport club in Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonably adequate and actually overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Joy Town: Fast Actions Overwhelmed Hosts
With a narrow frame, the Gentlemen I of the TSV were required to enter the Schiller school hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwabische Alb.
The Elblers stood on the other side with an experienced team.
But soon it became evident that they, including age-related, could not fully comply with the fast actions of the joyous cities.
With the hard and placed looks, the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly over the network center and were not in place at the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all interests.
In view of this impressive and play-determining performance, the third sentence was then a little lazy and luxury at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which could clearly go through in Nagold, a significantly stronger opponent will be on the field.
TSV Glädnstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the other teams of manyrsbronn and a joyous city were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-conflicted two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused, especially in the ball assumption, errors and score gifts; even with the passports, the precision was sometimes lack of software and in some critical stages the overelev prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this powerfully balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team has been able to make the great physical use and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
At the present fifth day of care in the success of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to the suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view should be cut free to the valley, said mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so the Emperor, called this area the glory of the climb, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for glorious views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of human and nature.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration could also be found.
This environmental aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen rule and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide-ranging view covers the goal of maintaining the strongly grown old alimentary field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterfly and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss a lanser for the planned biosphere area.
This plan does not include the current measure only in a naked manner.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplement to the life project and the previous care days achieved for the future.
Following these different presentations, the head of the department, Christoph Wehle, and the project manager of life, Cornelia Bischoff, shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in front, the forest scraper would be ready to pick up.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of the Wacholder tubes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The objective was the freedom of view at the viewpoint.
Opening: Buyer still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarststadt Löffeningen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, children, youth and senior politics, as well as its own city works, has not yet been reported as an attractive city.
As the only candidate for the follow-up of the Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer candidate for age, has been established by the 46-year-old bank buyer and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffeningen.
The deadline for application will end on Monday 11 November at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei declared for Nortel patches
The group of thousands of former Nortel patches stricted on Thursday a lawine of complaints for patent injury against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was offered by him at the insolvency increase of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for 2.5 billion US dollars, declared Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent injuries before the Texas District Court.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is prosecuted in seven cases of patent injury.
The patent relates to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make mobile phones working with Google's operating system Android, which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued a initial order of over $900 million for the Nortel patches.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel patches were bought by Rockstar, Google Motorola acquired mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was also motivated to patents as part of Motorola's library.
“While Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has injured the patent and continues to do so,” says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high injury replacement by Google, as it claims that Google's patent injury is deliberately, so the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi departs the office, but his day of triumph does not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus came to the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been exposed 16 months earlier from the office.
Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth Head of State since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 black robes dressed judges of the court, who have his seat on the Nile and have been found for an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the celebration ceremony, which was transferred live in the state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group who had been mostly taken into vision since its foundation 84 years ago as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 o'clock.
Only a few hundred attendants had gathered before the court to rejoice to the new president, and, in contrast to the presidial prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was only suspended in a short time so that the autoconvoi could cross the busy road that the city centre is connected to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since its victory and a Friday talk, not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but as all of those who wanted to bring to the goal of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” explained Mursi in a blue suit dressed with red clothing to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he put off the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his attendance talk.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel that played the national hymn, which he listened to in his possession.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants at the university's largest hearing hall with speaking hearing by "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a high-burg of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on the Tahir spot, the birthplace of the rebellion that led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks, and he promised to call back presidial powers that the Military Council had taken over by the Head of State chaired from the Office.
However, by delaying the official oath before the court and not as usual before the Parliament, he abstains from the military's will, which indicates that the force fight will continue.
Mursis talk on the Tahir spot was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has started.
On today's Friday evening, it's called "Pump this party", in the morning Saturday evening, it's going on with a Ü 25 party.
Of course, fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organisers in both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell down by a ladder and hurts himself.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outer phase of a guest house.
When he climbed on the ladder connected to the roof, he ran away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to the Salzburg National Hospital with the rescue hub screw "Christophorus 6".
Violent in South Africa: twice life in prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the transgressor was sentenced to two lifetimes on Friday.
This was reported by the Sender SABC.
The victim had later died from the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had caused disturbance across the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The view of young people was so disgusting that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in the night with Booysen.
He also admitted to beaten and rape, but he argues to be responsible for the girl's death.
At first, the police had been exposed to several complaints, but two suspects released the prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also underlined during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa: every year there are about 64,000 advertisements for sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers of sexual violence to the 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest shinking
Jumbo looking for the "best shinking in the world": The Pro7-Star Bonndorf was visited for the television broadcast "Galileo".
The speaker clarifies at the beginning: The most important thing for the shinking is the pigs, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can shinks you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large schinken factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"German dear shinks," as Jumbo announces the black forest shinks.
Only with hair-protection and Kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening fast imbiss in forest shut
"Here I will work awesome amounts," the TV Macher, black forest shinking as a mass product.
16.000 colds per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat proportion, color: Uli explains what it is about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details like the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what's happening," said Jumbo Cynic.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The viewer sees that the degradation of the keels continues to be handwork.
Because: Black forest shinking is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of shinking is the mixture of spices with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking fire Jumbo recalls an "U-Boot".
The trick: Tand branches here in the smoke provide the special taste of the black forest shinking.
20 days in smoking eventually make the shink almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test food.
"It's really delicious," says the facility of the TV star.
This will enable all the stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from vacants in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now pays from a cleaned annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the 2011/12.
According to Graham Turner, in the first half of the year Flight Centre gained eight percent and booked a strong start in the second half, especially in Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are in good way towards record year income before interests and taxes,” he explained.
This includes Australia and Britain, typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which compensates for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it worked well for the recreational business of Flight Centre in the UK, while the business customers also spend less here.
The US business recovered from the seasonal weaker first half year, so that a profit is expected for the third year in a sequence for the whole year.
The shares of the Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are held to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
In the examination, “unseen texts” are also found in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is eliminated.
From 2015, students have to submit an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualifications.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new educational plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first factors that have been radically transformed.
Other nuclear plants will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a new organisation of GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less course work.
In a talk in summer, Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "coming more challenging, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, but from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive mathematics test – combined with a stronger weighting of the rank list – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
In the educational plan, more attention is paid to ‘problems of the right life’, including financial mathematics.
Locate Beautiful Animals and Delicious Torts
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors present the circuit performance view this weekend at the citizenship.
The reviews were already carried out on Thursday
Again, the local association W514 delivers this great exhibition.
Culturers of the associations in the circle of Soest here show their best animals as well as young Wickeder Hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges took the evaluation of numerous rabbits and were able to identify outstanding animals.
Visitors of the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 14.30 p.m.
The rabbit view is open for all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 to 15.30 a.m., which joins the victory.
The guests are also invited to a flat-suited Tombola and to a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenic Conversation Forum
The next forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, is the theme "To hell with hell - theological thoughts about today's dealing with the last things".
Reference is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecoumenic Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church municipalities of Salem, the Palace of Salem and the Culture Office of the Soil Sea.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question in the forum how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries have known too much about it and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "who make our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic teaching is more evident of the hopes of completement by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by Christian women and Christians by religious critics," says the referendum.
She "supplied us with so many questionnaires that the proclamation marks seemed to be off our way."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the trouble of death."
This is related to the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything may be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promoted Dr. Theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecoumenic Theology followed by the Westfalian University of Wilhelm in 2003.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geilings: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their confession of faith in the company
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds have been confirmed by the seal care unit At Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning, the church was accompanied by the Laurdag-Si group, the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.
With the receipt of the company, the youths said yes to their baptism and invited the power of the Holy Spirit.
The companies had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of many members of the community for the great festival.
In various projects, they learned various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In a wonderful weather, 214 bicyclers came to Illmensee to handle the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel is announced by the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 hill meters, were numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in the race-fat mood.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German masterships.
Both of them were expected to resign from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time forward to the goal and defend his title as a total victory of short distance.
On the second place, Pascal was able to relocate Treubel.
With the ladies, Theresa Duelli was from the team's nightmare, which made it at the top of the victory trap.
Anne Adel came to place two and three from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owingen.
A delightful development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only with regard to performance, the entire bandwidth of athletes was represented.
The age structure also reached from ten years to over 70 years with the oldest launchers.
In the main race this year, more absolute topatlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to resign from the regional high-speed drivers.
These include Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professor from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was two times world champion in the twelve-hour walks with a team colleague.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of height, there was a flashing finish in the target entrance in front of the three-sea hole.
Pangerl was the first to rush over the target line.
Only a second after that, the routine ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place secured Areane Blersch from Binwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George's Bwelle watched his sick father lose his consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused a hematome that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neuro surgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompaniing his father in overfilled hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first, and isn't the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a physician for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered, in Bwelle, made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, traveling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he forces up to 30 people into small buses and drives with the worn medical equipment on the roof over unfitted terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a feast, singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its broad smiles and its boundless energy – is happy to attend the celebration.
The next morning the team then starts with the study of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride”, says Bwelle.
They come from a 60 kilometres round the village – and it is walking.
Each of these weekend hospitals offers medical care in a variety of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmittable diseases.
Others receive crows, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local deafness.
The operations usually take place in a school, a house or a apartment; after the intervention the patients rise up and go to the restoration area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the group's generator and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until early morning in Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will then return to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free surgery of a performance break he received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics at Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his publicly useful activity, such as Bwelle; the remainder comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studys and voluntarily cooperates in Bwelle's group at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
He's always in the hospital or trying to spend money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we can help cut off blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their travel to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitary material.
But if they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people know no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
To help others to make a more happy life and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the struggle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hase in his metre, the acting art.
The old man Santiago doesn't have any idea of fishing.
That's how the two just complement themselves greatly.
They almost mean to see the folds in the neck of the old man who the fisher boy Manolo is talking about.
When Santiago is tired of life on the chair, it's true with Janson.
Besides, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and his will strength.
Janson is in long distances as an entrant on the stage.
He is able to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologue is not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue-lighted bottles of water.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the Fischerdorf.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, singing the life emotion of Cuba with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Declining to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a waste water channel from the Roman time is obtained below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne doesn't come by the Dom.
The two towers rise to heaven about 157 meters and make it the second largest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrane church towers, know that there is a lot to discover under the dom.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne subworld matters.
Meeting point for his guides is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Dom.
The circuit starts unspectacularly: "We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the fathers of the city wanted to have an auto-reparated city, so the remains of the old walls remained just that which was not too large.
Therefore, most of the users of the parking house also travel through the Roman remnants today and only put their car off.
But who looks closer, discovers in the Park Deck D2 an archaeological foundation separated by metal stairs.
There are some five meters of ruins of handcall sizes of stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, schools leave the participants on the upper parking level to throw a look into a dark 15 meter deep box.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
The next station of the circuit is the pretoria, and here the participants go back down to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as "the city of the Roman Law and the city of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for Emperor culture".
And the Pretoria is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the premise of the exhibition, tunnel access leads to the Roman waste water channel, which has been obtained here at about 120 meters of length.
"You can slowly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," school says the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After picking up the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, walkable box.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washing.
Until today, at the bottom of the Michwe, whose origins decline up to the eighth century, different water levels can be found through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Michwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the cottage place for which the construction work will soon begin.
But until completion, a few years will pass.
Almost cracked legs: Release of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous body injury and injury against two 30-year-olds has started before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are quiet to the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The public prosecutor proposes them to have put and hit three men in a car together with unknown competitors in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have belonged to the competing group of Hells Angels.
One was supposed to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
Previously, it seems that a number of cars had been hunted.
According to the prosecution, it was about counterfeiting and a force demonstration.
The two prosecutors had been released in a first procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker said then that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody fever.
The transgressors had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof revoked the ruling after the audit of the prosecution and referred it back to the ruling court for the re-examination.
One of the accuseds is currently in open enforcement because of another crime.
The reconstruction of the courses in the evening was particularly the start.
As a witness, the investigating Commissioner was loaded.
In the center of the police, there were telephone talks of the prosecutors and other persons who had listened to the police.
It's hard that Rocker's almost always adhering to a law for her, and not proclaiming.
This is also true of the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed out.
State prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the State Prosecutor Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that there were new traces since the last procedure.
There are 11 further negotiations for the process.
The disposal company doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it went home.
Only: In the books of the people on the accompanyer and backseat, hunger becomes noteworthy.
Sure, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What is closer to riding to the next drive-in to get a little?
I admit, I'm glad to join you when it's going to fast-food hole at late night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a citizen - and then nothing like going home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangers are noteworthy.
Because what must be missing that you throw your fast-food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, wasted paper bags are located on road edges and on parking sites.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home and to the next trash?
It's not just the case that the paper tools are distorting the landscape.
Tubes have also covered transport facilities such as guide boards and thus caused accidents.
On such a thing, "removed society" does not think, she probably doesn't even know what this word really means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look for feasted nights: clothes, bottles, and other garbage are towering.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - in contrast to the road, where no one wants to walk around on the food remains of others.
I see the day when the cities and municipalities are getting too stupid - and the fast-food chains have to demand pfand for their bites.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After severe criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal to his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of insurers received an announcement from their insurer, the Republicans sent to the President in the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
“The majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look after a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could receive such a better, comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than forecast.
"You're coming a better offer," he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who had concluded insurance itself had to look after another tariff, as their contract does not comply with the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say to these Americans that you deserved better,” said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This exclamation of a deprived Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at the yesterday hearing at the representative house was taken up after a controversy with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be engaged in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily reject a state-funded insurance in order to complete itself a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Point
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news transmitter CNN that Israeli fighting aircraft had attacked an air weapons base in Syrian Latakia one day before.
The objective was "rakets and related equipment" of which the Israeli government feared they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base point in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis was responsible for that.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport caps up to 70 kilos.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Defence Ministry said, "We do not comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground air missiles to Hisbollah earlier, partly successful.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented confession that the U.S. spionage has gone too far.
John Kerry, with an unexpected confession, stated that the US's defence position in its monitoring programmes was “to-existed” in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for turning to "autopilot" when the explosive disclosures of Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA's spying activities.
The information that the U.S. Government has been given through has brought to a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the sides of its allies.
Kerry said at a speech transmitted by a video connection at the Open Government Conference in London: “The President and I and others in the government have experienced some things that have expired quasi by autopilot simply because the ability to do what was still on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, on 11 September.”
He then admitted, as a first high-level member of the US Government, that the U.S. spionage has exceeded a border, but also stressed that no rights were abused.
He said, "In some cases this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of goodness and that many lives were saved by their surveillance operations.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is conscious of killing people, exploding into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in front of them.
In the meantime, US legislators will travel to Europe to disperse the concerns against the claimed American spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is for the first time a democracy in the Senate and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have charged the relations with some US alliances, although the head of the Secret Service this week declared that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures were quoted from documents published by Snowden that the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spying in allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the convention that will take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route was still to be developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "severest words".
He said that the European governments must be honest to their people about the kind of spying programmes they have used for years.
"We can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans' rights, but they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only spions," says Murphy.
In the meantime, John Kerry has a trip to the Middle East and to Poland in the weekend to deal with the wrath of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
A tough injury at the spring gelenk threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the Federalliga outdoor game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is looking for a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the crew.
So far he could only individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his six hits with the best gatekeepers.
Because the Mainzers have already to abstain from the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian complains against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was convicted in Phuket to 15 days in prison because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has objected to the judgment of appeal and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a province court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had indicated to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she was sure to get to her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed that she had found out the story.
Until the trial, she was in police warranty on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a prison with a low level of safety at the edge of Phukets, instead of in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy Liga, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course, we're worried about it, but we hope she's back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is making holidays in the town of Krabi in South Thailand.
On the side of the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith's travel buyer, could have tried to improve his attacked tourist image in Phuket, and it is therefore a free speech.
