Biden conducts examinations in three key regions
When there are only 100 days of elections, Joe Biden, an offering democrat, takes the lead in three important flipping rims.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured by 51% in response to 46% in accordance with the President.
In Arizona, the status is 49% – 45% Biden is in the wild and Michigan is in the superior victory of Biden, leading with 12 points, 52% – 40%.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these countries to us, and, in fact, more.
Trump sits up in these days with a crown virus age that nationals teach him increasingly, and tells the majority of the questions of the world have responded badly, or very bad at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has disregarded protests and disturbances that broke up at George Floyd’s death.
Trump and his government seem to have reacted badly or wrongly.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism because of ordering federal police to break back protests in cities where city or government leaders are Democrats.
It has created a tremendous wolf among the city’s inhabitants, and that anger is contaminated to other Americans.
Pictures of federal police to climb Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States.
The Lincoln Project was an advertising, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three countries in 2016, but with a very small difference.
In fact, Trump victoryed many countries with little votes, and won the elections with a minority of votes.
For example, Michigan won only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% inhabitants.
Almost all political reports say that the same conclusion is to be made by Biden.
A new study of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s headline is now drawn up from the limits of the scan.
The same is the case with the CNN and the Quinnipiac University of Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who puts well to the right and declared support to Trump 2016, has published investigations of the same substance in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the questionnaires, is that Trump could be hoped to return to important places within the country where the elections are focused on the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 epidemic, but choosers do not seem to link the economic attack to the chronic virus age.
In fact, the majority of the choosers seem to teach Trump that they have reacted badly to the chronic virus age, but they better trust him in the economic accident that is in the state at this time.
However, Trump has failed to run the discussion in the election campaign.
Following the struggles that have almost continuously burned from the news, the video produced terriblely, where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to control the discussion of law and its importance.
Law and Order, became his characteristic words.
It seems now to have failed completely, as said earlier.
As the survey increases in Trump, more and more republics are likely to divorce Trump and describe support for various Bidens, or someone else, which is then Biden without mentioning it specifically by name.
This is because of the arrangement in the United States that they choose in many elections on the same license.
In this way, the choosing can simply mark the second class of the predecessor part of the electoral note, and make it valid as a vote for all the other suppliers of its class on the vote note.
Thus, the Promotors of the Republican Group in other officials try to quit Trump’s team and achieve independent success in the elections.
The Olympics of Youth in Dakar Deferred to 2026
Adolescences were to take place in Dakar the next year, which has now been deferred to 2026 because of the chronic virus age after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed on it.
However, the delay of the first Olympics to take place in Africa is a struggle for many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested because of the burn in Nantes
A volunteer in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fire that destroyed the church.
According to a prosecutor, Le Monde advocate, that the suspected refugee from Rwanda, who served as a church overseer, acknowledged the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, says that the man is a great man for his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire, a 17th - century bird and historically pictured windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the 18th of July, but was released from prison.
He was then returned to a reporting work yesterday, and then he was held in a guardian afterward.
"No one went out of this"
I am welcomed in Baltasar’s and Christian Samper’s home in Copenhagen.
My visit is a new musical show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1, in the Load of Little-Kambi on the Snowfield.
This is the first time the fathers show together.
I am led down to Baltasar’s laboratory, where a great painting looks at me.
Large and drunken pictures of birds in the past but also of flying creatures; an eagle on one, shadows of birds on another.
The workshop is formed in the garden of the home.
"We had a horse here with us who weed the grass," says Baltasar to me.
"The Horse works much better than a sleeve on these caves and floors we have."
Mireya is with us, Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works do the work that is here.
“Institutes, mixtures of paperworks and decorative sculptures.
They're all very white and in contrast with what Dad is doing, because I'm working with the light and so,' she says.
“ It’s a year since that idea came up.
At that time, I was working for certain jobs and wanted to show them there, but they were attached to Tokyo by Covid.
When my dad started painting and I saw where he was going, I thought about my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong baptism in English national stories about female bastards and waters.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the boys, I felt the ideal to make a decoration related to them, ” says Mireya, but she works with the victory of No Bear Son of Gold in the Sign store.
"Then I do the installation from the decor."
In the last year Mireya’s exhibition of 72 artists of the Academy of the Snefellsnesi, including in the Little - Kambi sheet, found the building fantastic.
“ This is a new space, an old load that has just been made up, ” says Mireya, who talked there to Baldvie, the Sverris daughter of an artist, who suggested Mireya and Baltasar set up a show together.
“ She wanted us to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
That's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and attended the University of List in Barcelona before he was on a world trip to study art collections and research.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961, and he was thrilled by land and nation.
He came back here shortly later, met his wife, Christian, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is an excellent artist, has held a lot of private shows, and shows with the Christian world.
He is the most known for his large wallpapers, named a wall decoration in the Flethean Church and a fresco in the Vice - Orte Church.
“ What affects what I do is bitter that Iceland has and nowhere else, ” says Baltasar.
“ These low sunshine and those shadows that are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, "Wow, here you can work."
Mireya is the eldest of the children of Kristjöna and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“ There was something I knew, it was quite clear, that I was not going to become a musician, ” she asked if she wanted to follow her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to a mathematics and science course at school and did everything I could to get rid of this.
Then I realized I was on a refuge.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
She has, like her father, shown around the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All Baltasar’s and Christian’s children have made the way of art.
“ I call this virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Icelandair counts have been in a gray area when airlines were dismissed
Societal Minister Icelandair believes has been in a gray area when the company quits all airlines in the middle of a nuclear race.
Then he claims that laws that meant firefighters to enter an apartment house are taken into consideration after the Burn of the Brothers City.
On July 17th, Icelandair was advised to quit all the 38 airlines who served them in the company while the airline’s nuclear combat was still on the board of a national trader.
The division was of concern about whether Icelandair had the right to take this statement and was prepared for the matter to be resolved for the Court of Justice.
However, airlines and Icelandair never ended after the reports.
On the other hand, a social minister, Ásmundur Einar Dadason, says that in his view, Icelandair’s decision was in a gray area and went to the right payer.
“ My view is that this is a certain right to defend payers.
When you're in conversation, when you're in the saddler, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear in my mind that this wouldn't have stood.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into the grey area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
He will not speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“You also see a dangerous discussion now that it’s only normal to get this system upstairs to reduce these rights, so I’m totally opposed. ”
At the explosion of this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the reaction of governments to the burn at a brother - in - city journey at the end of June, where three deaths died.
A consultant now explains the study on the board of the House and the Human Agency, which he directed.
“ Today’s law does not allow the firearm to enter the apartment home.
I have asked the House and Human Agency to examine specifically whether there is a reason for making some legal change.
I'm ready to make the legal changes necessary to reduce the likelihood that such things can happen again," says Ásmund Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
The United States said to increase the pressure on entrepreneurs Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to the World on Sunday, the United States Government has made further efforts to force a European company to resign from the North Stream 2 gas transport project, which is led by Russia, to be a witness to people who are familiar with the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy have contacted European entrepreneurs to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing in the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that in a “friendly ” tone, the Americans stressed that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from being real.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one of them to the German press.
These threats are in accordance with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best to “come out now” or have a risk of punishment according to 232 parts of the total law Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian Energy Gazprom, who is responsible for the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In conversation with the World on Sunday, the representative of the latter company said that the United States' attempts to undermine “important interior projects” would be a clear interference in the European power.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Representative Assembly agreed to change the laws on national protection intended to extend the US penalties against companies participating in the settlement of the Russian North Stream 2 gas supply.
According to one transporter of the legal television, the results can be directed on companies paying for or submitting ships, insurance, hailing, or connecting services for such ships, as well as those offering a witness to Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and official officials have repeatedly declared their disappointment in the American attempts to divide European energy by using punishment against North Stream 2, and some of them have even called upon Brussels to work for the benefit of operations.
Speakers in Moscow have also criticized Washington’s operation hardly and called it an unfair competition.
Earlier this week, President Dmitrij Peskov said that Russia would set up a new plan on how the project will be completed if the Washington Ministers maintain the new penalties in stress.
Preparing further transport of public authorities to land
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Languages intends to carry out more public institutions to land next.
In the autumn, the gross area of the House and the Human Agency is transferred north of the Sheep Arc that the Council's decision, but specialists in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move farming north.
Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children’s Languages, said in Sprengsandi on the Gulf this morning that it would be important for the rural area to transfer public institutions there.
Therefore, there is a great valuable creation that also has a variety.
“ This is societal, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Employment construction, monetary construction, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some natural use, and this kind of work as a public service they are very well supporting for their construction," says Ásmundur.
“Increasing diversity, creating better support for this resource exploitation and the monetary creation of the nation. ”
The decision of Ásmund to transfer the fireplaces of the House and the Human Agency has been severely criticised by its employees and by the Federal Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters.
Six men who have speciality in burning and working in the branch are all resident in the capital area, and none of them wants to move lives to the Sheep’s Cork.
“ I think it’s quite clear that it’s a politically diversified view of how hard to do this.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take a rotary action to distribute the public jobs better," says Ásmundur.
“ We see that our neighbouring nations, Norwegians, and Danir have done this with good results. ”
He is convinced that the majority of the nation want to see greater distribution in public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of official work to land, just as I was doing with a House and a Human Agency.”
He illustrates the transportation of a Food Agency on Selfoss, Iceland’s landmeters to Akraness and Unemployment Insurance at the Skagastrain.
“ There is a workplace on the Skaga Coast today that is important to that society.
I think we should step further in this being."
“ I’m preparing further steps in this being.
More transport."

Gottlieb warns that the proliferation of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in the autumn
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former supervisor of the United States’ Food and Medicine Surveillance, warned on Sunday that if the crown virus is spread in these communities, it will be “very difficult ” for school areas to open up in a new course.
“ I believe that school authorities everywhere need to examine how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus is distributed in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that state," said Gottlieb in "The Face of the Nation".
Since the autumn should begin in the next weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged school authorities to open up their schools for students and offer education in schools five days a week.
However, these experiments by President Trump and Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the chronic virus age would probably “swap before he improves” and confirmed the school area in those places where the situation may have to delay the opening of school for a few weeks.
Yet, on Thursday, sickness centers issued instructions on the safest way to open school for students.
The counsel includes the distance between people of loyalty, students and employees in schools, advised to use face protectors and that students are divided into limited groups to reduce infectious pathways.
However, the CVs did not issue the standards for school managers about when to close schools if chronic virus infections are increasing, as Godlieb says has been “unpleasant. ”
“ When this state of uncertainty and precise counsel has not been given on how schools are opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“This is why I think it is very important to get accurate information about the precise standards that the Disease Control Centre did not give in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb said school areas must consider the proportion of positive infectures in society, local dissemination and testing when decisions are made about whether to keep schools open or switch the alpha in web education.
If there is a positive conclusion between 5 and 10% of analysis, "the matter is going to be difficult" but over 10% is "the threshold when considering whether to close schools".
“ This is the sign that the epidemic has reached its footing in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the Florida, the most important of the United States’ chronic age, difficult to open for school education for the next month.
Coronary virus infections have increased to more than 30 countries and the Columbia region than the gravity of the epidemic, which is located in the solar belt known as the southern coast of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said that there were signs of slowing down in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, even though Godlieb had said that there were “significant signs ” of slowing down the epidemic in some countries of the sunbelt, it has become “hitting in the coal ” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indian, and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped reopening of destinations to contradict the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that governments should consider closing stocks, limit the number of people at restaurants, close movie houses and other places offering entertainment and lay down rules for masking use to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that enable countries to avoid recovering the strict limitations set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the fact that various countries have made use of masks, various companies have obliged people to use face defendants.
McDonald's sudden bitarian is the latest company to make the use of face defenses obligatory and adds it to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he expected that more companies would take up a mask, especially where the risk is considered to be great.
“If we can really control the epidemics when the winter goes on until we get vaccines or any form of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something we can all do, but that does not change our lives directly and allows us to keep what is very important for us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Although last week Donald Trump did not say he wanted to make mask use in all the country, he urged the Americans last week to use face - defenses and said at the White House newsletter meeting that “these have influence. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s a time to expect.”
Crystal Palace had a message for the summer when Roy Hodgson, head of the Society, declared that the attendant, Mrs. Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
The truck has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be going, but it has been used to be called at a team like Arsenal and Bayern München.
Since he is now aged 27 years after showing whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay for him a high sum, especially in the financial uncertainty hours of sport this summer, after the period of Zaha checked four limits and made five supports for the Palace team that caused some disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the period, Hodgson said that “the news is to be expected” as to the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the attendee“ had made it clear ” that he would see his future else than with the company.
There are still three years left of the attendant’s contract at Palace, and last year, the company indicated that 100 million sterile pounds would need to make the company hold him.
At the end of Hodgson, the period ended with seven losses in a row and a match on the last day of the period, which led the team to fall to the 14th place.
Zaha found the net mice only once from the middle of December until the end of the period with long losses against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get rid of the company, but there was no offer to tempt Palace to sell.
In January, Zaha changed the officer, that it seems to increase the chances of leaving the company, and in the next few weeks it will be without doubt a priority for him to ensure social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English Deputy for Palace during the period, and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction of the team could be necessary to attack with the resources available for the player.
The Fellibyl Hanna: The Korean Virus Risk of Texas is faced with a high risk of floods of disaster in “two cramps”
In southern Texas, weather reporters have foretold “disaster floods ” after the two - day turbulent Hanna arrived in the country, resulting in great rainfall and wind strength up to 40 meters a second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first stage storm (the lowest level of five levels) and has now been moved down to a tropical storm, but rain could still be around 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters in seconds.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first turbulent of the Atlantic Atlantic period in 2020, and the weatherologist Chris Birchfield advised the people to be careful: “This is not closer to the end yet; we are still expecting floods of disaster. ”
The last few weeks, Texas has had a great increase in chronic virus infections.
The governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster notification for 23 counties on the road of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All turbulents are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even more difficult, where the molecule passes through areas that have become the worst because of COVID-19," said Greg.
The land came first at 17:00 a.m. on Saturday, 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, about 210 kilometers south of Corpus Christ.
The second time wasn't far away, in the east part of Kennedy County.
More than 43.700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
The Corpus Christ’s emergency service set up gardens near gates to use them if they flood over the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States said that governments were watching Hanna and Douglas, who went to Havai in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm nearby had increased the anxiety she felt because of the world epidemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems related to chronic lung disease.
She said: “This is almost like a double trick for us.
I think many have become weak.
We'll get through this.
They're all good and strong and stand together."
Hearing on a blowing sailing in Southern
In some parts, the weather has been very good for farmers.
Most of them are finished with the first sleeve, a second sleeve is widely started, and then some are expected to reach the third sleeve at the end of summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, like other residents of the land in summer, and not corrupting the spring on the thin farmers.
So it's been good for you to hear it.
The victory of August, a cowboy in the Birtingholte in the rainboat, and a workshop in celebration is satisfied and happy.
“Yeah, it has just gone brilliantly well, I think that farmers must just be broken, it’s been walking fine end has been very good weather last half a month.
Hey, the very good end of the harvest is good, and the quality of the hooks are well over," says Victory.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in cowboys, that they are in flat grinds or outdoors, which have been given very well, but it is far the best to do in the rolling party.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, this has actually been very comfortable now the last half of the month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and it’s so comfortable to do so.
It remembers everything, it is less stress and can be stored for the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it is brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victory think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, those who were first.
We started the 17th of June, it could be quite that those who were the first had to take something three times."
Initial solution for the wolves - how they prevent the injury
The Candle Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is a huge fast player.
His opposers have been able to grip him to make sure that he can’t pass away from them.
This has caused his axle to fall out several times, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, a nurse could see something on the shoulders of Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a author in Wolves, but what was carrying on him was a child oil.
“ Making him a sleepper makes the defenses harder to grip him, so we can prevent further injury. ”
When Wolves played against Tottenham in December, his shoulder of Traoré fell out of a team.

Stott, in his conversation with Sky News, said that the contents of the book on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no different matter of the gossip, the only difference was that the book was bound.
The former soldier wants more and more seas to be directed to the positive part of their husband and wife, such as their good - done work.
Stott said: “I feel what is happening there in no different way from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a boundary book. ”
“ There’s a historian who tells us, but there is no doubt that this is from them. ”
“I think this is just another attack on them, just like the gossips that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the scene light, and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish they would be discussed more about all the good they have done and their good work rather than their personal matters. ”
“ Of course, they never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duke and the Duke of Sussex shaded the other members of the king’s family, according to a specialist in the history of the king’s family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the king’s family had not managed to use the constellations of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for their sake.
She added that the rulership of the king’s family was firm, but that the interests of the public could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the Queen had a tendency to shine against other members of the king’s family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They're really popular."
“ They had less wedding than most brothers and sisters in the same position, Andrew had a giant wedding, Anne also had a giant wedding. ”
“But although Harry and Meghan were smaller than Willhelm and Katrine, news was as much, because of the world’s interest in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he frequently follows his records on Twitter, who are fighting.
At the Interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his unattended re-reflections on Twitter items – which some have contained materials from the white racer – would be the most difficult.
When the reporter Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his entries, Trump answered: “Oft, too often.
It was like this in ancient times, before this came, that you wrote letters and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back next day and said, "Oh, how happy I am that I didn't send this," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start to get a call — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" And you're gonna find out differently."
In the last month, Trump caused great anger after re-publicing the entry (disputed material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area in Florida, where an elderly pair called “White power” or “Select White”.
And in 2017, Trump reopened three entries directed against the Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, the leader of the British Right Exponential Group First.
The President told Portnoy that the re-reflections that had brought him into the most trouble
Trump said: “Man sees something that looks good and does not investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what is on the helmet, which is small and you don’t enlarge it, sometimes – I’ve found out that it’s almost always the rebirth that brings you into trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation to himself, a voice of his opponents, and conspiracy teachings with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television shows and newspapers, which he tells of untrueness.
But the President’s lies have often been understood, and now the Twitter records of Trump represent a misunderstanding.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many countries are working to develop different location techniques than the GPS system.
The engineer says that there might be reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the United States Army.
The old Loran system has been renewed.
The GPS technology follows us to every footing.
We use it when flying, sailing, and driving, with land measurements, in industry, and on holidays.
Most people think that it is a military device in possession of the United States Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1990 ’ s.
GPS-technology uses coordinates from a satellite cell to a height of 20,000 kilometres above the earth, so natural conditions have little influence on it.
“ But it’s very easy to interfere with it.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs," says Seemundur E. Thorsteinsson, a technician at the University of Iceland and an expert on risk management and communication security.
He also tells us that it is easy to send errors with the wrong location, for example in a military.
“The GPS system is owned by the United States Defence Department.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very special president to let him do this, then he could probably do it," said Seemundur.
So many countries have started thinking of other systems and location techniques.
Both Russia and China are working their own satellite systems, and the European Union is shaping Galileo’s location system off the stocks.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have more precision and is naturally under the European Union's control.
Then there's not one government that's totally controlling it, but many," says Seemundur.
But many have also looked back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the sixth decade and until GPS technology took over.
The Loran marks are sent on very long waves from shipped down to the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system to be reserved, because it is a little different laws to disturb it, it is much more difficult than disturbing a satellite system, ” says Saemund.
However, most of the location systems are most likely to be accessible.
Tested Senator Vern Buchanan’s employee died by the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in the fingerprint and a virtue servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many, and he was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how exciting he was, the mind of humor, and the joy that he received in helping others."
Buchanan’s office published an announcement earlier in the month, where it appeared that Tibbetts had not had any recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside of the office, had worked for Buchanan from 2011.
Florated States have reported about 414.511 cases since the beginning of the world epidemic, more than 41.200 in New York, according to health authorities in the countries.
The data from the state’s health authorities show that hospitalization has increased by 79% since the National Festival Day of the United States, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 branches in Florida reached patience on Saturday.
“ We let us know that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and remedy could have a negative effect. ”
A flight from the Hornet to Cape Town
Thieves, rosers, circular dove, screws, glitters, and crystals are among the birds that have embedded here in the summer.
On the web of the birds’ birds of the Southeast, there are nearly daily short news about the complicators, where they have been seen and sometimes their sex.
They are many bird interesters in Iceland.
For this purpose, the number of those who like the Facebook page islandic species of birds can be mentioned.
The members of the group are about 14.600.
There are shared pictures of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is dominated by good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynilf's son is one of them.
It, as he is called, is an employee of the South Eastern and the South Eastern Natural Institute of Fuglity, and is closely monitored for the bird life in that area.
He talks beautifully about these animals that enrich the realm in Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large robbery or a small bird.
It was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Half-Dán Bearson at Kvikskeren in Öräsch, with the aim of maintaining and continuing the significant natural studies he conducted from 1940.
“ Half - half was thirteen years old when he began to carry out information about birds, ” says Brynberg in a conversation with the Kernen.
“ We at the bird research station are not doing exactly the same thing as the Half Dog, but we are based on his data by counting and labelling birds. ”
Half - death was a farmer and a general scientist, born 14 March 1927.
He wrote numerous scientific articles about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, nearly nine years old.
Half - death and his brothers and sisters in the Kwisschers were interested in many of them who were acquainted with the Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gisli Arnarson, “the other employee” of the Fuglat thought station.
A bear grew up on the Reverend Valleys in Southern France, and he had abundant natural sprinkle at its neighbors, a Half - peasant on the Quesques.
But what does the bird - thought station in Southeastern do?
About March 20th, each year, the bird - thought station sets up a special bird in Singles, a tree dose within the Horn of Horn.
There are standard marks of the birds that come into the nets.
The networks are taken down around May 10, when the warp time starts.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o'clock in the morning and until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in which they come are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a newspaper in the forehead asks.
“ Yes, we divide this with us, I and Bösser.
Since we need to work for ourselves now, this can be a lot of a pussy, but somehow we can do this," says Brynilf.
The networks are then set up again during the period of August 1 to November 10 — every day weather permits.
Between watching the nets and during the periods they are not present, Brows and Bear mark cruels, shoms, and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take up various special tasks.
One of these projects is collaborated with the Icelandic Natural Institute and is about collecting forests of birds.
“ The forest mill pops on the birds in their winter stations and then brings them here to the land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, and therefore, when they come to Iceland, they are not large.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another hospital when he needs to keep it."
But plenty of myts.
Asked how the birds in Southeastern have this summer, Brown Yelf says that the warp of the cruel seems to work well — over the heads of it.
“Apart from the warp of the crown here is at Hala, Southern Army, and there it's all right.
On the other hand, there is no waste to find more at Jackulsarlon, where there was a huge warp a few years ago."
He says that a few years ago, there were more than a thousand crystals there, but now they can be counted on other hands.
“When we look at mosquitoes and waterbirds, I feel that the last few years have reduced what you feel about them.
But, of course, there's always a change between the years."
What can explain such a great change is probably about the offering of food.
"It's all about food."
Then humans can also have work to say about the descendants of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have it very good in Southeastern this summer.
“ One of the positive things that I feel is to be cold is to increase again after great lowness, ” says Brynilf, “but during the past few years and decades, the shams have fallen terriblely. ”
Of mosquitoes, it appears that the marijuana will be walking well in some of them, just as last year.
Forest thirsts and youths had declined slightly, but Browny River says it does not appear until in the fall of the summer how this summer has been proved to them.
But let's turn to the complicators.
Often they make great attention, especially if they are very foolish and even colourful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular complications of summer: the Rose Star.
“ Others have been relatively calm in some of the complications, ” says the Brine River, but notes that the country is now finding a crystal, and then ringduves have been seen and are beginning to shop here.
Like other birds, when Brows and Bears come to the point of complication, they also mark them.
Signs are international, and they are being exercised worldwide.
The meanings, such as the bird’s winter stations, where they work, and where they are.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on flights, ” says the Brünjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, to form in the event of pestilences such as bird breeds.
“ There is always a growing knowledge. ”
If any outside the world finds a bird marked by the South Eastern Research Centre, the information is transmitted to the Icelandic Natural Institute.
“We have been recovered from Cape Town of South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One crown from us later found in the United States."
One of the birds is the Brünniv, especially the mind, and that is the sham.
“ The shoe is our bird, ” he says, “the bird’s bird’s research station and its natural office of Southeast is the task of watching its offspring — which has become quite weak, and now it’s on the list.
It is difficult to claim what has caused a fall in the strains, but one doctrine is that the shampoo has made a seapiece that was previously enshrined by fishing boats to the sea to the good, but that it has now become much better to use it and that it affects the shampoo.
Are you at the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You naturally don’t make me say no, ” laughing Brynilf, adding: “Where we are also chasing birds, we must probably go farther. ”
Yet, the Southeast is a special one in bird life.
“This area is like the land of Europe, and then the birds spread from here.
Being here looking at birds and birds of flooding is very interesting than there is less of warp birds than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the feather and to the yoke, so that the area that such is suitable for the examination of birds."
But is there a favorite bird?
He thinks about himself for a short time before he answers.
The question seems to be difficult.
“I have found nine of the ten that have seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I now find one of the most fun taking pictures of horsesaging.
So it's always fun to find birds who haven't seen before in the country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But they both have done that.
If you want to monitor the work of Binna and Bjussa at the birds research station South Eastern, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the birds.is web
Saedi Arabia — The Sun’s Coast of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
Travelling industry has grown enormously in the world in recent years, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want to get their cookie.
The governments think to spend about a billion dollars of Iceland, making a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Icelander should get used to in southern Europe.
Beverages will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunk in bikinium.
How, then, should travelers be locked to this strictly believed Islamic country?
For example, this should be done by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made of humans), drones, and robots who serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the colon Prince of Sadi Arabia, who wants to put in this investment.
Of course, the money will be infected in the land’s oils.
The crown prince says that there is no discussion that women can avoid covering shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot there when the sun is high and cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
However, if they cannot buy alcohol, they may wonder if they are not also deprived of the interests of the future travelers.
Francois Bozize, previously stuck by the Central African People's Presidency, announced a presidential procurement
On Saturday, former President of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been stuck by a chair, announced that he would offer himself to the presidents of the United Nations in December, despite the action of the United Nations, and that a arrest order had been issued because of his meant crime against mankind.
He announced his offer in a speech before a large group of supporters in his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work ”), in Bangui, the capital.
In 2013, this 73 - year - old former general and soldier was likewise elected in the rebellion of a union to the largest Muslim Rebels from the north, who destroyed the majority of the nation to Christian, in a persistent civil war and a serious and long - term human cruelty.
“The country needs a person with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a talk criticized by the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first received power after the elections in 2003 and had a presidential office for 10 years before he escaped the country in 2013.
The new government tried to arrest him for defendant crime against humanity and for encouraging genocide, but it has not been arrested since he returned from exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign penalty operations affect its offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to repeal the penalty operations set in 2014 because of support for armed Christian groups of Antibalaka.
Touadera runs the country today with the support of the United Nations' extensive peacekeeping policy, which accounts for more than 13,000 soldiers and policemen.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to offer himself for a second period, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be 27 December.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has decreased but still occurs bloody events that are mostly caused by conflicts with resources, but most of this demant country is not under the government.
Violence has used more than 1.5 million people to escape their homes.
The state of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is "unacceptable to everyone," says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the center of Real Madrid, says the status of Gareth Bale at the Spanish team is “inappropriate to everyone. ”
Bale did not take part in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a little part in the LaLiga joy of Los Blancos, and now in the summer it is up the path that the player intends to keep stand before and let his contract run out, but the company hopes he disappears.
“ There is no way to avoid being unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos at Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but so said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that.
When he was asked whether the circumstances had negatively affected the atmosphere of Real, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked something important together."
Chinese administration of Reykenesby 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the chronic virus
Chinean’s messenger, Jin Zhijian, delivered the city leader of Reykjane, two thousand face masks in the past week.
On July 22, last year, the citizen’s mayor visited the Chinese ambassador.
The news first reported.
The citizen’s visit was to reimburse the visit of the Chinese ambassadors in Reykjanesb, where he visited the city hall and met with the city manager.
Says Vikar News that there was a discussion of strengthening the community’s cooperation between the town of Reykjane and the city of Xianyang, but the community started their cooperation between 2014.
The gifts, 2,000 face masks, are due to this friendship, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the chronic virus age.
In a news news news reports that the masks are used in sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjane for both employees and other guests coming there.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and the Republic of China, the inscription of the face mask box, which says “Ber is one behind, not a brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculate to lower in wages
Tobias Thomsen will try to get home to Danmark, from Iceland Master KR, for the next month, and claim to be interested by partners in the Danish 1st department.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become an Icelandian champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old attendant says that he is missing Danmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania, Jacob’s daughter.
The Danish Contract with KR applies to the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would need to negotiate with KR about a price to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until the winter to get to Danmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish departments start again at the end of August.
That of course means that I had to break my contract with K-inga but I have told them that I miss Danmarks, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer who had shown his full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not believe that the price would be a great problem.
“ I have also had a conversation with two branchmates after the end of the department and I knew where they would end.
It has been a little interest in the coming period now so it may well be that I go to Danmark before the Icelandic department quit," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many partners in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been interesting.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said to look first and foremost to the Copenhagen port.
Thomsen said KR-inga didn't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all in practice and games, even though he missed Danmarks.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do the things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook because I miss Danmarks when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, which clearly says he'll lower his wages by leaving the Iceland Masters in the next Danmark department.
“ I’ll probably have to lower only in the wages, because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have scattered the Danish companions only more than those in Icelandic.
But I am also studying, and one solution may be that a company has provided me with a job.
Most of the associations in the 1st department are agreements with a supporter.
I'm learning sports management through the players' association and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the KR start team in two games in the Pepsi Max Division in this season, but came to history in five games and checked one goal.
He started 21 games before the team last year, scoring seven limits.
KR is equal to the points at the top of the Pepsi Max department and is playing for good, but the team is coming to Akureyri today.

Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disabilities more often
The girl is involved in a new fight about the increased participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is ongoing at the same time as 30 years since the United States’ laws on the rights of people with disabilities, which appear on Sunday.

Cooperation against hunger pushes Yoho side by side after events in the Senior House
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization who wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to declare himself of the government of the Congress, and that he had become it, after they called “attack ” on the senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, parliament of Democrata in New York, accused the Republican senator Yoho of Florida of using low - courageous and male arrogance when he reproved her when they met on the stairs of the Senior House last Monday.
Yoho argued that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the event confirmed that the word had been as she described it.
Bread for the World said that on Friday, Yoho had met the government of the Congress, seeking to say that he would “justify our commitment to stand with women and skin - dark people, inland and in the world, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World’s website, their “common Christian voice ” presses the Congress and governments to bring an end to hunger in the country and in the world.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of the Christian organization, which has the goal of reducing hunger and poverty with strong public policies, the organization keeps the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we deal with people in powers, wherever it is on the political color, ” says the declaration.
“In our opinion, the recent acts and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements made for our members. ”
During the work of the news, a speaker Yoho had not responded to an email with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the Senatorial House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramaticly spoke of the event and directed her words against what she called a male revenge who “accepts violence and a violent expression against women. ”
More than a dozen of her colleagues underlined her words that the event was an example of the overly common conduct of men.
Yoho described the event as a brief discussion of policy and that “nobody had been anxious, fooled, or attacked. ”
He said he regretted the “extreme face. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in its first period as an advanced Senator and has received both praise and last for her cleanliness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most consensus of the Congress, and he will sit in a sacred stone after the end of his fourth term.
Waiting for the first target of the period at the 98th minute in the local fields
Jesse Lingard had not investigated or invested in the English decoration during this season until he invoked Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final tour of the department.

Players Real Madrid Exempted Rules of Disease
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in Europe’s Championship Department, without having to go for two weeks of disease.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain have to go for two weeks of disease, in order to inhibit the spread of the chronic virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of competition teams at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The board says that the individuals who are exempted from the rules will only be in limited areas, in front of close doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
Madriding, therefore, can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2–1 below in the enemy after losing Santiago Bernabea on February 26th.
The victory team will continue in the 8-long finals in Portugal.
Raining and Lowering on the Land of Shopping Holy
Of the news of overwhelming hotels and tent areas to judge, at least south, it is clear that the Icelanders have been busy traveling in this summer.
If those who have been landed under the foot have also been lucky with the weather and weather providers DV in one case that the summer was only clearly said beautiful, here to at least.
But now it’s time for a merchant’s sanctuary, which has been the most traveling sanctuary of the year.
Yet, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, but events that in normal years have brought a large number of people to be avoided.
For example, it is enough to mention a national feast.
The weather will, of course, play a great role, but now the appearance of decay rain across the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather room predicts rainfall from Thursday evening and at least until Saturday evening.
For example, long - term predictions are not a sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean and can naturally change.
The meteorologist knocked Einar Svine Bear’s son, in his forecast of his weather tissue, Blixe, says that the expectation of the sacred saint is reduced.
Says he: Loading drips in the lofts with a corresponding cold that too often reaches to the surface, leads to a warmer air from the southwest attempts to reach only a lowness of wind and descent.
Surely, too, a warmer air that “firms ” here north.
One of his prophecy cards is foretold and says: “A little wave from America is coming to the east and with it a summerly air.
When approaching, it will “blomme ” in the form of lowering air pressure and considerable summer levels. ”
The large forecast, the European calculator to the left on the map, and the US GFS prophecy to the right, are somewhat contradictory with this development.
The understanding of the slightness goes over late on Thursday and early on Friday with a bright A-port and rain on most of the whole land.
The lowering centre of 985 hPa follows the following.
At this time, some warm air follows in the North and East on Saturday and even on Sunday.
On the other hand, it could blow.

Following a actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“ I was shot into her as a man gets such a youth, ” says Birna Mr. Björn’s daughter about Marisku Hargitay, the main playster of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so strangled by her actress that she arrived at the recording site of the parts and waited for her for hours, just to be able to say hello.
When Birna Hrönn Björn’s daughter, the owner of the Penny Iceland Travel Office, looked like many Icelanders at the Law and Order tensions: Special Victims Unit from the centuries, she was a collar for the main playwoman of the Marisku Hargitay.
Birna tells us about her meetings and her actress in the feature Love Stories at Council 1.
When Birna was a teenager, in the age of which many begin to develop overwhelming love, she did not feel like her companions, because she was in a strange position to suppress her own feelings.
She felt interested in boys’ bands and young champagneous heartcrews from movies, but she did not.
“ I was cutting out pop leaves and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says sometimes that when people come out of the closet, they are going through a laterly prepared barbecue.
“ We spend our teenage years pushing down these youths, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her shoes."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran on the circuit.
One of her best friends, Erling Further Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in the city and brought Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga, the son of God, to help with the cabs.
“ We were working in 30 teams and spending good time with strangers.
This is naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend such a long time a day so it was spoken of everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great marijuana fan.
One woman in the band says her friend is familiar with the actress because he was in the play team of the parts.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend would like to work with her actress and whether Birna could get her to meet her.
“ She tells me to stop this, she doesn’t know if she can let it happen, ” says Birna.
Finally, when the movie is taken, the group is finished, and Birna will last try to convince the woman to try to come around the meeting.
“ She had got some glasses and said she would just make this. ”
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message and asks if there is something in the matter.
The woman does not answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she then wakes up at a long - term message.
“ I look at the phone, and I shout.
Gunnar Holy wake up at the scream, and I say, I have to do a shower, and I must make myself fine, and go down to town.
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the play team Law and Order were present at a hotel at Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, do you well, ” says the message, and Birna dresses herself faster, as she asks the reception where to go and take the elevator up to 45th height, where the group is gathered together.
Birna comes and waits for a woman from the staff to come to her and asks this uninvited woman if it can help.
“ I say I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here. ”
When his friend finally comes, he looks out of the face of Birna and asks her how she came all the way to the seat.
Birna explains that she has just taken the elevator and asks for a meeting with Marisku.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend and Birna are stumbling.
At her side, an extra player sits in the parts, and they begin to talk.
“ I say to him, I am a fan, but you?” says Birna.
“ I played it like this was the most normal thing in the world. ”
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The players come up regularly when a break is taken, they get talks, and Birna looks around and seeks Marisku, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he's leaving.
Birna asks him to put another employee in his hands, and she did not want to go immediately.
A marvelous friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He brings his second friend and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who would like to see Marisku. ’ ”
Then he's going.
Finally, in two hours, the new friend will run to Birna.
“ He says, Hurry.
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her so she won't stop anything.
She's going the directest way to the car with them, so you'll have to take the chance and go down and find her bike.
It's white, and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose the face" Birna goes on and brings the elevator down to the Times Square.
There she feels about forty bikes, some marked and some not.
However, Marisku’s bicycle house does not find it, and then desperately, she gets crushed.
“ I feel that the blowing was pouring over me because I had spent half a day on this, but then think well, I tried.
It was fun."
Irreally, Birna keeps back to the hotel, where she looks through the window of the band watching herself with pity eyes and realizes that Birna did not succeed in her intentional work.
Birn accepts the destiny, and it starts raining.
“ I go under a cover to hide from the rain.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
No other than Mariska Hargitay was there in the pants drain she dressed in the parts, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly be moved by mental arrogance.
“ I look at the body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go towards her."
Bears do so and recall to pick in the axel of the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I just greet and say hello," Birna recalls.
“ I say I am about Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's great to meet you."
The conversation did not reach much longer than Marisku’s car is here, and it’s overwhelmed.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna greetes the god of faith, looks at the car driving away, and then breaks together.
“ I call Erling and Gunna challengingly, and they thought this wouldn’t have succeeded.
But I was crying of excitement and joy.
I say, "Yeah, I'll meet her. You have to meet me now.
Then we swallowed into soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She does not look after anything, even though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this one time in your life, spending such time and energy in doing so.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen discussed with Birna Mr. Björn’s daughter in the section Love Stories at Ras 1.
Police does not spread the virus
There is no reason to worry about the fact that the crown virus can be used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the headquarters of the police in conversation with others.
Indications have been obtained from people who are worried about the use of the same mouthpiece for all drivers when the police take care of the roadway, and all who have a blow.
The police, however, say the best of hygiene.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, ” says a policeman.
“ Some want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few tens of centimeters. ”
Asked if it takes enough distance, a policeman says so.
If it seems positive, the police are then used at another measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Gastrointestinal disorders: Among other things, anis can be installed to reduce pain
The connections to depression are not coincidence.
Individuals suffering from renal inflammation, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, humour, windgang, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of the symptoms of anxiety and depression of the United States (ADAA).
“ This is because the rupture is part of the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the theme does not decrease, food intolerance may be discussed.
Judge tries to stop the decision that children should be released from the immigration authority
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee cancelled the expected time limit by saying that immigrants and tolerance authorities in the United States do not have to release children if they are not able to do so with any of the three ways described in her previous order.
However, Gee also stressed the obligation of immigrant and tolerance authorities to release their children without unnecessary delay.
The three ways that Gee suggested are to bring together families held by immigrants and tolerance authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible person, or to leave families free to the Federal Court of Justice.
Shalyn Fluharty, head of the Proyecto Dilley Institute, who gives families a legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the immigrant and tolerance authorities to decide whether they should continue to have children.
“The most important thing I think is that children are kept in prison in an early time and they are not released unless the immigrant and tolerance authorities agree it or families agree to be divided,” said Fluharty.
Familys are held at three locations of immigrants and toll authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Texas County of Karnes.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years old according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in Maintenance, said in June that as “the rules on masking and social distance would not or would be badly followed” it would be urgent to transfer children from these workstations.
969 people in surveillance in the migrant and tolerant authorities have been diagnosed with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from 23 July, according to the migrant and tolerant authorities.
There are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the preservative centres for families.
Over 3700 cases have been preserved
Will review the settlement of governmental independence
A presidency minister does not say unusually that life - allowing treasures set their own investment policy on the rights of workers.
Notes of the CB manager to ensure the need for independence of governments, possibly by law, will be taken into account.
Following Icelandair's discussions with the Icelandic Aviation Society and resigning all airlines, the Government of the VR declared that the governments of the VR appointed under the management of the Living Supply of Shoppers were unable or voted against the participation of the Liquid Fund in the expected partial mission of Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Ingolf’s son, President of VR, said that governments would be replaced if they did not respond to the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor returned its declaration three days later, as well as the VR.
Assgei Johnsson, bankruptcy manager of the banks, said in the news of RUV on Friday, that the independence of governments would need to be guaranteed in the consent of the funds and possibly by means of legal change.
Katrin Jacob’s daughter, Prime Minister, says importantly that the rulers of life are independent, but it is already considered legally secured.
“ Now, the bank manager, who of course has the financial oversight that has to do with this, has said that if something needs to go over there, we need to consider the regulatory work around this independence specifically, of course, ” she says.
Katrine says that laws should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It would be desirable to discuss the social and moral standards that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“ I thought nothing unusual likewise that life - allowing treasures also set their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I think that such decisions are taken through policy, not through special investment decisions," says Katrin.
“Intolerable traffic traps at the Elf Year Bridge,” says the President of the City Government
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Government, says a cartridge, forming at the Elf Year Bridge of Selfoss every day completely intolerant.
He hopes that a new bridge over Elfsaw will take place in the autumn.
Now that the Icelander travels through their land and a huge traffic on the roads of the country, there is a daily traffic trap at the Elf Year Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the city community.
Long rows are created at edges and can take patience for drivers to wait in a row.
“Yeah, it’s absolutely intolerable, it’s one traffic trap here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just happening in the active days too.
There are long waiting, sometimes quite up on a Hellisheed for those who want to come over here on their way east to land and those who are coming to the west, so it gives an eye way that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the city government in Arborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in Årburg recently held a meeting with the director of the Vegetation and the designer of the Vegetation, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about the fact that it’s been working in these matters, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited to the fall. ”
But is there any counsel to the drivers who are in the queue at the Elf Year Bridge all the days over the summer time?
“Yes, that the tribulation can be gone and through the ears, it is fast, but those who go eastward, they cannot be pointed out to go to the Lungal, but those who are going to the troops should use the Mosfellsheath, the Congregation, and the Lungal Heather.”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the city government of Aarborg, says the cartridge, forming at the Elf Year Bridge at Selfoss intactly.
Long waiters arise every day at the Elf Year Bridge, and drivers often need to wait for a lot of time to get across the edges.
Then the only advice is to breathe deeply and to think something positive.
The future of coal bears in the north of Brisbane is prejudiced to organization
In addition to the vital home of coal bears, squirrels, and gray sharks, the area said that it would be an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Executives have appealed to the rejection of civil government to the Court of Justice of Organization and Environment, arguing that the construction is in accordance with the Civil Organization Act from 2014, would meet organisational and social needs that have not been fulfilled for this purpose and "may be done without any unreasonable effect".
There is great opposition to these planned operations in the nutrition environment.
The operators argue that even though it is fully in harmony with the organization, it could be changed if it does not satisfy requirements rather than reject it.
It includes many stages, including service stations, childcare, and 39 housing houses.
Public transmissions were more than 120 at the consulting time, and most protested with the suggestion that it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane stated that the city needed to buy the country to protect the coalberry.
“Adrian Schriner has to stop wasting taxpayers in the fight against the executives for judgment and buying this country in order to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane,” said Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes of coal bears in the natural area Mountain to Mangroves, where there are many coal bears. ”
Schriner said this week that the city government wanted the home of coal bears in the area to be protected.
“We didn’t find the suit suitable for the area,” said Schriner.
“I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will result in the conservation of the home. ”
Schriner said that maping in the home of coal bears was the common responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for exact maps of the home of coal bears supported by local authorities when they take application for treatment.
Sunshine: Next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, trainer Man Utd, was hoping that the team had guaranteed a third seat in the English decoration today.
The team will therefore play in the European Championship Department in the next period.
United had an equal or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2-0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ It’s a great success for the players to reach a third seat compared to how the situation has been during the period.
I think we boys could have overcome a spiritual belt by working such a great game, because we have lost twice in the preliminary period.
We knew we needed a decision today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys working titles," said Solskjær victory.
Manchester United still has the possibility of working titles during this period, but it has been played in the European Department in August and is as good as the 8-arrangement there.
Weapon break starts at midnight in the war-threatening Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — the Ukrainian army and the resistance forces in the eastern Ukraine are now preparing “a complete ” army break that will begin at midnight and as representatives hopes to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of resistance said that they had given their soldiers orders for a break of weapons and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said its army had “prepared” for the army break.
If it was achieved, it would "pay the way for implementing other regulations" of the Min-Fredes Convention, as stated by the Ukrainian President's office earlier this week, where the arms break was called a time-to-date step.
The objective of the Minsk Peace Assembly, which was conducted in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflicts between Ukraine and the separationists enjoying Russia, which began in 2014 following Russia's entry into the Crimean and the support of the country for separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fights.
The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine rejoiced both the gun break on Sunday and stressed the importance of making the agreement reached at the meeting in Paris in December.
President Vladimir Putin, Russian President, expressed concern over the call for Kiev that the Minks Convention was revised and said that the position of Volodimír Selenskij, the Ukrainian President, should be reflected in real actions.
Selenskii, however, stressed the need to take “frequenter actions ” to deliver the Ukrainians captured by rebels in Eastern Ukraine, on the embraced Crimskaga and in Russia, according to a statement from the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, the Ukrainian authorities may only be given authority over the borders of Russia in the areas in which the separationists have their powers when they have received widespread self-government and elections in the areas.
The agreement reduced conflicts, but the Ukrainian army and the rebels have continued to be shattered.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for other discussions, the Minsk Convention was supported and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selenski, who worked the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted the Ukrainian authorities to have authority over the borders for the first regional elections, but the governments of Kreml demand that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new arms retention agreement was reached on Wednesday for the support of a three-sided cooperation group, appointed by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore rejoiced by the EU officials.
At the conventional Sunday blessing on Peter Storg, Pope Francis also mentioned the armor break and said that it would be necessary to “rebuild confidence and lay the foundation for the very necessary and long - term reconciliation with the people. ”
Police: Man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached the car and the driver in the car ran off his weapon, according to the police.
Early Sunday, Katrina Ratliff, the spokesman of the police, told the newspapers that the shooting attack had taken place right before 22: 00 a.m. at protests in Austin.

The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.

Markasupe in the first victory of Blittle in July
A second of its first branch victory from June 29th, the IA was in the field, 5-3, in the Pepsi Max-Department of Men at the Copagogsfeld tonight.
On the contrary, screamers lose their third game in a row in the department.
After winning his first three games in the department, the Breit Moment played five games without celebrating victory and had suffered three in a row before the game with IA tonight.
It was, therefore, to do or to kill for the Blixe who came to the game with great strength.
Alexander Helgi, the son of Sigurd, led the team with a fine reward in the 11th minute after the Christian Steindor son had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the leadership after a very pleasant preparation of Giselle Eyelv’s son from the left.
In the first half of the game, screamers did not reach lands or coasts, where the press of their homes made them terrible for connecting shipments together.
Blinks were with all the powers on the field and reaped the third goal at the 36th minute when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen swallowed the Hornstorm of the Gunnlaugson.
Then Christ’s son of Steindor scouted his second goal and fourth target Blike only three minutes later.
However, the history of the first half game did not end there.
For the second time, when Tryggi Hrafn Haraldsson inspected a blowfire shortly before the playtime, Kwame Quee had broken the Viktor John’s son in the district of Blinca.
4–1 was therefore the state of the Breit Moment when the half-game fleet was faulty.
Only three minutes had passed from the second half of the game when the Skagamen repaired.
Hlyn Severar John’s son was then alone and unauthorized on a marked light, and easily driving the ball into the net after the Horn Castle of Mr. Harald’s son.
On the other hand, only three minutes later when he broke on Alexander Helga, a cruel man was broken within the IA.
The defendant was sentenced and Thomas Mikkelsen insisted on safety in order to transfer the 5-2 Breit Moment when only seven minutes had passed from the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen’s target, the Skagamen were reproving.
Anton Ari Einarsson, a target guard of Blitz, then encountered pressure from Viktor John’s son, gave the ball to the foot of Viktors where the ball rejected the net.
Incredible 5-3 situations were observed when less than ten minutes had passed from the second half of the game, which slowed down the market scoring following.
Despite the fine moves of both joints to add the limits, including two deadlines of Kwame Quee from the Breit Moment, they became no more and 5-3 victories of the Breit Moment final.
Thus, the first victory won a few months, from June 29, and has passed after the victory with 14 points at the third seat, two steps from the Val, which is sitting above and three from the top of KR.
However, KR and Valur have both games inside Blitz.
IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the department, but it has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the decade.
The puppy team is not at risk despite the White House's statements
The producers of the Hvolpas team were happy yesterday not to stop showing the child’s substance in the near future.
Following this statement, Kayleigh McEnany, a media representative of the White House, refers to the fact that the features, among other things, of legal dogs, are victims of “exclusion cultures”.
The Canadian manufacturers of the factors quickly responded to McEnany’s words, telling them that their fans had no need to worry about the future of the Hungary team.
A number of TV - series dealing with police jobs have been removed from the show in the United States in the past, following a protest age against police violence.
However, the puppy team is not including, despite its reputation in social media.
At a newspaper meeting in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that the President of the United States, Trump, was the counterfeit of “exclusion” culture, especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to the fact that the reporting or making of individuals or undertakings raises a hard response to social media and is called after the member is unauthorized for protests.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw that the shows of the Hvolpas Army, a pediatric agent, were stopped.
Likewise, the Cops and Live PD features, "says McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took a lawyer from sale, but there is no foot for that claim, according to the Defense Lego.
However, the factuality factors of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken from the exhibition in the western ocean.
Both parties are controversial for displaying films of real police tasks without the permission of individuals that appear there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspicion occurs
Christian Tomas ’ daughter, a family caregiver, answers questions about the family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
At this time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel well, but both of us have felt like we are missing something.
We have never been with others, and we have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and lack of confidence in whether the other party is looking around, thinking about adultery, even divorce, and changing to.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a marble that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question, and I am glad you have such an open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you had to think about this in each corner, couldn't discuss this and even take any step you could so later regret.
Everything on board, isn't it always the best?
The strongest predictions of happiness in the future and the stronger self - mind you have, the more likely is that you will have a spouse with a strong self - inspiration.
The reasons that relationships that start in adolescents are not always lifelong, are often because people are developing in each direction, but in those cases where they will be graceful, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop in your greatest formation years, it can be concluded that you have developed together and had a positive influence on each other’s self - mind.
In particular, we are drawn up by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is shaped by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relations form who we are.
Could you turn the example back and think, ‘ What do we have as others do not have? ’
What does this many years of speciality give us?
I allow myself to claim that the advantages can be much more than the defects.
You have shaped each other for years, and you can say that you are separately up to one another.
That's more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You say that you experience that you have missed something, but it is important to remember that big changes such as divorce and new relationships also follow accompanyers that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may lose from starting up again, learning to be alone again, getting acquainted with a new person, and bringing together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems, and possible something new and exciting.
But this does not just follow a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a disgusting job, which may never be as good as you have already done to each other.
Is that worth it?
Would you not, too, put your focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseenness, and newness in your relationship?
You guys haven't put shoes on the hill.
There is so much you can do to make this long relationship deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate that you have never done before?
Perhaps you need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is considerably more tolerance to various forms of relations and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multi-loving, or decide to terminate temporarily together.
I'm not telling you what you're supposed to do, yet no expert in your solutions, but perhaps it would lighten this heavy moisture that thrusts you, if you look at this and think about solutions.
What do you need then distrust and fear disappear?
You guys have been together for 29 years, it must mean you're able to do something together.
Take advantage of it as strength and keep your hands in the direction of your solution.
We urge our readers to send questions and wizards to Christin in email at: jonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the Family Angle, of course unnamed and fully confident.

Coleen Rooney advocate Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" rim at Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself from the accusations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between footballmates, their acquaintances were expected to be dramatic
Coleen Rooney has advised the star lawyer to defend Johnny Depp in his so - called "Wagatha Christie" law with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday emulates that Rooney ordered David Sherborne to defend himself from the accusations that she had been injured against Vardy, claiming that personal information was leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
A few days after data was submitted to the Supreme Court, where Rebekah Vardy, married attendant Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually according to Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine notes that the 38 - year - old mother of five children “haved suffered severe foam and anxiety, so she was afraid to go out of the house ” and that Vardy, who had then arrived seven months on the way,“ had been put into a hospital three times... because of anxiety caused by the entry and consequences of it. ”
Besides being a lawyer of Depp in his injury against the Sun, because of claims that the actor had beaten his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, with the case of the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex in their personal case against Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After satisfaction between the two football owners, those who know about a dramatic breakdown in the courtroom are expected to fail.
“If you found the Depp trial, do not underestimate the future war of the football owners,” said a author.
“Now this is a real war, and Coleen doesn’t give up, nor Becky, and it will be emotionally depressed. ”
Coleen Rooney argued that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked up-to-date stories about her.
She was named “Wagatha Christie” after having revealed how she lasted five months to gradually limit the number of friends who could see the updates of Instagram stories with her until only the account of Vardy remained.
Coleen said that the Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip, had set an opposing story.
In Vardy’s documents, who refused to be part of the matter, she claims that after Rooney published the accusations, “in order to cause great harm and enormous suffering. ”
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words and said that the claims about her suffering are only presented to the media and distracted attention from the facts of the matter.
A author said: “Becky’s documents are misleading, all of this is discovered. ”
That's the lawyer Paul Lunt of Brabner's lawyer in Liverpool, who has the case of Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former English master Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at the Kingsley Napley lawyer, London, is uncertain if she's still in charge of the lawyer.
President Coleen Rooney refused to interview.
Bidens cosmetic team refuses "Fox News Sunday" for interview one week after a interview with Chris Wallace with Trump
In a interview with Chris Wallace last week, the President of the United States, Trump, doubted that the expected president-promoting Democrat, Joe Biden, would handle the questionnaire that Wallace had fallen upon Trump.
We may never get a answer to that question — at least not at a time.
On Sunday, the Wallace audiences informed that the election team of Bidens had told Fox News that he was “not free” at the interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the class of Democrates, Joe Biden, would plump himself in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ In the week, we asked for a interview by the Biden election team, and they said that the former vice-president was not free. ”
“ We continue to ask each week, ” he added.
Trump’s council team has been criticizing Biden for months to avoid elections and newspaper meetings while meeting in interviews during the chronic virus age.
Although Biden has recently restarted his election tour, Trump and his companions have continued to be ridiculed to the former vice-president for “hielding” in their home in Delaware.
However, the delight of Bidens to meet public events has not enjoyed his offer, since recent investigations show that Biden has a good priority for Trump both in the country and in major struggles.
The average Real Clear Politics indicates that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all the countries of the four countries in 2016, turning them over to the Republican group when he worked the fight for the White House.
In the latest research Fox News Poll, Biden has a headquarters in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
Research also suggests that Biden has a little priority in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important struggles in these elections.
And research suggests that governments who were formerly trusted in the Cubits, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trumps and the former vice - president.
President-in-Offices of the White House offer themselves for a second term in the White House are often a vote fee on the President – and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and economics that are low due to the epidemic – and the President’s performance and history in both languages.
Kanye West and his psychiatric struggle
Today, the musician Kanye West prayed to his wife, Kim Kardashian, apologize for the comments he made in a high school.
The Chairman of Geometry believes that he seeks his creative power in the mental sphere, but a psychiatrist says importantly that people take medicines to keep the disease under control.
The Rapper Kanye West is not only one of the first and most powerful musicians of the contemporary, but he is as famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been largely advanced before open tents.
It made great attention when he announced earlier this month that he was offering himself to a president in the United States, and he held a emotionally depressed and distinguished speech.
Later, some of his distresses appeared on Twitter, claiming that his wife was trying to put him in a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published an announcement at Instagram, as she asked people to show understanding to her husband and family; he had psychiatric disease, and it would be difficult for his loved one to help him if he did not seek his own help.
Since then, he has been apologizing to her publicly.
This famous family is not the only one to deal with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have a psychopathy.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a superphysician at a London Hospital, knows the disease well.
“ This illness can cause so disturbances for the individuals and, in particular, their families and their loved ones.
Such awesomeness or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause disturbing grief.
And the other sides, the depression, it is often greatly dangerous, for it is a high frequency of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was beautiful that she was saying this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Today, Mr. Unnsteinsson, Chairman of Gethhelper, has struggled with psychopathy — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very pleasant imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly contrabass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harps.
And he is so profoundly creative, profoundly powerful, and clever in his powerful connection thinking, because a man is going to be with this connection thought that we who have been given to try to go into a violent state know so well."
Canye West doesn't want to take antipsychotics, because he thinks they're reducing his creative gift.
He has discussed the psychopathy, including on the record Ye.
It says it's his choice not to take medicine.
“Many feel that this creative element, which is part of this unhealthy connection thinking and the violent creative power of the fire that it has, is the natural defects of it often great suffering, and the centuries and dark basements and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says importantly that psychiatric patients are treated.
“ If you have a lot of excitement or mania, you’re not making amazing things, you just on the side.
And as when people get into serious depression, people are completely paralysed of that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Surely, ” says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance the medicines to help him most, and to destroy what is remembered for him and his capabilities and his creative power. ”

Ambassador wants a gun, a trunked car, and an injection vest - said submarines are the “deep Kingdom”
Politically appointed Ambassador of the United States here in the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who said he wanted to carry weapons in the news of CBS today.
Starting CBS as follows: “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “sick ” about his security since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
CBS refers to 12 diplomats, directors and former representatives, as well as individuals who are familiar with the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they wanted the ambassador’s permission to go about armed here in the country.
He should also have desired a breast - guarded car that traveled with him between Iceland’s locations and an injection vest.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to express whether the security of the ambassadors was threatened, but the representatives of the U.S. governments stated that the ambassador had been expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that it was safe here.
Yet, in the Icelandic newspapers, CBS would have been advertised by lifeguards, and if it would be done to meet the Ambassador’s requirements.
CBS reports that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to comment on the matter to the CBS.
However, according to its sources in the country, the U.S. news office has made no wish to the local governments of that subject.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of being armed because it would injure the host country, Iceland.
The messenger paid his dignity for a lot of support for Donald Trump's elections in the 2016 predecessions.
In the past, he was a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter accepted in May, he said that he had created a “impossible” work environment in the embassy and has already had seven substitutes, known as Deputy Chief of Mission, subjects to the ambassadors who are also delegated by Diplomats.
It was all proved by the U.S. Foreign Ministry.
The first one was sent away by the Ambassador “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
He had already been preparing for a year and had learned Icelandic.
The next one only lasted for six months.
Following this, the idea was to give Gunter a way as most until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter expected the ambassador’s staff to walk the “deep Kingdom ” and to have buried him against the Foreign Ministry in Washington, D.C.
The Heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at D.C. are well - conscious of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been hesitating to interfere with the disadvantage of the ambassador in the light of Gunters’ connection with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulties in following the orders of the Foreign Ministry in Washington, and he was said he refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for several months.
When he said he was going to work from his home in California unless he was ordered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Backward snippet
At last, the owner received the order, Gunter turned back to Iceland in May.
His new substitute, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their requests to the U.S. Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with CBS, or with DV inquiry.
Gunter is one of the many politically appointed ambassadors of the government of Trump, who have brought attention to unusual behavior in recent months.
For example, Woody Johnson caused a hard reaction when the day arrived that he was trying to make British open the Master’s Meeting in Golf on the Gulf of Trump’s Own.
The transmitter in South Africa has also been charged for driving his number two men and then trying to order her son to work.
42% of Ambassadors of the United States are politically appointed.
30% were politically assigned to Obama government, and 32% to George W. Bush.

Poland will inform itself of the European Convention on Prevention of Violence against Women
The Court of Justice of Poland says that the country will refrain from the European Convention to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal form of the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “shameful” as he requires schools to teach children about sex from social perspectives.
Ziobro said about the weekend that on Monday he would begin preparing the formal process of the country’s telling himself about the contract.
“This ideological aspect is related to the attempts to change education in schools and holiday work, to the study, attitude and conviction of younger generations of Poland, from the conclusion that our views are wrong, that biological sex is old - aged and that everything is really about social culture. ”
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the Agreement on education of children and young people as well as family relations in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT factor in the discussion of family relations, because this is the view held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the Council of Europe said that it was “awning” about Pole's dealing with the agreement.
On Friday, Warsaw protested about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, outside the offices of the right associations of Ordo Luris, who support the fact that the country shares the agreement.
“ We will not be victims, ” they called.
In other cities of Poland, there was also a protest.
In December 2012, Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and fight violence against women and domestic violence and completed it in 2015.

Good cholesterol, also called high - concentration fituprotine, collects “slave ” cholesterol — type of cholesterol that triggers the heart’s arteries — and brings it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low concentration fituprotine) is broken down into the liver and is then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not verify the dose size or type of chocolate used.
It is not clear whether the participants ate a dark chocolate, lactating chocolate or other cacoa.
The results were based on an elderly study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (as found in chocolate) reduced the risk of cardiac attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function means how well the blood spreads oxygens and nutrients across the body and transports waste materials.
Lifestyle factors were not reported in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had acknowledged chocolate eating were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stressed.
“Every of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys from books in a new collection admission campaign
“We have really listened, and there was a absolute key point in preparing the project,” said Ronson.
“ We don’t believe people want to rework the books – we think they’ll want them, but they can recover from their homes if they want it. ”
Ronson said that the new presentation campaign has been working long before COVID-19 came to history, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timetable for the new campaign has been “reached good ” because of the amount of time parents spend with their children now.
The reporters have explained anxiety because consumers have become tired of the increasing toy collection campaigns of the largest markets, but Ronson says no evidence of tiredness is seen yet.
“ We have not seen anything like this yet, but we have our eyes always open for this,” she said.
“ We discern very much data, from week to week, month to month, in order to ensure that what we leave is similar to our clients.
It was Cloes who rode the path for collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first about mid-2018 was the driving force behind the best annual fourth sale of the large market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the large market to increase its sales, and now last offers the environmental presentation campaign Discovery Garden customers on free plants and flowers for planting.
On the other hand, the new collection campaign could have less impact at this time, as UBS researchers predict an increase in sales in the largest part of the financial year 2021 in Australia.
Ronson said that clients can expect more diversity of collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be rarer.
“ There is a great deal of gathering campaigns throughout the world, ” she said, “and we are continually seeking inspiration from other countries. ”
“ We need to do so to make sure that we are increasingly dealing with our clients. ”
Prepared to go 5 rounds around the country in the summer
The photographer and material manufacturer John Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less on the flow of Iceland since the world epidemic.
John completed the basic business course at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but he is now working to travel and produce marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with Jonah, or April, when he traveled through the western coast and stayed in his car.
What last year is, he has gone around five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he has been on numerous day trips here and there.
What trip has it been?
“ For someone like me who is always on the door and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It is more weather and society that matters everything.
Recently, after their ways opened in June, they have gone far up to the highland.
Their trips always stand up because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possibly favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together at 5 large cars by the River Side and thereafter to the Alftawater."
What's your front in the summer?
“ It’s very exciting for me at the next time, but I was graduating with DIVE, and now I’m going to take up - to - date trips here and there.
Then I was adding a brimboard to the "dotasis" with me, so I'm getting more out of the sea than before.
So I'm going on a 10-day "solo" trip with everything I need my back, but it'll appear later in summer where I'm going.
Otherwise, I'm going to be very high in the neighborhood, because it's not possible to look at that area all year."
What place in Iceland is in your favorite place?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but Jack’s bill has been a part of my life since I remember.
My family and I went every summer in a dwelling place at the roots of a Breather’s yoke, and then I’ve always felt well in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've come there over 100 times."
Where do you recommend visiting people in Iceland?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it’s: the Mulags in the South, the Balance in the East, the Aldeyarfoss in the North, the Red Sand in the West, the Snake Snake in the West, and the last but not the last...
What is essential in the journey?
“ I’m not going to land unless I have the following in the car: Good pocket light, hanging room, lobpapeysa, hunting knife, a granule, a refrigerator, and awesome bites... those who know me know what I'm talking about. ”
Searched for 24 rods that are afraid to have drowned from the island of Malachi
KUALA LUMPUR, Malachi (AP) — On Sunday, the authorities of Malaya said that 25 calcium refugees were searched, fearing to be drunk after they stuck off a boat from the Langkawi island, north of Malachi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high official in Malachi, said that the first information from the police showed that only one of the 25 calm men who had stuck off the boat had reached swimming to the country.
According to Zawawi, the man who survived, the police were seeking assistance late Saturday and has been held while the case was examined closer.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Myanmar for military operations, and many of them live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the inhabitants of Malachi, who have been a time of destination for boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said two ships and airlines were used to search.
He said that the land sanctuary will also make sailors in the area and the authorities of the neighbouring country of Thailand informed so that they can assist in the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities of Malachi held 269 calm - refugees and found bodies on board a boat suspected of being used for smuggling from the coasts of Langkawi, who claimed that he had been injured willingly so that he could not go back to the sea.
Malachi’s Holiness later said that the 269 individuals had been transferred from a larger ship with tens of people believed to have died and their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malachi could not accept more calcium refugees because of the chronic era.
However, he said that those already in the land would not be sent back to the sea.
In Malachi, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as about 180,000 refugees and refugee leaders — including 106,000 calms — are registered at the United Nations Refugee Organization.
Inhabitants of Aswan collect, guard, and return a farm of chocolate to Sudan after a motorcycle
On Sunday, at the gates of the village of Wadi Karkar, the driver fell into a coma for a hit.
Inhabitants grouped to assist the driver where he was lying and saving the product that had been produced.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver was “away by our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We should help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the car driver, and then tried to save the car’s farm, estimated at three million pounds of Egypt.
Bahr said that villagers have been in the area from morning to evening and have saved as much of the farm as they could.
“ What was most important to us was to save the driver’s life, protect the farm, and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to give the damaged driver water and a shelter, said Bahr, adding that they would simply ensure that he would come to and from the village safe.
The chronic virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone is a call to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in difficult times, ” says a report made by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also faced with other debts that are about the inheritance of our nation and the race unequality that has destroyed our country from its foundation. ”
The study reviews known substances related to the embarrassing situation of the Assembly: lack of real links between groups, a timetable which limits the opportunity to communicate, too much compression of authority in leaderships, constant funding requirements, assessments of cooperation between groups, negative effects on the media that operates throughout the day, then the fact that the most important elections for the congregators are often foregoing and final silence of minorities.
It is also warned that the Congress moves more to the network homes due to the world epidemic, where such a system, which allows elections by means of the republics of the Representative Department without the need to travel to Washington, could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote meeting reaches its footing, it would be a serious relapse for attempts to increase the interaction between classes, as the report states.
“ The world epidemic was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the Congress needs “more than no less communication between the Senators, face to face. ”
They need to study each other's area better, have courteous discussions to find a common spot and build a link based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly true in the week, when Ted Yoho, Senator of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, the Senator of Democrats from New York, with events and his companions in the Rebublikana group, to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republics of Wyoming with hostile words.
Ms. Val Demings talks about the Vice-President's office, tells Trump to hear it for gratification
The democrat Val Demings (Florida) was not ashamed of discussing her interest in the post of the Vice-President in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the group of blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a direct broadcast because of #FIYAH! The Live program and told about its history, agency and commitment that has brought her to the place she is at today, and began with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of worker and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Deputy Assembly in the trials of Donald Trump in the elderly department in January.
Regardless of whether the elderly branch defeats Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth President who is accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the Responsive Assembly said, “Is this worth it, and it has been worth it every day.”
She added that even though the decision had been disappointed, the democratics had been obliged to follow the matter after its outcome.
In the interview, Demings clearly stated that it is a counterfeiting of Trump at Roger Stone’s prison sentence, who was sentenced for lying before the Congress (also other crimes) as well as his grace to other criminals who were convicted for similar crimes, when she said, “The blamelessness of reaching your friends, those who have lied and deceived to cover your wrongdoings. ”
Deamings is the top of the list of possible procurement agents to the vice-president Joe Biden, which also holds President Karen Bass CBC (Democrates, California), Stacey Abram’s former parliamentary of Georgia, the Senators of Camal Harris (Democrates, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Demorates, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms CEO Atlanta, Susan Rice former consignor of the United States, and some others.
However, she argued that only one person would decide who would offer Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she brought her hand to her mouth while she laughed and felt whispering at those who looked at the direct broadcast, and added, "If you want to call... then you can do that for me."
There is no doubt that regardless of each’s political views, history books regard this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This wasn't past Demings.
It noted that the number of women that are present to the Deputy President of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ That’s exactly the opportunity I’m working so hard that all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of wrong sex, ” she said.
The congregation decided to ensure that the democratic committee and the Biden election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to make as many as possible to choose as possible.
“I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Committee) and I will put this on the top of my list,” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election campaign.
When she answered the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his elections, and another editorial article that says that the President is preparing to reach himself survived over Demings: “As much as it is up to reach himself, I was dismayed. ”
“ But who would ever do it different from Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the governance record in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't lose.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with them who let it happen."
Footing bottles for children
There are bottles for children who want to swallow with their parents from young age in bottles that fit the dinner in better days.
No doubt there are some parents now who rejoice — or the parents who have been led to children’s chocolates with decorative pictures.
However, the children are asking for their parents ’ glasses as well, for they feel more excited to see their feet.
These discussed bottles were found on the page modernhouseessentials.com, which stores various golden moles.
The glasses have a good steam, stable foot, and suffer well heat - so children can enjoy the soap whether it is hot or cold.
Each bottle is approximately 150 ml.
Those who want to look at the bottles can look into the HEE home page, but the bottles are offered in this day, at a small dollar of SEK 3,000.
Alibaba and Jack Ma were envoyed in Gurugram for the dear former employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been envoyed in Gurugram after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been dismissed for protesting the documentation and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is taken in the Gurugram District Court, and the Private Judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a course for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others and asked them to come to justice on July 29, according to the news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram, October 2017, is at 268,000 American dollars in damage improvements according to judicial documents.
“We stand with the company’s commitments to the Indian market and the welfare of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with national laws.
We cannot express ourselves on the present case," said UC India in announcement.
The "list of vulnerable words" contains the passwords of Hindi and English, such as "India and China borders" and "the war between China and India", which is stated in the claim that UC Web uses the text on its systems in India, says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of Industry banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browsers, with increased tension between the two countries.
Representative of New York City's Fireplace says it's absolutely okay to exclude a white firefighter from honour
A representative who has the issue of multiplying in New York City's fireplace says it's "complete" to keep a white firefighter from honour so that flag berries can all be black, according to a new news.
The white firefighter Daniel McWilliams has appealed to the disparity of race after he was removed from the group of flagberries at the Memorial Mass in November 2017 to remember the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firefighters.
In addition, the chief deputy in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Department of Human Rights, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three volunteers of the Department, who, on a historical picture, sees the elevated American flags at the ground Zero in the days after the attacks of 11 September.
According to McWilliam’s Deputy Department, he had chosen to be alone to the flagers in honor at the Memorial Event.
To be a flager at this ceremony was a “great honor and privilege” for McWilliam, as shown in the CNN prosecution.
However, when he arrived at the ceremony, he was prevented from taking part in the honor of the dawn president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because, as it was claimed, she had asked for all flag berries at the mess to be black.
She then asked McWilliam – a 29-year-old employee of the New York City firefire – to help in another way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do, it is to accompany unchanged civilians and set up qualified firefighters from the mess.
McWilliams claimed in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honour because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has worked at the firefire of New York City for 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he abandoned the Memorial “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and coworkers heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When the Black Loving witnessed to the court, McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So praying for all to be black in honor is not a difference? ”
“ No, it isn’t, ” said Loving, according to New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask for everyone to be black in honour, who she replied: “Absolutely. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person to “high up our speciality and different origins to create pride, consensus, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first lodged a complaint on the difference from the race in the New York City firehouse in January 2018.
He then made a case against Wilson, the firefire of New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams made his charges, his supporters would have revenged Wilson and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put hands on McWilliam and said: “I have heard of you, they told me you would be like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In an excavation, Sullivan wrote that excluding McWilliam’s honour at the mess would have been “awkward ” and evidence that one thing was not valid at all at the firefire.
“ If you are a black person and differs from a white person at the workplace, you will mostly be reminded, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson, according to the lawyer, received a "consultation for one hour" for her treatment with McWilliam.
In the meantime, a white person who differs from a black person “extremely punishment,” Sullivan wrote.
“The closure of New York City has created a policy and process that is intended to please the members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist manner, excuse their actions and helpers ... and this must stop,” wrote Sullivan, too.
Terrorized a walking roadman and demanded money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery, threatening a walking roadman and trying to get money from the person.
The man was stored in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the city center.
The knife was made up and recorded from the person.
More than eighties cases arrived on the board of the police in the capital area from 17 to 05, and this morning six were stored in a prison cell.
Police stopped, among other things, the driver of a car that drove a bike at the Chalarnese, where the bicycle equipment was in a very bad state.
The wheelhouse was stayed and was intended to provide a transporter to transfer it to the city.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the Years.
Two were arrested for the matter and were released after the final reporting.
There was also an announcement of individuals who shot firefires in the Years.
They had escaped when the police came to the place, “likely they were aware of the shame where there was still a considerable long time in the years. ”
Thousands of inhabitants of Khabarovsk still require the resignation of Putin
Thousands of citizens of the city of Khabarovsk joined the Russian city yesterday and protested the arrest of the district manager in the council south of Eastern Russia and the installation of his successors, who have never lived in the region.
The former district manager, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity, and tens of thousands of city inhabitants protested when he was arrested and sent to the preservative in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering murders of three cooperatives 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally appointed as the district manager and his 39 - year - old group brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, to his place, with little impression of the inhabitants.
When Degtaryev was said unexperienced and, worse than that, without any connection with Khabarovsk, he called the city’s people the most prompt.
They've called Degtaryev as a wind around the ears.
Yesterday, protesters were smaller than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the statement of the President of the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
“We want the governor to be released, because we are very likely that his arrests are illegal,” says the AFP newsroom after half thirty-three protesters, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that Kremlar’s agents had arrested Furgal “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the region. ”
The police in Khabarovsk made Protestants unreasonable, even though the circumstance was a strict breach of the circumstance of the chronic virus age.
However, in Moscow, the police arrested at least ten people who met at Pushkin Tower to show Protestants in Khabarovsk support in work, says the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's group, Russia's Freely Democratic Group, is a group of strict nationalists, and is considered to be somewhat loyal to the Crimean Government in most matters.
The same political reporters, however, inform BBC, that Furgal’s victory in the district leaderial elections two years ago — great and unambiguous — had been a huge attack for Putine and the United Russia, and even though it indicates that the Kreamle’s eastern region was getting sick.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is waiting for a trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in the years 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were made: but the third went out of the dust.
Sarah Rainsford, reporter BBC, in Moscow, says Furgal’s followers, who enjoy great popular homes, convinced that the accusation and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his defeat.

Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large covid infectious area in Chennai, where there have been approximately 10,000 cases.
Workday begins early at 7:30, and ends at 4:00.
It measures the temperature of the inhabitants, asks about symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to the diagnosis and treatment of infection at a time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of the 16,000 employees of Chennai City who care for home skims but are not healthcare professionals.
The project, according to the authorities, has contributed to the reduction of positive cases by 50 percent, in Chennai daily, while increasing in other provinces of Tamil Nada.
Shanthi says that not all of the people are cooperative.
She adds: “The majority of people are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
However, some will be irritated.
However, this is not a matter of concern.
I think people should be safe.
When I get back the next day, the people are courtesy.
It helps build up a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the hospital of the city for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19 teams.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also disabled, has also participated in the mission as a supervisor.
Though Kavitha has a specially prepared bike, she goes to meet people and keeps on her hooks.
“ I’m happy, ” she says, “but I want to see them go down to perhaps about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
At the first height of the hostage where they two live, Matilda Funceca, basketballtagona that uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data from about 40 women into the Chennai city web server.
Matilda does not say that he is afraid to be infected by the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
As Manimekalai is asked what she does, she says: “I use a mask, keep away, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that increases the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women used their time and ability to clean masks for healthcare professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the governor of the hostage, and the Dorcas Institute, who runs the cloud, say: “They are adapting to the needs at any time.
Before they needed masks, they did not leave their own.
Now it is time to intervene in the community, and they answered the call."
After the last day of 6989 new cases of chronic virus infection in Tamil Nadu, the largest number of infectious substances that are reported on one day, according to official data, are now 200,000.
Eighty and nine have died and 7758 have recovered over the last day.
The total number of infectious substances in the state is now 206.737.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of disparity
The last few weeks have realized that many bones are still in the closet in relation to race rights in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to take place and take action to ensure that everyone is welcome to sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former croquet star of Proteas, made it to his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying he and other black teams are “awards. ”
Prince said that the black players of Protea have been officially called “kvote players ” by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada were still at the top of sports, some people were still linked to the quota discussion.
Prince, who is now the trainer of Cape Cobras team, sent this statement to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday evening.
The objective of the consensus is to continue the fireful discussion of historical race rights in South African sports.
“ As I said when I lighted up in social media, it is not my intention to come and draw people’s names into the field, but these are real events...
"You're doing all right, but you're still getting infected."
Paul Roberts, former musician and engineer who became NASA’s developer, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, the former nurse at the Methodist Hospital, who viewed himself as an optimist, kept an interesting journal on the Internet, and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they pump with two of their daughters, their relative sons and 7-year-old grandchildren and play a huge Uno-game.
“ They’re incredible norths, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the world epidemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that may increase its risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a bone that keeps the previously stiff corneal seed open.
“ We have been so careful, very careful, and keep us away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working home in the spring, when the epidemic struck hard on Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has made a large deal in “the old age, ” and, according to Sheryl, their only real date over the past few months was when they began to look at wild flowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then, one day in mid - June, she came home from work and thought she was allergic.
Soon she received cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and scent sense, which are typical symptoms of the crown virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what is happening, Mother, but I had a mask, washing my hands,” said Sheryl.
"You do everything right, but you get infected anyway."
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with a positive chronic virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse in her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began kidneying, and then coughing, just as their daughter, and then got warm and great pain in the body.
Sheryl Roberts said: “He became very sick, very disciplined quickly.
June 22, he became confused.
She carefully checked his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to emergency, for the second time in two days.
According to a new book, the kingly couple felt that it was “ignored ” in the Queen’s Christmas talk
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, British Queen, have “ignored” them in their Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were overlooked by those in the library that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk that the queen sat at, among other things, showed the Vilhelm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl British Prince, and his wife Kamilla as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry weren’t seeing anywhere despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “power of grandchildren. ”
The new book, published in August, also shows that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends, ” as they“ struggled to overcome superior courtesy ” and met only several times.
Yesterday, Harry and his brother Willhelm were claimed to have started some years before his relationship with Meghan, but it reached a peak because of Vilhelm and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “warning sheep ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, so it is said that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history. ”
The Congregations of the Congregation accuse the work leaders of wanting to keep officials “live forever. ”
The Congregations of the Congregation accuse the work leaders of wanting officials to be “forever homes, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Deputy officers were accused of wanting employees to “speak forever at home ” after they protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
The Congregations of the CEO were angry when a public and general union told their colleagues to wonder when their supervisors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said “unacceptable” that the need for public service, such as the edition of passports, would be a stop while public - market employees would have worked hard to keep society running during the chronic virus age.
“ It is unacceptable that people refused to return to their jobs while employees in stores and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that officials could eat while this has been done, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on summer vacation but can’t do so because of the people who refuse to return to their workplaces, even though they are safe.
Commanders cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now when we know people can return to work safely."
Following a call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed business manager of public service, announced that the board “did turn away from officials in public service from their homes, and quickly return to their workplaces until August 1.”
The work community of officials and general employees expressed their associates, who consider about 200,000 people, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, and said that this was about politics.
A spokesman of the work community of officials and general employees, the largest worker community of officials in the United Kingdom, said that the requirement to return to the workplace was “not made up with the health and safety of our social partners in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done solely because of political pressure from the Congregations of the Congregation, which requires public service to be used as an example to bring others back to work.
Our recommendations to the social partners are clear: If you do your jobs at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it as of course that you have to do so."
The dispute can be caused by increasing dissatisfaction with late passports because employees work at home, but about 400,000 people are now said to wait for their application.
The Intergovernmental Ministry has now issued that it will “use to accelerate” applications from the United Kingdom for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have waited for a passport for more than four weeks.
The public and public staff agency has acknowledged that some have had to wait for up to 143 days for passports, but claims that “small and often narrow offices ” make 4000 employees of the passport service difficult for weeks to keep the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of the workmates to “have themselves wise ” and seek ways to cooperate with governments to bring people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a work officer: “What is it you want?
However, many of the largest companies in Britain have ignored Johnson’s recommendations to people to return to work.
A study of larger jobs with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important part of satisfaction
Gift has grown, but understanding and sinfulness should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this knowledge and understanding shortage.
Too little is taught by a passionate history.
The fact is that without a rotary action, the only lesson that deals specifically with our history – “Saga Australia” for the 12th grade – will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria graduated in Australia’s history of 49.324 who completed primary school, or only 1%.
Over the last six years, these figures have almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 less students registered each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th class is that in the previous years of study little has been done to stimulate their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “consciousness. ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grade only one short unit on the "inhabitants and the island of Torres and their culture".
In the 9th and 10th year, Australia is another unit in the world wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during the primary school years.
In the 9th and 10th year, the second optional unit is between 1750 and 1918.
It is urgent to take three actions to save the Australian history in Victoria’s schools.
First, history needs to become an independent study article, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only felt as part of intellectual science, it gets little space in the study record.
It is usually taught by people who have general education in intellectual science but have not learned in history.
Historic skills such as analysis of information are complex.
We need more specialist historian scholars to make sure that such skills are available and exciting.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 must become a duty.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, because they would have had to learn the material from the ground.
Knowledge of the history alone and seeing bridges are not deeply interracial.
But without it, as explained in Victoria’s study program, the mission is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a parliamentary member of Viktoria's Congress and former assistive school manager Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aron Elis in the final game of the European Site - Isaki divided by a half-game game
Aaron Eli’s Third Son is at the end of the European seat in the Danish Decorative Division of Football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half game with the Nordrköping team against Falkenberg’s bottom team in Sweden.
Aaron Eliz was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team went on to a final game of seat in the precursorship of the European Department.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, which depends on whether the joints end up after the final turning after the top part of the Danish selection department later today.
Aaron Elis played the entire game in 1-1 matches with Horsens on the outskirts today when OB had won the first game of the teams at home, 3-1, and thus won a single 4-2.
Isaac was a member of the Norrköping team, which was expected to be 2-0 below the first half of the Falkenberg bottom team in the Swedish decoration department.
At the beginning of a second half game, the North Creation made a threefold division, and Isaac was one of those who had to violate.
Norrköping achieved equal value, but Falkenberg arrived at 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
However, it was still time for Norrköping to balance from hell in the last minute, 3-3.
North Creation continues at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elf City, and five points before Malmö, which is a game for good later today.
The step helped Falkenberg to get away from the bottom in a while, but the team is a step above Helsingstad and Kalmar, who have a game for good.

There is also a burning of a Fire Flag that is burned each year.
“ I think many are excited to get burned on Friday evening.

“ It will be burned in this burn, but it just needs to show how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrés be mentioned in new documents on sexual fraud?
The British king family is now preparing for responding to possible new information in legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
The United States Judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among the things found in these 80 pages of documents are parts of Maxwell’s witness from 2016
The display of this late could also put a great pressure on Prince Andrés, where they find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, meant by the dishonored American financialman, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to communicate with Prince André.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information during the week with even harmfuler accusations of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his meant mind, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered this week the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The expression of these huge large documents would be a shame for the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have large parts of their witnessing before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “general questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés, where one document contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, referring to the sex slave of the dishonored American financer, claimed in 2015 in legal documents that it had been forced three times to communicate with Andrew.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected these claims.
E-mail from 2015 that has been leaked and BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell to respond to Robert’s claims.
There is no doubt that the Duke will be rebelled
There he said to the superior woman: “Let me know when we can talk, and there are certain questions that I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell answered: “There's information, call me when you have a free time. ”
Last night, a writer near Andrew said: “The Duke of Jordan has not done anything wrong, so we are not worried about opening the court documents.
As courts in the United States have made their efforts to point them out, this does not mean that a accusation is true, even though it appears in court documents.
U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the treatment of accusations found in legal documents.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in a preservation centre in Manhattan and is waiting for trials to find and deceive some of Epstein’s victims under law from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of harmfulness for refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last discussed with lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s injurious head, who now is under the surname Giuffre, which she took up after a marriage.
About 40 pages of the total of 418 witnesses were made public last year, but after Judge Presna’s decision in New York last week, more items could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to submit an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was in charge of sexual fraud.
Research police are looking for crimes for violent attacks on Edinburgh’s streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him an injury that could prove to be permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious damage.
Investigator Dale Miles, director of the study, said: “This was a violent and reasonless attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be 40 years old, about 180 cm high and strongly grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white bowl, dark pants and dark shoes.
Miles Detective said: “I ask everyone in this area when the attack was done and I saw something suspicious about giving up. ”
The messenger wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States in Iceland, wants to carry a gun here in the country and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “sick ” about his security since he came to the country last year.
This is seen in the CBS news, which also says that this will, despite his work in “a safest kingdom in the world. ”
It is said that Gunter asked the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hide after the Israeli government to carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a trunked car and a western car that protects him from knifes.
However, sources of CBS say that Gunter has repeatedly reported that he is not at risk in Iceland.
CBS reports that Iceland’s Foreign Ministry did not provide information about whether a request was made from the United States for the possible weapons performance of Gunter, because the authorities did not express the security measures of foreign agents.
The sources of the newsletter say that no request was made.
Then, too, CBS, after its authors had been told that Gunter should not seek weapons, so it would be taken as an insult here in the country.
Gunter is experienceless as an aristocracy, who has for years been a disease doctor in California.
He is active in the Republican Group of the United States and an active supporter, President Donald Trump.
He recently raised attention here in the country when he spoke of “the invisible virus of China. ”
Authors of the CBS also say that Gunter was very deeply affected by the U.S. Ambassador of Reykjavík.
He already had seven next - standing staff in the ambassador from May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the “Devil, ” called the network of American officials who work against Trump, and reacted angry with the fact that one brought snow into his office.
The missionary traveled to Washington DC in February before a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter said he wanted to work from California, but at the end, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The world game form is a key point for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when the fans can come back
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the selection department started again, but he says that much easier it would be to maintain good luck at home if the spectators were launched to play.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six joints above has lost more at home.
The coach of Portuguese said that even if such triumphs were possible without the followers, if they were there, it would be easier to maintain it.
“ We have to do this with the fans, and without them there can be some kind of activity, where the play plan is in the forefront,” he said.
“ But I think that it is much more powerful to do so with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game, which is next only with the help of fans at the home scene, is added. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is increasingly difficult to maintain the long victory periods in the homes he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up in the past three seasons.
But this is also a key element in determining whether the past achieves their goals at the end of the period, especially in matching games and neighborhoods, where the atmosphere in the field can divide.
“ I believe that the policy of the decorative department is now being increasingly difficult to make this unwhole assessment, because of what has been done good. ”
“ It is important, however, to be strong at home and to have at the end of the season, a number of stages with victories in home games. ”
“ I’m pleased with my home games in the past, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I can see a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
This is a sympathy that is built up a little and a little."
Buyers excited for desired lifestyle properties in Lovely Banks
"Larger is better," is evidently the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the vicinity of Lovely Banks, which was recently sold at a dollar of 1270.
Interesting buyers looking for lifestyle property near the centre of Geelong were shocked to examine this 1,35 hectare land, where there is a car park for 14 cars, swimming pools and views of the Corio River.
Joe Gregic, a real estate dealer in Harcourts, Northern Geelong, said that the country property offered that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its marketing.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home for isolation
“ We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Gregic.
“ The property was sold to a very excited homeman. ”
The property is accompanied by four rooms on two heights, including a special bathroom that is large enough to bed.
The new owners have three rooms, and they can take advantage of the kitchen and refresh the area with a view to the pool.
“ It was in the way the property was composed, that it was three yards, and that she was in this place,” said Gregic.
“ There came interested buyers from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the midst of the area, but still with a landmark.
“ I have people who missed and buyers who are still looking. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double carcases and a free-standing cloud of more than 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrials or to store a bike and trailer.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed to the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been hypocritical about his security since he arrived in Reykjavík last year. ”
This is how the detailed report of CBS News on the U.S. Ambassador in Iceland begins, which emulates numerous sources of CBS from the United States' foreign service.
The CBS report claims that Gunter wished at the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he would be given special permission by the Icelandic governments to carry weapons.
He should also have desired a breast - guarded car, along with ideas about the west that could protect him from knife attacks.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to publicly state whether Gunter’s security is really threatened in Iceland, but, according to officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite the recently advertised U.S. embassy in Iceland after full - time care, including in the morning newspaper of July 18, but the CBS records suggest that it is done to sleep Gunter’s concerns.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express specific security operations related to its ambassador, but it always states the objective of safeguarding security in preventive ways.
The Council does not answer questions concerning Gunter’s request for arms, and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not want to say whether the United States formally wanted the Ambassador to carry weapons, and is usually not expressing itself on security issues of foreign post offices.
However, the CBS, according to its English sources, has never submitted the request for this subject, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was given from these plans, which could infringe the residents in Iceland.
The CBS report also discusses the various problems that have been the admissible U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed an ambassador in the last year, but he will already have replaced his spare master seven times.
Thus, the first beneficiary is said to have long prepared for his work and learned English only to have been denied in the last hour because Gunter “does not find him ” at their first meeting.
His followers have not been much better under Gunter’s control.
Governments of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position in the Icelandic embassy, but are reluctant to intervene in matters linked to the President.
In addition to all these, Gunter is said to be tough to follow the various rules of foreign service and respect the order of authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in Washington conference, and it is said that he refused to return to Iceland afterwards and left his temporary replacement for his work for months, and in the midst of the world.
Will Gunter have even desired to carry out his job at a distance, and he said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, wanted it specifically.
According to information from the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take his personal permission at the end of the conference and the crown virus age delayed further, but according to the CBS accounts, many of the governments would have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not until May, following Pompeo had contact with him and would be pleased to return to the Iceland embassy.
The CBS report also reports of Gunter’s enmity in Iceland, in particular in connection with a tie calling the chronic virus “invisible Chinese virus” and has received a lot of criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced in the field of foreign service as an ambassadors who have been appointed in the Governance of the President of the United States of Donald Trump.
The case Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata group says a government crisis in the state; the Congress group wants a vote.
Ashok Gehlot said that if it was necessary, the Congress group would have to resort to a seat protest outside the home of a Prime Minister.
On Saturday, after peaceful contests with Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said that if it was necessary for the Congress group to meet the President, and to be used for condemnations outside the home of the Prime Minister, the crises of the State would be necessary to bring the crises to success.
At the meetings of the Congress group, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote fee to check whether the majority of the congregators and congregators were with him in the power struggle.
“ He said that the government had the majority and would like to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the Head of the Congress Group, after the meeting.
The assembly was held at a hotel, where the Senators who support Gehlot have held themselves for the last few days.
“ The Minister asked us to be ready to stay longer at the hotel.
If it would be necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of a Prime Minister," said a group leader.
Prime Minister Rajasthan may convey the Congress group to show its majority, said the group leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and suggested that the Bharatiya Janata group’s counsel had come up to steady the government of Ashok Gehlot of a chair.
“ The country is now governed by law and governance.
Kingdom governments are formed and operate with the people’s authority.
Bharatiya Janata’s counsel has come up with the government of Rajasthan from a chair.
This is an insult to 80 million inhabitants of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must convene the Congress to bring the truth ahead of the country," said Gandhi in a tie of Hindi.
On Saturday, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said to the Congress Group that he was ready to go to the meeting of the Indian president to ensure that what he calls “Raadbrugg Bharatiya Janata ” in order to suspend for a reliable declaration by a vote fee is not possible.
Golot, who protested for several hours with the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to push to a conference, met with the Congress and government congress members on Saturday, and after the meeting, new suggestions were made and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot to return the assembly request last night and pointed to six contests.
It will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying for the assembly where he is “under pressure ” to suspend the vote fee that reduces trust in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata missionary committee in the leadership of the Satish Poonia and the leader of the Governorial Resistance Gulab Chandra Kataria with the governor to discuss the status of COVID-19 in the State.

The player Spencer Grammer is given a surveillance outside the restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK – The playster Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm down the angry man when he cut her arm and put her friend in her back outside the restaurant in New York last Friday.
Grammer, a 36 - year - old, said the US Weekly that she and her friend had done what all others had done in the same circumstances as they had tried to prevent the worsening of the situation when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the outskirts of The Black Ant in the East Village area of Manhattan at 23:30 a.m.
On Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded that he be paid, and the restaurant was closed.
Grammer and her friend were hurt when they tried to “resolve disputes between an unknown man and other local guests, ” according to the police.
The man ran away after he had wounded Grammer’s right arm and stuck her friend into the moisture with an unknown odd-wave object, said the police.
No one has been arrested.

In an explanation to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded to the Bellevue Hospital, who responded to them and mentioned the “wonderful fight” of these employees with the chronic virus age.
“ It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them personally, ” said Grammer.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now called the next star UFC after registering in the Fight Island history, but he does not say he's going to flag his wealth in a shameful way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev wore a superpower of Northern Irish Rhys McKee in their struggle in the abu Dabi on Saturday night when he victoryed his competitor when three minutes and nine seconds had passed from the first cycle by having the hit on him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in the history book UFC for the shortest time between victory in the modern history, where only 10 days had passed since he conquered Britain John Phillips in a similarly decisive manner, then in between.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 American dollars for the performance of the evening against McKee and has taken the attention of the MMA world so fully that it is now called "Khalib 2.0", which is said to be inevitable comparison because of the probability between the superior Chimaev and the UFC master in light and where he is born in Tétonia, which is close to the homes of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newly found famous and financial benefits, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not be grateful to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his companion in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I do this not just for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has noted Conor McGregor's team and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social note that he could “simplely” victory Chimaev with a passover.
It was not on a poisoned answer from the fighter who is under the name “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native technician language, who said that he would“ paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the 19 - year - old country, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is evidently unable to dress his fighting ability.
“I can paint anybody...
How many fighters are in the Velvety Division?
I can paint them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of masters, 84 kilos of masters (milligrams), I'll paint them both, the same day. ”
The Israelites continue to oppose the reaction of Prime Ministers to the world epidemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — thousands of Israelites protested against the Prime Ministers in many parts of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official office of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The contest has lasted for a few weeks, because critics believe that the government’s neglect should react to the chronic virus age after they have managed to maintain the threat of the virus at the outset.
Prosecution against Netanyahu for corruption has further pushed the protests.
“ Bib, go home, ” said on a sign of one of the Protestants.
On the other map, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants were also assembled outside the Netanyahu beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
Following the so-called rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The country’s economy has been struck due to the limitations caused by the virus and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
Contesters say that the government’s financial assistance is not near enough.
The protest took place in the shadow of the courts of corruption accusations against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearing starts in January.
He is accused of betrayal, confidentiality, and mutuality in a series of disaster languages.
Hundreds of Protestants gather in the city of Los Angeles to show consensus with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 Protestants met in the city of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon for supporting two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where the attention was focused on federal police on conflicts with Protestants.
Similar protest meetings were held throughout the United States, including in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protest in Los Angeles was organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The group went to the headquarters of the police in Los Angeles at First Street and Main Street and then to the preservative center of the large - city area.
The participants also moved to the Alameda River at Road 101 but left it later.
Parts of the people saw broken windows in federal buildings in central towns, and words were written on federal marks.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people multidata targets in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The Festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31th and August 1st.
The Government of Karnataka has published that only 50 may be gathered in mosques for prayers for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other sites due to the chronic virus age.
Guests who want to pray for in mosques must have masks and keep away, according to the order from AB Ibrahim, Ministry Manager of Minorities and Wakf.
The order shows that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha feast, also called Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts, but on 1 August, elsewhere in the country.
In the order, although prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be prohibited due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers, however, will be allowed in mosques to give no more than 50 parts of one.
If there are more than one time of prayer, the Ministry of the Order says.
Prayer meetings should not be held anywhere else, such as meeting houses, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal, ” as is seen.
The Carnataka Government allows the opening of the temples, mosques and other places of prayer to those who want to pray from 8 June, given that the protection of infectious substances is well protected by COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador wants a armed lifeguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Ambassador of the United States in Iceland, believes his life is threatened in a country and wants to have weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. ambassador replicated after the bodyguards in the Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertising.
According to Kveik’s accounts, the main reason that these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter considers his life threatened in Iceland.
Fires have discussed with the sources of Iceland and foreign people who have convinced the ambassadors that he is in great danger, and the reason is that he is a Jewish tribe.
Each threat is not as clear, but Kiek’s commentators said that Islamic terrorists were called threats.
The CBS television station discussed the issue on its web this morning, and according to the authors of Washington, Gunter is mad for persecution, demands to carry weapons itself, to have a stainless west and armed beams alongside a fire - resistant car.
According to CBS, Gunter has been repeated that there is no threat and that the “bodyguard” advertising is only for sleeping Gunter.
According to Kveik’s records, the stations had not been established in June, but the application report was completed in February.
According to Kveik’s sources, for these changes, there has not been a formal issue from the United States Mission.

A radioman in Seattle who shocked Trump's reaction to protests say now needs to get a gun after Starbucks coffee house below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new view of violent protests after heavily accused of President Donald Trump of the United States in June to say that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed was that the crush was closer to the share manager’s home.
“I feel like I need to buy me a weapon because this will obviously continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that damages had “devastated” the Starbucks coffee house at the bottom of his multitude.
"Now it's enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me, very angry now."
It was different when Trump complained last month that CEO of Seattle would allow the city to be taken over by violent Protestants.
“ These freely democratics are clear, ” said the president.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a member of the “Danny & Gallant ” part of the ESPN collaborative radio station in Seattle, replied:“ Go through there by curiosity last night and see no burning, robbery, or death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building, where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffee house.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Goodly done, you idiots, ” and said that he had also seen fire from a few distances.
“I don’t know what's going on, but we're gonna find out. ”
The rotation did not pass by people who were ridiculed to Gallant for his previous opinion and sent messages like “Slap on lax” and “Jah, maybe Trump had right for himself.”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “If we don’t eventually go on this tour we were discussing. ”
Gallant laughed: “Awakened and saw that a lot of people were cheating on the lax to me. I laughed. ”
He said he was standing at his previous claim as he had walked through the CHAZ self-regulation area of anarchy and although it wasn't as bad as it would have been executed as.
"Then they were burned and robbed after all," he said.

Counts too early to claim another wave here in the country
A psychiatric expert at the agricultural department says too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were diagnosed at the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday and have been infected by thousands of people.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, in men aged 30 and the other in a 20 - year - old man.
Since the beginning of the month, nothing had been detected.
Yesterday, there were three other domestic infections, one of which had been at the Rey Cup, Laugardal.
John K. Johnsson, a government police officer’s information officer, said in a conversation with a newsroom that fewer had to take a show because of the contamination that was originally considered.
The second infection is in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15th.
At that time, the rules for so - called home - in - law had been valid.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus daughter, a psychiatric expert at the Agricultural Association, says, however, that the person followed the old process.
The show with him was negative when it came to the land, and then he became sick, in isolation, and six have been infected.
They are all on the way to showing, but two of them have started to show symptoms.
The third infection has been associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been placed in an infectious state.
It has been shown that there is a new variation of the crown virus that has not previously been identified here in the country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He that was believed to have brought the virus to the land had been in Israel, and in other countries of Europe."
It believes too early to claim that the so-called second wave of the epidemic has gone out in this country, just as other European countries are afraid.
“ As long as the majority are still drivable, it is not tablefitting.
But we are on our teeth, and we are watching, thinking of ways to fail if something like that might go away."
Megan Fox Pronounces His Relationship
Megan Fox said he found his twin soul in the rappara Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
I'm interested in star marks, and at the same time I knew that my twin soul was about it,” says Fox, 34 years old.
“ The twin - soul is when the soul has reached a sufficient level of existence to divide it into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ We are, therefore, two helmets of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it immediately."
“ When we had known for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the starmarks and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same string, but they met a movie.
“ I was hanging outside her bike house and hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months since Fox divorced his husband to ten years old, Brian Austin Green.

Increased difficulty in protests against racial rights in the United States
Protestants have walked through streets of cities in the United States to draw attention to race rights.
Contests have passed for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd killed a police arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police to Portland, and thereby still under the protests.
Contesters are now also opposed to the city’s federal police officers.
On Saturday, in Seattle, police used bombs and tears and arrested 45 people, after protest meetings to support the protests in Portland were dissolved in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 policemen were hurt.
One of them died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was launched into the Black Live Matter requirement.
Sources of the media say that the man could have walked up to a car with a gun before he was shot.
“ The essence of the matter is that it is terrible that someone should let go of protests, ” stated Steve Adler, CEO of Austin.
Adler claimed to be “shame beaten and without word.”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor’s case, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
The boyfriend Taylor had first shot to the police, because he thought they were infringement thieves.
One policeman has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other policemen haven't been accused.
The president of the NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the police investigation on the murder of Taylor.
According to police information, three members of NFAC were injured on Saturday when shots ran from an accident of weapons from the rebellion army.
Potential group infection in sealing
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infections this week outside the border.
Two of them were infected with previously unseen variants of the virus, and the origin of three out of five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals were infected by a tourist who has returned from the country or the unidentified Icelander, who likely infected much more.
The local pharmacist says that a potential group infection may be sealing in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with the type of virus.
The origin of infections is still unclear.
So, three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country on July 15, last, probably infected outside, but the third one also has an infectious origin.
Following a series analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new varieties that have not been previously identified here in the country.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a psychiatric expert at the Agricultural Medicine and a local pharmacist, says that the islandic genetic analysis is now going to determine where it is likely that this type of virus has arrived.
“ Another case was a similar virus that has been in use in Switzerland but not exactly the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the probability of what part of the world's infection comes from," she says.
“ But this seems to be here on the Atlantic side. ”
Thus, the infections are not connected to the two who came up at the beginning of July and were driven to the United States.
Do you think that this new species has come outside rather than being mutated here in the country?
“Yes, this is different from what has been found here before that there is no real chance that this was something like this, ” comments Kamilla.
“It is all likely that these individuals were in some way cleared to someone newly arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it for themselves. ”
As asked, it says that yet there is no evidence of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ It could naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but there could also be someone who does not get any symptoms and doesn’t realize that he has infected, and then naturally more infected.
We'll be on the toes of the next few days to watch it."
“ Still there has been no clever group infection.
But there are individuals who went into an illness in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have taken a show," continues Kamilla.
“ We haven’t yet had their results.
So that might be a group infection in a seal."
Do you expect it is being infected by society now?
“ It is not impossible.
It has not been in the past, but it is not excluded because we do not know who brought this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Thursday and yesterday." she answers.
Would it be possible to say that there is a new wave of the virus now?
“No, not yet.
But naturally, we need to be very careful, and we need to keep in mind this, even though there are such limitations on how much we can take from visions in people.
We don't take a show in symptomless people but first that we are getting infected that seems to be inconsistent, we need to be given a little more free hands by taking a show from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, it can be expected that the National Hospital Department of Anti-Virus and Virology will take place in the shows in the next few days to try to map the position in this country better.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the visualization of the country and to take care of scrutiny at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking specimen in individuals who are not in the research tasks; the person must be infected and show symptoms or have received symptoms and suspects of getting clear with someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She argues that smoking is still on the diseases that were diagnosed yesterday and that it is now going to be a great deal of work in obtaining information about the travels of individuals.
It says that the origin of domestic infections seems unrealable, but does not exclude that some of those who have now been infected can provide evidence that ultimately leads the infectious team to the original infections.
The most commonly known hunting place but one of the best

The current owner swallowed his eyes in this house for the sale of Acranes, found a beautiful seaside at the foundation, and fulfilled the dream.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Björgarstein's homepage."

Prins Joakim’s feelings are constantly said
Joakim Danaprin, the younger son of Margrét of Danad Queens and Henrik’s name Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he took action this morning because of blood clots in his brain.
The Danish government radio, DR, has according to the speaker of the Danish Shepherd, that it is uncertain how long the prince, 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
The DR report says that the effect of the blood clot on the prince’s health is now being examined.
According to the physician Peter Qvortrup Geisling, dealing with healthcare for DR, the consequences of blood clots in the brain are often not observed until days after surgery.
“ It can be from negligible symptoms to half - lamb, memories, or difficulty in expressing, ” says Geisling.
He says that the prince could wait for months of rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprins, who is named Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also a grave of Monpezat, stayed in the family's wine farm, Château de Cayx, in Southern France when he was sick on Friday night.
He was first moved to a hospital in the town of Cahor, a short time from the farm, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he was undergoing surgery because of blood clots in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical zoom allows the addition lens on pixel 4 to be seen in a three-width and thus return a better mode in the background with face-image setting than in previous pixels, which trusted the alpha of software to achieve these so-called "bogeh" effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, the Google mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz came up to the scene to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 over the last 12 months.
The system study is still in the foreground in all aspects of the new smartphones from Google and in this phone, "computer-controlled photography" is new to improve the HDR+ setting by merging up to nine different images.
New dual description controls provide different slides for brightness and shadow and enable users to preview HDR+ for real time.
The phone also relied on machine study to offer better automatic whiteness and improve the "Night Sight" night setting, which is so sensitive that it can catch the galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to other camera devices, pixel 4 Soli presents “ratsuration plane” on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can release tracks, switch off time measures, put a waver on the blur or turn off the sound of the phone by waving the hand.
All the calculations of Motion Sense are carried out in the device instead of connecting to the Internet, and the same applies to the re-enhanced Google helper, where the engineer now stresses the shortening of the time of reception and improving the user's privacy.
Continuing emphasis on the full use of its machine study capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that copys sounds directly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
pixel 4 will also be the first phone that supports Google Stadia, a playground in the cloud that will be released from the stands of November 19th in the United States, but still reporting the date for Australia.
In addition to new pixel phones, Google also presented new pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation Google Pixel Buds hearing tools.
The new bluetooth 5.0 smartphone, which is expected in the next year, is completely wireless and has a sound adjustment that listens to the environment and constantly sets the sound in line with it for the best clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smarthorns are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced the update of its connected Wi-Fi home legs in the Nest Wi-Fi line with special bones and many bases that work together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will take up the Nest name, doubles its pre-existence and adds built-in sound sensors and speakers to use the Google helper at each base of the home.
It's sold in Australia on November 5, and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubled the bass and has received built-in wall mounting.
All Google smart speakers will receive new call system features for communication between home devices and the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.

Part of the Jeronimo Open Space area temporarily closed after two plain wolf attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two of the plain wolves were bite near the Oso Creek road at the Jeronimo road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and the route had to be closed temporarily.
Laura Wittmer claims to see a flat wolf almost every morning, and usually she is trying to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bait her in her feet.
The tunnel has been closed while the attacks are investigated.
Mission Viejo-Stadt published a statement that said: “Today two different parties reported that a flat wolf had bided a person. Animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working in the matter in cooperation with the department of fish and animal life, and part of the Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and be careful when you are travelling where there is a lot of wild animals.”
Wittmer tried to squeeze the flat wolf with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she was able to drive for emergency.
The plain wolf disappeared from the sides, but official employees hope to be able to drive him and test him for a dog’s sperm.
Wittmer will be treated for dog sperm as a precautionary measure next two weeks.
She said that this terrifying event would not keep her from the morning races, but from now on she would choose another place.
The condition of the person who was bite is not clear.
The protesters of racial hatred encounter with the police in Seattle
Conflicts in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended by the arrest of many people, but unpleasant cracks among the public due to the plan of the President of the United States of Donald Trump to send a number of federal police into major cities.
Resistance to racial hatred and police violence has occurred after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed dark man, in Minneapolis, May.
On Saturday, protesters in Seattle cut cycling cars and broke windows in wheelhouses on the protests, which resulted in police exclaiming disorders and emptying the streets with pepper sprays and explosions.
The protesters also turned on in the bicycle houses in the building area for the expected adolescent hunting.
The police claimed to have arrested 45 men, but 21 policemen would have hurt.
The protest was held for the support of the Protestants in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the scene light after Trump ordered a lot of rotary actions by the federal police, in the disgrace of local authorities, which tell the police to use excessive power.
Contests have been held in Austin, Texas, and Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the midst of towns on Saturday evening, according to the police.
Together with the Protestants, Trump is increasingly challenging for re-election in November, and has established a tough legal policy.
